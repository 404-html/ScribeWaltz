1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Cain killed Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abel Caine's children killed seven </v>

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.470
<v Speaker 1>canes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren kill 70 fold,</v>

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.860
<v Speaker 1>and then tubilcain pops up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon and he's the person who makes </v>

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 1>artifices of war and so the story in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragmentary manner ties the individual's</v>

5
00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:24.361
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology that's resentful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge seeking to the proclivity for </v>

6
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:29.691
<v Speaker 1>broad scale warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this really hit me because I was </v>

7
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:32.871
<v Speaker 1>interested particularly in what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in the Nazi camps with the </v>

8
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:36.591
<v Speaker 1>guards because the guards were </v>
<v Speaker 1>gratuitously cruel and I was very </v>

9
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>curious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here's an interesting story.</v>

10
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>This was in a book called a ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans,</v>

11
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Hitler's willing executioners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a book that was written about</v>

12
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The challenge,</v>

13
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the Nazi phenomenon was </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught down order following,</v>

14
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>which I don't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way I think that that's a very a </v>

15
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>week we kype orthosis fascistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies are fascistic at every single </v>

16
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>level of organization spiritually within</v>
<v Speaker 1>the family,</v>

17
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>within the local community.</v>

18
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like a holograph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>

19
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not top down.</v>

20
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are leaders who get produced and </v>

21
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.011
<v Speaker 1>maybe they catalyze it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to blame it on the leaders is to </v>

22
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>forget about the process by which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders come to be.</v>

23
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>So No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get a pass that way.</v>

24
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 1>So here's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened as the Nazis started to lose </v>

25
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what you should have done.</v>

26
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>If you are a Nazi and he wanted to win </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war,</v>

27
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>you should have enslaved the Jews and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gypsies and had them work,</v>

28
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should have had them work for the </v>

29
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.241
<v Speaker 1>benefit of the victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you want to liquidate them </v>

30
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the logical thing to do.</v>

31
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>If you want to win and we assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler wanted to win,</v>

32
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a very intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption.</v>

33
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Why would you assume that he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly a good guy?</v>

34
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>So why should we assume that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>aiming at the good that he was </v>

35
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>promoting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in his own terms,</v>

36
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The glorious everlasting for Third </v>

37
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Reich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>That a rule for a thousand years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a bastion of civilization and </v>

39
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>music because that's the sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>he purported to be interested in.</v>

40
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do with the Jews and the </v>

41
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Gypsies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>round them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine in slave and find you.</v>

43
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Don't kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You certainly don't devote a substantial</v>

44
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:21.771
<v Speaker 1>proportion of your war resources well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're losing to accelerate the rate at </v>

45
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:27.471
<v Speaker 1>which the extermination is taking place </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's a bit counterproductive </v>

46
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>unless what you're aiming at is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>maximum possible mayhem in the shortest </v>

47
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>so what happened as the Germans started </v>
<v Speaker 1>to lose the war,</v>

49
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 1>did Hitler lose faith in his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability?</v>

50
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.750
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believed that the Germans had to be </v>

51
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>traded with weakness and so he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly willing to accelerate the rate</v>

52
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:47.451
<v Speaker 1>at which Germany was losing the war and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so when Hitler and his minions had the </v>

53
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the choice.</v>

54
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.390
<v Speaker 1>You can suspend your unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>demolition of people when the damn war </v>

55
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>and then pick it up afterwards or while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're losing.</v>

56
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>You can just accelerate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The may have,</v>

57
00:02:58.441 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>even though it's was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they pick?</v>

58
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they picked to accelerate the mayhem and</v>

59
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>so to me there's an old psychoanalytic </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

60
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.310
<v Speaker 1>I think this was derived by young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't figure out what someone is </v>

61
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.081
<v Speaker 1>doing or why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the outcome and infer the </v>

62
00:03:16.081 --> 00:03:18.930
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it produces may him,</v>

63
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.460
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it was aiming at me hip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

64
00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:26.730
<v Speaker 1>you have to use that dictum carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone's irritating,</v>

65
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's because you're irritable,</v>

66
00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:33.771
<v Speaker 1>had you should sort yourself out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it's because they're actually </v>

67
00:03:33.771 --> 00:03:35.190
<v Speaker 1>aiming at irritating you and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual motivation.</v>

68
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.730
<v Speaker 1>So perhaps not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's another tool in your analytical</v>

69
00:03:38.731 --> 00:03:42.690
<v Speaker 1>armament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and so you see,</v>

70
00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:45.420
<v Speaker 1>well this is the thing about warfare </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so interesting about,</v>

71
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.550
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can,</v>

72
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.670
<v Speaker 1>you can attribute it to territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let you can attribute it to a war for </v>

73
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.250
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the,</v>

74
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I would say wretchedly</v>

75
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>simple minded economists presume people </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight over scarce resources.</v>

76
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

77
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.300
<v Speaker 1>we're a little bit more sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

78
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.820
<v Speaker 1>And first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what resources are you talking about?</v>

79
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.590
<v Speaker 1>The bloody anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had nothing.</v>

80
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.480
<v Speaker 1>They live perfectly well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they have?</v>

81
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Snow and seal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blubber.</v>

82
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can live and unbelievably </v>

83
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.711
<v Speaker 1>deprived conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the idea that there are natural </v>

84
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:27.731
<v Speaker 1>resources that we fight over because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a shortage of them is a pretty </v>

85
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:28.250
<v Speaker 1>oversimplified view of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

86
00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:29.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do people fight?</v>

87
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they fight sometimes for good </v>

88
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very,</v>

89
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.451
<v Speaker 1>very frequently they fight for bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons and those bad reasons are our </v>

90
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:39.800
<v Speaker 1>personal as well as sociocultural and </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic.</v>

91
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were announced a prison guard,</v>

92
00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:46.751
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever pathologies you were carrying </v>

93
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:49.631
<v Speaker 1>around in your destructive little soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever element of Cain was deeply </v>

94
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:53.111
<v Speaker 1>embedded in you had the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be manifest foley at every moment of </v>

95
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:53.111
<v Speaker 1>your waking existence.</v>

96
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had these people who were completely</v>

97
00:04:55.341 --> 00:04:58.190
<v Speaker 1>beholden to you with no rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

98
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.630
<v Speaker 1>to whom you could do whatever you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil little heart determined think,</v>

99
00:05:02.631 --> 00:05:07.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that was a motivation for putting </v>

100
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:07.631
<v Speaker 1>them there to begin with and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover story about,</v>

101
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to build the Third Reich </v>

102
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.601
<v Speaker 1>and we're trying to stabilize the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're trying to do all these good </v>

103
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:16.421
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's just a cover story for the </v>

104
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:16.421
<v Speaker 1>real motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is nothing but,</v>

105
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:19.640
<v Speaker 1>but what the construction of death camps</v>
<v Speaker 1>that killed 6 million people,</v>

106
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.990
<v Speaker 1>how about that and the obliteration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>120 million people on the planet and the</v>

107
00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:27.350
<v Speaker 1>and the and the and the leaving of </v>
<v Speaker 1>European runes.</v>

108
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that was the motivation or are we </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to attribute to Hitler the highest</v>

109
00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:33.680
<v Speaker 1>possible motives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say No,</v>

110
00:05:33.681 --> 00:05:35.930
<v Speaker 1>it's an archetype of manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cane.</v>

111
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Now he's going to put up a front that </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

112
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm your savior.</v>

113
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

114
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.980
<v Speaker 1>destructive people think that cane is </v>
<v Speaker 1>their savior.</v>
