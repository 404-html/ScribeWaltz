00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Being a highly creative woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find myself fearful that having kids </v>

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>will be spiritual suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hindering my endeavors,</v>

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>but I also don't want to have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfulfilled life.</v>

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Can I have a full life without kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:13.090
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

6
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I suspect you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's risky because it's really </v>

7
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.651
<v Speaker 1>important for people to have kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the thing is is that you get </v>

8
00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>older than 40 and our culture is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dopey in that regards.</v>

9
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>It's underdeveloped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live as if we live as if we.</v>

10
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>We only exist when we're young and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

11
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do from the ages </v>

12
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 1>of say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 to 90 or 95?</v>

13
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a family around you.</v>

14
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>You need to see your children grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to have grandchildren.</v>

15
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:45.291
<v Speaker 1>It's a major part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the most important part of the </v>

16
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>last half of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

17
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.900
<v Speaker 1>You said being a highly creative woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find myself fearful that having kids </v>

18
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>will be spiritual suicide.</v>

19
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the part of your question that I </v>

20
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 1>would really address because I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

21
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't let them be spiritual suicide.</v>

22
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.570
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be that there's a certain amount </v>

23
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>of time that you need to take away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids that,</v>

24
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>and this is the case for parents in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

25
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can pursue your own creative</v>

26
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>endeavors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's children do not have to devour your</v>

27
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

28
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:16.731
<v Speaker 1>if you let them devour your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll hate them and you mistreat </v>

29
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:20.511
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you want to do is to set </v>

30
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:23.241
<v Speaker 1>yourself up so that you can have </v>
<v Speaker 1>children and have a life and that's </v>

31
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>better for the children and it's better </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

32
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Like children can be taught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraged to spend a fair bit of time,</v>

33
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>not when they're infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

34
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>but to spend a fair bit of time amusing </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

35
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's especially the case if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have more than one child because they'll</v>

36
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.180
<v Speaker 1>mutually amuse one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually easier in some ways to </v>

37
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.751
<v Speaker 1>have more than one child because with </v>
<v Speaker 1>one child you're constantly abusing the </v>

38
00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with two or three,</v>

39
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:50.031
<v Speaker 1>then they're off in their little club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you can stop them from </v>

40
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:54.440
<v Speaker 1>developing sibling rivalry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's too intense and they can monitor </v>

41
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the trick is,</v>

42
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:59.991
<v Speaker 1>if you're a highly creative woman is be </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable it now so that you can </v>

43
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:03.141
<v Speaker 1>carve yourself out your own space so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't come to resent your </v>

44
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're afraid of that.</v>

45
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>You're afraid that it looks like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid that if you,</v>

46
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.870
<v Speaker 1>if you give yourself two children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be nothing left for you.</v>

47
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>that can happen if you have children who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have terrible health problems,</v>

49
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:18.831
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't protect yourself against </v>

50
00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 1>those eventualities in life anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say your best bet is to be a</v>

51
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>more selfish mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>

52
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I've had more clients who were ruined by</v>
<v Speaker 1>mothers who were too unselfish than.</v>

53
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>I've had clients who were ruined by </v>
<v Speaker 1>mothers who were too selfish.</v>

54
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>you need to be there when the kids need </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

56
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't be there any more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>is necessarily.</v>

57
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

58
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.980
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

59
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Adam Watts's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feared having kids for the same </v>

60
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a full time pro artist.</v>

61
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 1>You make your own normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

62
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:56.510
<v Speaker 1>my therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jp is speaking the truth.</v>

63
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

64
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

65
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.870
<v Speaker 1>don't be thinking that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize your life when you have </v>

66
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.521
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about modern people is that </v>

67
00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:13.621
<v Speaker 1>they're terrified of children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They in this because they think they </v>

68
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>regard children as if they're miniature </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrants and they can be of course,</v>

69
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:21.931
<v Speaker 1>because anyone will tyrannized over you </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you allow them to perhaps not anyone </v>

70
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:27.901
<v Speaker 1>but virtually anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not regulate your children's </v>

71
00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:28.760
<v Speaker 1>behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a chapter in my new book called,</v>

72
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.290
<v Speaker 1>don't let your children do anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you dislike them and that's like </v>

73
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.770
<v Speaker 1>really serious advice is like if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow your children to conduct </v>

74
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>themselves around you in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you dislike them.</v>

75
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>If you're being honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're paying attention to the shadow</v>

76
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 1>side of yourself that can be aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and destructive,</v>

77
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.770
<v Speaker 1>then then you're.</v>

78
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>If you allow your children to do things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that make you dislike them,</v>

79
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>then they're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're having children is going to mess</v>

80
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>up your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to do that.</v>

81
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 1>You're actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually have a tremendous amount of</v>

82
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>control over the quality of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with your children and also</v>

83
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which you choose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>disperse your time and I mean you're,</v>

84
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.650
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're willing to think it through </v>

85
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 1>and be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be in charge of your household.</v>

86
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.340
<v Speaker 1>The children don't have to be in charge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not good for them to be in </v>

87
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.671
<v Speaker 1>charge anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people are afraid of children and </v>

88
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>it's too bad because children are </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely wonderful.</v>

89
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:32.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be careful with them and </v>

90
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:32.731
<v Speaker 1>they get tired and they get hungry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get hot and,</v>

91
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>and they don't have an attention span.</v>

92
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>That's as long as an adult who has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long attention span,</v>

93
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>but they're great company and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably comical and they love you.</v>

94
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:48.301
<v Speaker 1>And like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give back far more than they take </v>

95
00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>if you have an ounce of sense when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with them.</v>

96
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.220
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

97
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 1>so don't be afraid of children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

98
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.770
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the adult for God's sake.</v>

99
00:04:56.771 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 1>You've got the upper hand and and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a partner you can rely on,</v>

100
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:05.371
<v Speaker 1>well then you know you can both decide </v>
<v Speaker 1>how it is that you're going to run your </v>

101
00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 1>household so that you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrilled to death,</v>

102
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 1>that you have kids and that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
