1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Does being around groups of people make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you energetic or does it exhausts you,</v>

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.180
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're the sort of person that will </v>

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.180
<v Speaker 1>go to a party and interact with 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

4
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Indian and you have to go home and be by</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself for like two weeks,</v>

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.560
<v Speaker 1>then you're introverted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Introverts are exhausted by social </v>

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extroverts are the opposite.</v>

7
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

8
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>they're energized by social interactions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

10
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:29.241
<v Speaker 1>you might be in the middle so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take it or leave it with regards to </v>

11
00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:32.961
<v Speaker 1>social interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're happy to go to them and </v>

12
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:32.961
<v Speaker 1>you're happy to spend time by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a real extrovert.</v>

13
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:37.881
<v Speaker 1>There'll be some of you in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you can't stand spending </v>

14
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:37.881
<v Speaker 1>time alone?</v>

15
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's only two that will admit it.</v>

16
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Extroverts are more likely to admit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing too,</v>

17
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:49.401
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then how many of you you like to </v>

18
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:49.401
<v Speaker 1>spend time alone or would rather be </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone?</v>

19
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there is a preponderance of </v>

20
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>introverts in this class is by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

21
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>by all appearances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a really,</v>

22
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty canonical question for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for extroversion versus introversion.</v>

23
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a very stable trait by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It manifests itself early in life and </v>

24
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 1>it's stable across the age span,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not completely.</v>

25
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Introverts can learn to be extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to extroverts,</v>

26
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:15.111
<v Speaker 1>can learn to spend time on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that actually your capacity to </v>

27
00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:19.521
<v Speaker 1>expand your ability past the initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints of your biological </v>

28
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:24.021
<v Speaker 1>temperament is something like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of character or wisdom you </v>

29
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're an introvert by nature and </v>

30
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.961
<v Speaker 1>you learn how to be extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that expands your domain of </v>

31
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:29.961
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>

32
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>And if you're extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learned to be introverted.</v>

33
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:35.991
<v Speaker 1>The same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like imagine a </v>

34
00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:35.991
<v Speaker 1>distribution of extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>introversion here,</v>

35
00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>extroversion here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a normal distribution you're set when </v>

36
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>you're young at somewhere along that </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution with some range around it.</v>

37
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think what you do as you mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you develop your skills as you expand</v>

38
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>that range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're set,</v>

39
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>the place at which you're set doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>move that much.</v>

40
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's.</v>

41
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities.</v>

42
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>You can think about them as frames of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference.</v>

43
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>So frame of reference would be something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

44
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since you're extroverted,</v>

45
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.840
<v Speaker 1>you value being with people and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>

46
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Look at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

47
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>if you're extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come into a room like this,</v>

48
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

49
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole field of opportunity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>social interactions.</v>

50
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:18.501
<v Speaker 1>And if you're introverted you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe I'll go sit up in the corner </v>

51
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:18.501
<v Speaker 1>and everybody leaves me the hell alone.</v>
