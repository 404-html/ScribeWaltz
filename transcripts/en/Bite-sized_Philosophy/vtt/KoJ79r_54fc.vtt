1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what does the frame look like?</v>

2
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it looks something like this,</v>

3
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:07.290
<v Speaker 1>and this is as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the bare bones.</v>

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>This is the bare bones of a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

5
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a barebone story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bare bone conceptual framework.</v>

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a bare bone [inaudible] scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak in Heideggerian terms.</v>

7
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:19.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the bare bones world that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in.</v>

8
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>You're always in one of these worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting out of them.</v>

9
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.310
<v Speaker 1>You can move from one to another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're always in a world like this </v>

10
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.491
<v Speaker 1>and so this is the world that you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're somewhere because you have to be </v>

11
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>somewhere now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not know where that is,</v>

12
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>which means that somewhere that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>is chaotic,</v>

13
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.740
<v Speaker 1>in which case you need to go over your </v>
<v Speaker 1>past in great detail and figure out </v>

14
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>where you are.</v>

15
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lost,</v>

16
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>and the problem with being last is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lost,</v>

17
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.790
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with not knowing where </v>

18
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>to go is there's a million places that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could go and a million places is too</v>

19
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>many places for you to go without dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So being lost is not good.</v>

20
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>So you need to know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we built online,</v>

21
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:07.821
<v Speaker 1>my partners and I is this program called</v>
<v Speaker 1>past authoring that helps people lay out</v>

22
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.710
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

23
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>the narrative of their past to identify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to break their life down into six </v>

24
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.401
<v Speaker 1>stages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>epochs we called them and then to </v>

25
00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:21.561
<v Speaker 1>identify the emotionally significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments in each park and to write them </v>

26
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>out what happened negatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened positively,</v>

27
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 1>what the consequences were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you derive from it,</v>

28
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 1>perhaps what you could've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>

29
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:34.191
<v Speaker 1>perhaps what you learned from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that so that you can narrow in </v>

30
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:38.210
<v Speaker 1>zero in on determining precisely where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that you are right now.</v>

31
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>And people are often loathe to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they actually don't want to know</v>

32
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.940
<v Speaker 1>because they'd rather be spread out in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of half blind manner in the fog.</v>

33
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Hoping that the place that they're at is</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than it really is.</v>

34
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>And deluding themselves by remaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>vague than to figure out I'm right here </v>

35
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.451
<v Speaker 1>right now with these specific problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually better to to do that </v>

36
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:06.240
<v Speaker 1>because if you have a set of specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and you've really narrowed them</v>

37
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:11.241
<v Speaker 1>down and really specified them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can probably start fixing them </v>

38
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>and you can start fixing them and Mike </v>
<v Speaker 1>Microwave's bit by bit,</v>

39
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>but there's no way you can do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>without knowing where you are.</v>

40
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible and you can kind of tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know where you are.</v>

41
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>It's quite straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are haunted by reveries of the </v>

42
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:31.170
<v Speaker 1>past for events that are older than </v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately 18 months.</v>

43
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.170
<v Speaker 1>If they continue to come up in your mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and your dreams over and </v>

44
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.591
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't extracted the world out from</v>

45
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:44.901
<v Speaker 1>your past experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That potential is still trapped in the </v>

46
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>past and to confront the potential means</v>
<v Speaker 1>to confront the dragon of the past.</v>

47
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And 17 seriously be terrifying.</v>

48
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:55.260
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're vague and ill formed an ill</v>

49
00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>defined because you were abused very </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly when you were a child.</v>

50
00:02:57.961 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Four years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that,</v>

51
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you were abused by a family </v>
<v Speaker 1>member because that's generally who does</v>

52
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>the music and so that just makes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>

53
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>and then what that means is that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a implicit.</v>

54
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.790
<v Speaker 1>You had an implicit encountered with </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent evil that no,</v>

55
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>you've had a direct encounter with </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent evil,</v>

56
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>but you have an implicit hypothesis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent evil that's plaguing you.</v>

57
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>It's still there.</v>

58
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>It's trapped in the memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.490
<v Speaker 1>It's trapped in the representational </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and as an adult you're now </v>

60
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.301
<v Speaker 1>faced with the necessity of articulating</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fully before you have any chance </v>

61
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever of freeing yourself from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's no joke.</v>

62
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Lots of times people have to go into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

63
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>That's what the psychoanalysts do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

64
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.460
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's something came along and just </v>

65
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>bloody well knocked me over and it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even that I repressed it,</v>

66
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think was,</v>

67
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we won't talk about Freud's errors </v>

68
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>because freud was a genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll just leave him alone.</v>

69
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's not repression.</v>

70
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:58.981
<v Speaker 1>It's just the terrible things happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people at such a young age that there </v>

71
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>isn't a bloody chance in hell that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can figure out why they happened or what</v>

72
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>to do with them or what they mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can carry that with you and</v>

73
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>you carry it with you.</v>

74
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like fear your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body encounters the world in stages</v>

75
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>and it happens very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.600
<v Speaker 1>it can extend over years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the initial stages happened very </v>

77
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.600
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

78
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.070
<v Speaker 1>if you're walking down the road and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear a large noise be a loud noise </v>

79
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.070
<v Speaker 1>behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll go like this.</v>

80
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a Predator defense response by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you crouched down and that's to </v>

81
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>stop something from jumping on your back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and getting out your neck too easily.</v>

82
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>That's like a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few hundred milliseconds.</v>

83
00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:38.251
<v Speaker 1>It's really faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even faster than that and it better be </v>

84
00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:38.251
<v Speaker 1>because something like a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll say,</v>

85
00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:40.690
<v Speaker 1>can nail you just right now so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>better be fast,</v>

86
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's low resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like dangerous snake,</v>

87
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 1>something like that or danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory cap.</v>

88
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.570
<v Speaker 1>It's that faxed and then you can unravel</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and categorize it,</v>

89
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>but that takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do that with emotion and then you do</v>

90
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:58.800
<v Speaker 1>it with cognition and you can do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with longterm thinking,</v>

91
00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because maybe you've encountered someone</v>

92
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:05.671
<v Speaker 1>specifically malevolent and predatory at</v>
<v Speaker 1>work and it happens to people a lot who </v>

93
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:09.681
<v Speaker 1>was operating as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a destructive bully and who seems to </v>

94
00:05:09.681 --> 00:05:13.621
<v Speaker 1>have no positive function whatsoever and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the only living that out and then </v>

95
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what to do about it.</v>

96
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in prey mode.</v>

97
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean this kind of mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although that would help too,</v>

98
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.490
<v Speaker 1>but I mean you're acting like a prey </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal and then you have this terribly </v>

99
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.211
<v Speaker 1>complex thing to decompose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what the hell is up with this </v>

100
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they making my life miserable?</v>

101
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>What is it about B that allows them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make my life miserable?</v>

102
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a nasty little road to walk down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're stuck with having to.</v>

103
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck with having to decompose </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

104
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe formulating and explicit </v>

105
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of good and evil to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something malevolent in your environment</v>

106
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 1>actually just happens to be beyond you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that could easily be.</v>

107
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:58.531
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly the case for people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are young and it's the case for plenty </v>

108
00:05:58.531 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>of adults as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no simple thing to matt to manage.</v>

109
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.020
<v Speaker 1>It's something too that often soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have posttraumatic stress disorder </v>

110
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>have to do because they've encountered </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible things.</v>

111
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 1>They've either done them or read into </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they need to update their moral</v>

112
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:15.131
<v Speaker 1>model of the world or if they end up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>something close closely approximating </v>

113
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 1>hell anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you need to know where you are.</v>

114
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>That's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is.</v>

115
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're navigating your navigator.</v>

116
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:27.130
<v Speaker 1>You're a sailor on an ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

117
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you are.</v>

118
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 1>You're a mobile creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going from point a to point b all</v>

119
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:33.890
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not sitting there glued to a rock</v>

120
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>like some brainless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.500
<v Speaker 1>sea creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a funny little creature called a</v>

122
00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:43.501
<v Speaker 1>hydra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very simple little creature needs </v>

123
00:06:43.501 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>juvenile stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a brain because it swings around,</v>

124
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:49.661
<v Speaker 1>but then when it turns into an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it latches itself to Iraq and promptly </v>

125
00:06:49.661 --> 00:06:54.311
<v Speaker 1>digests it's brain because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sitting on a rock and you're not </v>

126
00:06:54.311 --> 00:06:54.311
<v Speaker 1>moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need a brain.</v>

127
00:06:54.311 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not our issue,</v>

128
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're zipping around in the world and so</v>

129
00:06:57.381 --> 00:07:00.020
<v Speaker 1>we're navigating agents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to navigate,</v>

130
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 1>there's two things you need to know and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first is where the hell are you?</v>

131
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Precisely right.</v>

132
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Razor sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's good about you and what's bad </v>

133
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 1>about you buy your own buyer own </v>
<v Speaker 1>reckoning.</v>

134
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can ask other people,</v>

135
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 1>but this is a game you play yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like as far as I'm concerned,</v>

136
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it that's okay about being what </v>

137
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.921
<v Speaker 1>needs some work and you got to watch to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be too self critical when you're </v>

138
00:07:26.921 --> 00:07:27.770
<v Speaker 1>doing that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that can just be another kind of</v>

139
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 1>flaw.</v>
