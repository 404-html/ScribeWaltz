1
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to read you a story.</v>

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.670
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me give you a little background </v>

3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.921
<v Speaker 1>to this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This story popped into my head in one </v>

4
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:14.470
<v Speaker 1>chunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like complete,</v>

5
00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:19.471
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was kind of interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was also a story that emerged in </v>

6
00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:25.141
<v Speaker 1>solution to a problem I'd been thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about for a long time because I was </v>

7
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:26.020
<v Speaker 1>dealing with this guy who didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow up.</v>

8
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>So he's caught in a kind of Peter Pan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Situation and Peter Pan Pan means </v>

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

10
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.241
<v Speaker 1>pan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pantheistic and Peter Pan is a </v>

11
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:36.760
<v Speaker 1>child who won't grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's magical.</v>

12
00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

13
00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:39.160
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children live in a magical world,</v>

14
00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're rife with possibility.</v>

15
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.690
<v Speaker 1>He's magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to grow up.</v>

16
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.200
<v Speaker 1>So he lives in Neverland with the lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>

17
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Neverland doesn't really exist in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost boys are obviously boys who haven't</v>

18
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.460
<v Speaker 1>managed to establish some mode of big </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's in constant battle with Captain</v>

19
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Hook and captain hook's a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

20
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 1>A pirate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a negative manifestation of the negative</v>

21
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:07.651
<v Speaker 1>archetype of social order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Captain Kirk is always fighting </v>

22
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:11.431
<v Speaker 1>Peter Pan Because Peter Pan Represents </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood and vulnerability and he </v>

23
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:15.481
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to be vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're locked in this sort of </v>

24
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.731
<v Speaker 1>eternal battle and lots of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think more commonly men but not </v>

25
00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:23.380
<v Speaker 1>necessarily get caught in this Peter Pan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem.</v>

26
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.240
<v Speaker 1>So I was dealing with</v>

27
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.650
<v Speaker 1>person who was caught in this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to grow up,</v>

28
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:32.390
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't sacrifice childhood.</v>

29
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>And so this story popped into my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called Cock-a-doodle-doo.</v>

30
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Once upon a time there was a man who had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long,</v>

31
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:46.461
<v Speaker 1>hard journey ahead of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trudging along the way over </v>

32
00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:50.031
<v Speaker 1>boulders and through brushes when he saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little shiny known with big white </v>

33
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>teeth in the block to pay sitting by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the road,</v>

34
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>he was drumming on a log with two white </v>
<v Speaker 1>bones and humming oddly to himself.</v>

35
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>A little gnome said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

36
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>why work so hard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why I walked so fast?</v>

37
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Who knows if you'll ever get there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

38
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>come over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have something to show you.</v>

39
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.280
<v Speaker 1>So John Walked off the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was sick of walking anyway because </v>

40
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>people kept throwing sticks and stones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam little gnome said,</v>

41
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I have a shiny red jewel that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to sell you cheap.</v>

42
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Here it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for beneath his cloak he pulled the </v>

43
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.851
<v Speaker 1>biggest ruby that the man I'd ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must've weighed 100 pounds and it's </v>

44
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>shine like the sun.</v>

45
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.620
<v Speaker 1>The gnome said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you like it?</v>

46
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.370
<v Speaker 1>It's an enchanted stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will you offer me for it?</v>

47
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.490
<v Speaker 1>And the man said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have much,</v>

48
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.400
<v Speaker 1>much money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll give you everything I have the </v>

49
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.890
<v Speaker 1>no look displeased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So John added,</v>

50
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.880
<v Speaker 1>or I could pay some more monthly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the GNOME excepted.</v>

51
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buy Now.</v>

52
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Pay later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good for me.</v>

53
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for the installment plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the man gave him all his money and </v>

54
00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>promise to pay the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later,</v>

55
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>and the gnome walk back into the Bush by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road,</v>

56
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>clacking his teeth and giggling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitching.</v>

57
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>The more of the man thought about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruby and the great deal he got,</v>

58
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>the happier he became.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started back on the road with a light</v>

59
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:16.891
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but soon discovered that he couldn't </v>

60
00:03:16.891 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>make much progress because 100 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a lot to carry.</v>

61
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>He said to himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why continue anyways,</v>

62
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>I have what I want.</v>

63
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll just stand here holding my ruby and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people walk by they can see how </v>

64
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>well I've already done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he stopped a little while.</v>

65
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>One of his little while later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his friends came along,</v>

66
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:34.370
<v Speaker 1>so I'm standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fair,</v>

67
00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

68
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.950
<v Speaker 1>why don't you come along with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just opened a new business and I </v>

69
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>could really use some help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come along quick.</v>

70
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.330
<v Speaker 1>It will be opening soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

71
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>and thought that sounded good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his friend was in a hurry besides </v>

72
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>couldn't even see the ruby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could he speed along beside him?</v>

73
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Where would he put his jewel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>

74
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>thanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to take care of my jewel.</v>

75
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll see you later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His friend looked at him like he was </v>

76
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.981
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was trying to get somewhere </v>

77
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:04.981
<v Speaker 1>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it just shrugged a bit and said,</v>

78
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:04.981
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

79
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>see you later.</v>

80
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Then he sped on down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little while later.</v>

81
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Another friend came by and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

82
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 1>nice to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going back to school.</v>

83
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of wonderful things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn,</v>

84
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>great things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is full of unsolved problems.</v>

85
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I could use some company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you like to come along?</v>

86
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.110
<v Speaker 1>John Thought that sounded pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this friend who looked like he was </v>

87
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.110
<v Speaker 1>in a hurry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sorry.</v>

88
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Started standing beside the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding the jewel was tiring and he </v>

89
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 1>needed all the energy ad for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he said to his friend,</v>

90
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>thanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to take care of my jewel.</v>

91
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it beautiful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll see you later.</v>

92
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 1>His friend looked at him like he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

93
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>but he was trying to get somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick,</v>

94
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 1>so he just shrugged and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope.</v>

95
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Everything goes all right with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you later.</v>

96
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Many friends came and went in the years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went by,</v>

97
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.360
<v Speaker 1>the jewel got heavier and heavier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the man God more and more attached </v>

98
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.171
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing was nobody seemed to </v>

99
00:05:01.171 --> 00:05:03.841
<v Speaker 1>notice how beautiful it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would rush by and talk about </v>

100
00:05:03.841 --> 00:05:07.111
<v Speaker 1>their plans and nobody had a ruby as big</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody seemed likely to get A.</v>

101
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Ruby is big and you think that someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>might've had said something like at </v>

102
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.950
<v Speaker 1>least Nice Ruby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

103
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.300
<v Speaker 1>sure wish I had one like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it never happened.</v>

104
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Then one day someone new came down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

105
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>He was bent over and he was thin and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair was gray.</v>

106
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Although he didn't look that old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was carrying a big dirty rock </v>

107
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>carefully in his arms and he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>making much progress.</v>

108
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.040
<v Speaker 1>The strange figure approached and </v>
<v Speaker 1>glanced up at John and he grinned and </v>

109
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you standing there so stupidly</v>

110
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>with a big ugly rock and you're tired.</v>

111
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Old Hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look pretty daft.</v>

112
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>I bet you wish you had a big ruby like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one I am carrying.</v>

113
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>And John Thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this poor man is diluted.</v>

114
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.150
<v Speaker 1>He's carrying a rock it desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the ruby.</v>

115
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me sir,</v>

116
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:53.470
<v Speaker 1>but you are sadly mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one with the jewel.</v>

117
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I met a little known by the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road and he sold it to me.</v>

118
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm still paying for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although not so very much.</v>

119
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 1>You are carrying a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tired stranger looked annoyed.</v>

120
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what game you're playing,</v>

121
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Mr you have a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a jewel.</v>

122
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 1>The little gnome you described sold it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me and he said it was the only one.</v>

123
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 1>I've been carrying it for 20 years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never let it go,</v>

124
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.340
<v Speaker 1>and John said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd been carrying mine for 20 years </v>

125
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.340
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

126
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>It can be just a rock rocker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewel on and on.</v>

127
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:31.211
<v Speaker 1>They argued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly out stepped a little gnome as </v>

128
00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 1>if he'd never left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only this time he wasn't so little.</v>

129
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.910
<v Speaker 1>He was bigger and redder and menacing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his laugh sounded like the rattling </v>

130
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>of chains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quit arguing you too.</v>

131
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a site quite so </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathetic.</v>

132
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>You're carrying rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of you,</v>

133
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 1>and if you would have ever had the sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put them down for a second or two,</v>

134
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>you would have seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well,</v>

135
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 1>at least you were diligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played a mean trick.</v>

136
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to give you what you really</v>

137
00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 1>deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want what you really deserve?</v>

138
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>And John and the thin stranger nodded </v>
<v Speaker 1>eagerly.</v>

139
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought you haven't seen anything </v>

140
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throw down your rocks,</v>

141
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.680
<v Speaker 1>so John and the thin stranger obeyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He trucked split down the middle of when</v>

142
00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:20.681
<v Speaker 1>it hit the ground outflow to river of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ravenous white worms which rushed </v>

143
00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:24.941
<v Speaker 1>towards the men and devoured them whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>while they thrashed about and screamed </v>

144
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.400
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing was left except a leg bone from </v>

145
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.640
<v Speaker 1>each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little gnome pick them up and walked</v>

146
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:36.641
<v Speaker 1>off the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sat down by a hollow log and started </v>

147
00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:40.331
<v Speaker 1>to drop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drummed any waited and he hummed and </v>

148
00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:44.201
<v Speaker 1>odd little tune picture of food feeds </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole hungry clan,</v>

149
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.950
<v Speaker 1>the image of good mix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole healthy man.</v>

150
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Why walk for miles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do the work?</v>

151
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Just smile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The smile,</v>

152
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.150
<v Speaker 1>success after all is a quirk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life isn't real.</v>

153
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 1>That's the message I give.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy that way.</v>

154
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Plus who wants to live?</v>

155
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.110
<v Speaker 1>So needless to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy that I was telling this story to</v>

156
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:19.150
<v Speaker 1>never listened to it and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really didn't go well for him for a </v>

157
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.510
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time and they really didn't go well</v>

158
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:25.511
<v Speaker 1>for him until he was willing to give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the things he was carrying </v>

159
00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:25.820
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had acquired,</v>

160
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:30.821
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a number of things that he couldn't </v>

161
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:32.470
<v Speaker 1>afford and the fact that he was carrying</v>
<v Speaker 1>them right,</v>

162
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.580
<v Speaker 1>paying for them month after month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

163
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:39.790
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't afford to get an education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was perfectly willing to sacrifice </v>

164
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:43.460
<v Speaker 1>the possibility of getting an education </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the image of success rather than the</v>

165
00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:44.420
<v Speaker 1>reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

166
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.610
<v Speaker 1>And he was completely irritated at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world because he had all these trappings</v>

167
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:53.050
<v Speaker 1>of success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which no one he admired also admired and</v>

168
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.060
<v Speaker 1>he absolutely wasn't getting anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he thought that was tremendously </v>

169
00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.620
<v Speaker 1>unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the truth of the matter was that how</v>

170
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 1>do you put down what he was carrying for</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a moment?</v>

171
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Then he would have been able to get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he wanted to go.</v>

172
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:10.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's a motif that succinctly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically describes the necessity for</v>

173
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
