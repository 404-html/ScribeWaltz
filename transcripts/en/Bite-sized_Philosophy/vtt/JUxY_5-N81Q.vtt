1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.780
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 1>what's your evidence that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in personality aren't </v>

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.270
<v Speaker 1>culturally constructed and the evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that,</v>

4
00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:08.830
<v Speaker 1>it's quite clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go online,</v>

5
00:00:08.831 --> 00:00:13.831
<v Speaker 1>you look up the Scandinavian studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go online and look up gender </v>

6
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>differences in personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>cross-culturally.</v>

7
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.860
<v Speaker 1>You'll find the relevant studies they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been done with tens of thousands of </v>

8
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.771
<v Speaker 1>people or something she'll write clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in those societies where the most is </v>

9
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>being done to move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move the social world into a position of</v>

10
00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:31.981
<v Speaker 1>radical equality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that would roughly be the </v>

11
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian countries because they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done more than that,</v>

12
00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:37.321
<v Speaker 1>more of that than any other country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The personality differences between men </v>

13
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:39.550
<v Speaker 1>and women maximize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't minimize,</v>

14
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.810
<v Speaker 1>they maximize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll say that again in the countries</v>

15
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>where they're most has been done to </v>
<v Speaker 1>equalize that playing field between men </v>

16
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.001
<v Speaker 1>and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men and women get more different rather </v>

17
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.211
<v Speaker 1>than more of the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for all your social constructionists </v>

18
00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:00.451
<v Speaker 1>out there in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's probably not that many of </v>

19
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:02.591
<v Speaker 1>you because you wouldn't come in here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and be talked to her social </v>

20
00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:02.591
<v Speaker 1>constructionist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're actually wrong.</v>

21
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is,</v>

23
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.070
<v Speaker 2>thank you,</v>

24
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.580
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things you might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in is that it's all the same </v>

25
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.881
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subsets like when I was looking into </v>

26
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:27.670
<v Speaker 1>this to begin with in this group started</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 25 years ago,</v>

27
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:31.000
<v Speaker 1>looking at differences in personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>between men and women,</v>

28
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't go at all whether they were </v>

29
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally biological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological are fundamentally associate,</v>

30
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 1>large boiler or mixed produced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>

31
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one knew and the most logical </v>

32
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.181
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis was that as you need wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this society that men and women would </v>

33
00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:50.830
<v Speaker 1>become more of the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is not what happened.</v>

34
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 1>And so we've actually looked at social </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructionist hypothesis with regards </v>

35
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.490
<v Speaker 1>to gender differences in insects and </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

36
00:01:57.491 --> 00:02:02.491
<v Speaker 1>We'll put that to the test and a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense way and the social </v>

37
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:05.521
<v Speaker 1>constructionist viewpoint fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very strange because no one was </v>

38
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:05.870
<v Speaker 1>already believed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

39
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.930
<v Speaker 1>If you make this make society one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same in men and women get more </v>

40
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.930
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

41
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>what's up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:15.310
<v Speaker 1>the answer seems to be is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally two sources of variability</v>

43
00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:16.480
<v Speaker 1>in personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

44
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>There's perhaps more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can categorize them as roughly </v>

45
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.140
<v Speaker 1>genetic and roughly sociological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

46
00:02:23.141 --> 00:02:28.141
<v Speaker 1>if you take out all the sociological </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between the landscape in </v>

47
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:32.761
<v Speaker 1>which men and women are raped and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have left are the biological and </v>

48
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:33.580
<v Speaker 1>genetic differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they maximize,</v>

49
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what happened.</v>

50
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>This actually matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really matters and this is why that </v>

51
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>demands for equity or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.950
<v Speaker 1>there's 15 reasons why demands for </v>
<v Speaker 1>equity order on this is between men and </v>

53
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.161
<v Speaker 1>women should not be overlooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly because it's wrong to overlook </v>

54
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 1>the junior with differences between men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women.</v>

55
00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:54.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for the man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for the women.</v>

56
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.590
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you see in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia,</v>

57
00:02:56.591 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there's an overwhelming preponderance</v>

58
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.110
<v Speaker 1>female nurses and there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming preponderance of male </v>

59
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>engineers and actually the data on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on personality differences.</v>

60
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

61
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the standard traits which will </v>

62
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>continue to go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do that quite quickly.</v>

63
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>There's no much difference in trait </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness between men and women.</v>

64
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 1>If you break it down into the aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are a bit more orderly than men,</v>

65
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>but there's no difference in </v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness and then with regards to</v>

66
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the intelligence,</v>

67
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>

68
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:35.131
<v Speaker 1>dimension overall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between men and </v>

69
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:35.131
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you break it up into the aspects,</v>

70
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>then the differences are actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced.</v>

71
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>So what you have is the openness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience is the technical trade and it</v>

72
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.560
<v Speaker 1>roughly breaks down into something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of like created creativity </v>

73
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.831
<v Speaker 1>and aesthetic interests versus the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in ideas and what you see is </v>

74
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:53.821
<v Speaker 1>that women are a third of the standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviation higher than men in terms of of</v>

75
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>creativity and aesthetic aesthetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclivity,</v>

76
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:02.731
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and men or month or the standard </v>

77
00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Speaker 1>deviation higher than women in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in ideas and it's not a trivial</v>

78
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 1>difference and it makes a difference.</v>

79
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the biggest difference between men </v>

80
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.291
<v Speaker 1>and women as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is almost one standard </v>

81
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:13.410
<v Speaker 1>deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a wall of indifference.</v>

82
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.420
<v Speaker 1>You never see that in social sciences </v>
<v Speaker 1>and massive difference is the difference</v>

83
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 1>between difference in interest and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine interest.</v>

84
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking is in face and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>female interest,</v>

85
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:28.550
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking is in people and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what underlies the differences say in,</v>

86
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in career choice preference between </v>

87
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.241
<v Speaker 1>things like nursing and psychology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>social work and that sort of thing and </v>

88
00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:37.290
<v Speaker 1>engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

89
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.530
<v Speaker 1>because engineering is perhaps the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>male oriented about the disciplines and </v>

90
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.570
<v Speaker 1>the evidence that that's a sociological </v>
<v Speaker 1>is very,</v>

91
00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>very unique.</v>
