1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.840
<v Speaker 1>One of the Kennedy's genius boys came up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the cars,</v>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy's administration was run by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of Harvard graduates and Ivy League </v>

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.960
<v Speaker 1>graduates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were supposed to be pretty </v>

5
00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:15.081
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but intelligence and wisdom are not the </v>

6
00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:15.081
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

7
00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:19.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they established a policy which was </v>

8
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>called mutual assured destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means if you hit me,</v>

9
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:25.521
<v Speaker 1>I kill you and then you kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it'd be better if we just didn't </v>

10
00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>bother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the acronym was mad,</v>

11
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mutual assured destruction.</v>

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>just thinking about that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a chilling thought.</v>

14
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like what horrible entity thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>that up as a joke.</v>

15
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think,</v>

16
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that sum.</v>

17
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>It says that some politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ib of width,</v>

18
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.360
<v Speaker 1>like where'd that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a hell of a thing to make a </v>

19
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.360
<v Speaker 1>joke about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>mad.</v>

21
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Well that was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely mad,</v>

22
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.400
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

23
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the odd thing is,</v>

24
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>is that we didn't blow ourselves up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have a third World War.</v>

25
00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

26
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.250
<v Speaker 1>you can't make a solid claim that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>invention of nuclear weapons was </v>

27
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>necessarily the worst thing that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have happened,</v>

28
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because even the Soviets who were </v>

29
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.111
<v Speaker 1>completely insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course the model was to probably </v>

30
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:15.411
<v Speaker 1>even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't insane enough to start a </v>

31
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>nuclear war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now style it,</v>

32
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>there's evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is debate about it,</v>

33
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>but there was an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's evidence that Stalin was </v>

34
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>basically murdered partly by cruise </v>
<v Speaker 1>ship,</v>

35
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>was who was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was his successor when Stalin died,</v>

36
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Khrushchev and three other people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his house and what happened in </v>

37
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Stalin's house the night he died is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear,</v>

38
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>but I read a book recently called </v>
<v Speaker 1>stolen.</v>

39
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was written by a guy who had access</v>

40
00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>to the full communist party archives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was relatively new thing.</v>

41
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.160
<v Speaker 1>And that was his conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also believed that Stalin was </v>

42
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>gearing up to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an invasion of Europe and that he didn't</v>

43
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:55.390
<v Speaker 1>give a damn how many cities would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be bombed in order for the Soviets to</v>

44
00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>rule through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Stalin.</v>

45
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>He was like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Stalin was perfectly capable of taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire nations of people out in eastern </v>

47
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Europe by train and shipping them out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Siberia in the middle of the winter with</v>

48
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>nothing to eat and no tools and letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them live,</v>

49
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>which of course they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that meant women,</v>

50
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

51
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shorn of all their belongings and thrust</v>

52
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:18.830
<v Speaker 1>out into the middle of nowhere to perish</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

53
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or live as they saw fit and if they </v>

54
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.361
<v Speaker 1>perished so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better as far as Stalin was </v>

55
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:26.361
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

56
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>And so he wasn't exactly the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

57
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a nuclear war would </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily stop.</v>

58
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly possible that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was hoping for.</v>

59
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when we look at people like </v>

60
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Stalin and Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think,</v>

61
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>thereafter world domination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:45.381
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in some sense that's kind of a </v>

64
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:45.381
<v Speaker 1>positive motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really,</v>

66
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's like if you have a corvette say</v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone steals it,</v>

67
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I know why they stole it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to have the corvette.</v>

69
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

70
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>it's an understandable motivation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>want power.</v>

71
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily an admirable one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes power is a perfectly </v>

72
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.881
<v Speaker 1>reasonable thing to pursue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have any idea why we ever </v>

73
00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>assume that those guys were after </v>
<v Speaker 1>victory.</v>

74
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Like you should never make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that everyone is out to </v>

75
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>when some people are out to lose and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>more people they can take with them,</v>

76
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>

77
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when Hitler died,</v>

78
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>he committed suicide in a bunker way </v>
<v Speaker 1>down below Berlin.</v>

79
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>West Berlin was on fire and Europe was </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning.</v>

80
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

81
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>that was exactly what Hitler was after </v>
<v Speaker 1>right from the beginning.</v>

82
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was interested in fire as a purifying</v>

83
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:31.850
<v Speaker 1>agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

84
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.870
<v Speaker 1>he's a fire worship or in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you look at the Nuremberg </v>

85
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>gatherings of the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>they're spectacular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular celebrations,</v>

87
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.480
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably dramatic and impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they frequently featured fire and </v>

88
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>fire's up purifying agent know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hitler,</v>

89
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:53.311
<v Speaker 1>by the end of World War Two was he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty contemptuous of the Germans </v>

90
00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>because they really hadn't served him </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

91
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>That it wasn't like he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe it wasn't such a good idea to</v>

92
00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:00.530
<v Speaker 1>start a whole second world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>because he was a little on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic side we might say,</v>

94
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>but by the time the Russians came </v>
<v Speaker 1>marching in Germany was in ruins.</v>

95
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Hitler was perfectly happy to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>allies tromp all over the citizens </v>

96
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>because that's what they deserved </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

97
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.600
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the sort of guy he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so why we would assume that he </v>

98
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>wanted to win just because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he said is something I'd never been able</v>

99
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 1>to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

100
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>the kids who shot up columbine didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to win.</v>

101
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to kill as many people as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to make a point and then they </v>

102
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 1>wanted to kill themselves just in case </v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't exactly get the point.</v>

103
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.100
<v Speaker 1>And the point was the more destruction </v>
<v Speaker 1>the battery and if I have to go along </v>

104
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.100
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

105
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.360
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just makes me a little bit more </v>

106
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.491
<v Speaker 1>serious than I might've otherwise be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those sorts of motivations are </v>

107
00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:48.691
<v Speaker 1>not pleasant to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have enough documentation about </v>

108
00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:49.900
<v Speaker 1>events like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.400
<v Speaker 1>especially the mass killings.</v>

110
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Those guys have written down exactly why</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it.</v>

111
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some excellent books on </v>

112
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary vengeful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a map serial killers that mass murders.</v>

113
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:05.851
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly how they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a great book if you're </v>

114
00:05:05.851 --> 00:05:05.851
<v Speaker 1>interested in this sort of thing called </v>
<v Speaker 1>pans,</v>

115
00:05:05.851 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Ram p a n Zed r a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>m and Carl Pants.</v>

116
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:15.061
<v Speaker 1>Ram was a serial killer and rapist who </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived pretty much early in the 20th </v>

117
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:17.380
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was a tough delinquency sorta kid</v>

118
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 1>from a large family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he was,</v>

119
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>

120
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sent them off to some reform school</v>

121
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:28.351
<v Speaker 1>and it was really run by the same sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people that run Canada's residential </v>

122
00:05:28.351 --> 00:05:31.981
<v Speaker 1>schools and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those were basically predators on </v>

123
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:32.860
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course he was raped and,</v>

124
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.030
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

125
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 1>and brutalized and tormented and in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of horrible ways.</v>

126
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:39.790
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a tough guy.</v>

127
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 1>And when he came out he decided that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 1>the human race really wasn't worth that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

129
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 1>And that he was going to reek as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayhem as he possibly could for the rest</v>

130
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He raped a thousand men.</v>

131
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 1>He killed dozens of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kept track of the dollar value of the</v>

132
00:05:55.121 --> 00:06:00.121
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He burned down like this was a serious </v>

133
00:06:00.121 --> 00:06:03.371
<v Speaker 1>guy and he wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was bent on destruction and that's </v>

134
00:06:03.371 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>that when he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were his dying words?</v>

135
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a committee,</v>

136
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of women who intervened on behalf of him</v>

137
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 1>because they were anti capital </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

138
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 1>And he said to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

139
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:22.601
<v Speaker 1>that he wished the human race had one </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck so that he could put his hands </v>

140
00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>around it and squeeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

141
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:27.941
<v Speaker 1>that was his way of pointing out to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who didn't think that maybe </v>

142
00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:31.990
<v Speaker 1>capital punishment was justified in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>case that maybe they weren't thinking </v>

143
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to the hang man,</v>

144
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurry up you who's your bastard?</v>

145
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 1>I could kill 10 men in the time it takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to hang me.</v>

146
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get a statement like that from</v>

147
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 1>someone who isn't thoroughly committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to what he's doing.</v>
