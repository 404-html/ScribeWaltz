00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you have problems in your life that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not addressing that you could </v>

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.180
<v Speaker 1>solve and answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's an easy thing to figure out.</v>

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>You sit on your bed one morning and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.220
<v Speaker 1>there's some things that need to be done</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I don't want to do that I could do </v>

5
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 1>that would make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the end of the day,</v>

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>what are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:24.591
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your conscience will deliver those </v>

8
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>suckers no time flat now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you might have to say,</v>

9
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how do I entice myself into doing a</v>

10
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:32.841
<v Speaker 1>few of those and if you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of trying to force yourself to </v>

11
00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>do it like you're a tyrant and a slave </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

12
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>you can usually negotiate with yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you'll start to sort those </v>

13
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>things out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort them out,</v>

14
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>put your house in order and then move </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

15
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Move on and out.</v>

16
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a freudian slip by the way.</v>

17
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's important because the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a practice domain,</v>

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

19
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 1>there are things that are within your </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasp that you could fix.</v>

20
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Fix them and you'll learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll learn because it's harder than it</v>

21
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:12.351
<v Speaker 1>looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fix them and you'll learn how to fix </v>

22
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>things and then something else will </v>
<v Speaker 1>beckon as another problem that you could</v>

23
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>fix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>you all have your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

25
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Like there's an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems in the world.</v>

26
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Some of them happened to be yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

27
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have your problems.</v>

28
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solve them.</v>

29
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I learned as a </v>

30
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.771
<v Speaker 1>therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every therapist has to learn this </v>

31
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you wonder </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're first starting to be a </v>

32
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.681
<v Speaker 1>clinician is how do you not take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes of your client's home with </v>

33
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:39.681
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

34
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>immoral to.</v>

35
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Speaker 1>They're not your problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

36
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>their problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like their,</v>

37
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>

38
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your problems are your life.</v>

39
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to solve someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems for them because you take away </v>

40
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.631
<v Speaker 1>the deep meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's to be found in having them work </v>

41
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>through the problems on their own and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you steal the credit.</v>

42
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can help you with that.</v>

43
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

44
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

45
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>but I don't help you with the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

46
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in any case,</v>

47
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>you sort sort out the problems that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>right in front of you and you will.</v>

48
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 1>It will make you grow very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly and then you'll be able to </v>

49
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>sort out more complex problems without </v>
<v Speaker 1>making them worse.</v>
