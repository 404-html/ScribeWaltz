1
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Another taboo is to celebrate European </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Multiculturalists get pretty unhappy </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Europeans start expressing pride in</v>

3
00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:15.220
<v Speaker 1>their culture or heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many especially on the left,</v>

4
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>do not draw much of a distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in practice between European </v>

5
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.781
<v Speaker 1>pride and white supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You care about freedom of the </v>

6
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual's freedom to think,</v>

7
00:00:26.951 --> 00:00:29.200
<v Speaker 1>to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to associate in short,</v>

8
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.680
<v Speaker 1>to act as he sees fit without external </v>
<v Speaker 1>compulsion,</v>

9
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>as long as he doesn't infringe on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar liberties of others.</v>

10
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Professor Ricardo do a historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociologists and professor at the </v>

11
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 1>University of New Brunswick argues that </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

12
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.670
<v Speaker 1>individualism is a unique attribute of </v>
<v Speaker 1>European peoples.</v>

13
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has been exported to some degree to </v>

14
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>other nations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in my view,</v>

15
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.620
<v Speaker 1>it is not something that comes to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally,</v>

16
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>so he continues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quote,</v>

17
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.100
<v Speaker 1>you can't play the game of we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>

18
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>We have to affirm and be proud of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic identity and heritage to preserve</v>

19
00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:14.011
<v Speaker 1>the West's curious individualism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Europeans have become minorities in </v>

20
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 1>the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he argues the founding idea of the West,</v>

21
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>that no entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not an individual,</v>

22
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 1>not a community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the state congested.</v>

23
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.690
<v Speaker 1>We deprive an individual of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>

24
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:28.960
<v Speaker 1>or property by force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what the individual's race,</v>

25
00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>class or religion.</v>

26
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised if Dushane when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he made this statement,</v>

27
00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:35.920
<v Speaker 1>had you in mind.</v>

28
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

29
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>medieval Europeans identified seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>deadly sins for reason and one of them </v>

30
00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:49.990
<v Speaker 1>was pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

31
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>let's make the presumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that for for reasons that </v>

32
00:01:56.141 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>aren't obvious that the west has got </v>
<v Speaker 1>some things right.</v>

33
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.250
<v Speaker 1>We've got the sovereignty of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

34
00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:08.251
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most fundamental thing we've </v>

35
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:08.251
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

36
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:09.910
<v Speaker 1>We've articulated that I think in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a remarkable way,</v>

37
00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:14.911
<v Speaker 1>not only theologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophically in her body of laws and </v>

38
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:19.891
<v Speaker 1>our societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the consequences of that as </v>

39
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:22.360
<v Speaker 1>it's had its effect on the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is that everyone is getting richer</v>

40
00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:24.790
<v Speaker 1>quite fast and that's a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

41
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having said that,</v>

42
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:28.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I proud of that?</v>

43
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do that.</v>

44
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.370
<v Speaker 1>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pride.</v>

45
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.330
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the right response.</v>

46
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.270
<v Speaker 1>How about responsibility for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would that be?</v>

47
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is great.</v>

48
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

49
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>and unlikely set of propositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this strange set of propositions that </v>

50
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.811
<v Speaker 1>says that in some ineffable manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poorest person is as valuable as the</v>

51
00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.030
<v Speaker 1>king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

52
00:02:58.031 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>how the hell did we ever figure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>

53
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 1>That's an impossible thing to think and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet that's the.</v>

54
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the bedrock of our legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing to be proud of.</v>

55
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.180
<v Speaker 1>That's something to tremble before to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take on as an ethical burden and not to </v>

56
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:18.031
<v Speaker 1>wave a flag for how wonderful you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you happen to have the same skin </v>

57
00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>color as some of the people who thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>that up.</v>

58
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's open your eyes and </v>

59
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.831
<v Speaker 1>recognize that as a miracle and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively relatively new miracle on the</v>

60
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:34.501
<v Speaker 1>world stage and to and to participate in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process of upholding that in your </v>

61
00:03:34.501 --> 00:03:38.940
<v Speaker 1>personal and your public life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not pride in European tradition.</v>

62
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Like when I go to Europe and I love </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to Europe and the European cities </v>

63
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.971
<v Speaker 1>are there unbelievable masterpieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why they're completely flooded </v>

64
00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>by pilgrims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Tourists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pilgrims who go there to look at the </v>

66
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 1>beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't feel pride about that.</v>

67
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I have something to live up </v>

68
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>to that's not the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

69
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>and so these right wingers in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

70
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>look what we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

71
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not you that did that.</v>

72
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.990
<v Speaker 1>That's something mad you gotta you gotTa</v>
<v Speaker 1>have your act together before you would </v>

73
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:12.990
<v Speaker 1>dare to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

74
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>that was me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

75
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

76
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>sure it was you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

77
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

78
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to stand up and take your </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in that,</v>

79
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>in that kind of historical process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that unlikely,</v>

80
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:30.241
<v Speaker 1>miraculous historical process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to just feel ashamed at the way that</v>

81
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:35.281
<v Speaker 1>you're presently constituted in the face</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that means that you're diluted and </v>

82
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.860
<v Speaker 1>you're using your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your your great fortune of being a </v>

83
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>beneficiary of that system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at what we've got here,</v>

84
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>this great pace that we're inhabiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

85
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.800
<v Speaker 1>You're using your unearned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unearned gift that's been granted to</v>

86
00:04:56.051 --> 00:05:01.051
<v Speaker 1>you as a source of personal pride in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your accomplishments do to your skin.</v>

87
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

88
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.160
<v Speaker 1>not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a good argument.</v>

89
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.910
<v Speaker 1>So and that doesn't mean that while </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing valuable about European </v>

90
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty.</v>

91
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.870
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty about it that's value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even so clear to what degree </v>

92
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>it's European.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it came out of the Middle East,</v>

93
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:24.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean who it's so muddle headed that you </v>

94
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 1>hardly know where to start.</v>
