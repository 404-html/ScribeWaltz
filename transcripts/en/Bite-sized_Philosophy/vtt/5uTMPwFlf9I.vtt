00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the decomposition of the,</v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.890
<v Speaker 1>of the fundamental archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dragon of chaos differentiates on </v>

3
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>the one hand into the feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the unknown,</v>

4
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:16.281
<v Speaker 1>and the feminine differentiates further </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the negative feminine than the </v>

5
00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Positive Feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The negative feminine is the reason for </v>

6
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.140
<v Speaker 1>which haunts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the reason for,</v>

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole group online called men </v>
<v Speaker 1>going their own way.</v>

9
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.420
<v Speaker 1>M,</v>
<v Speaker 1>g,</v>

10
00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>T,</v>
<v Speaker 1>O w,</v>

11
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>that's a very interesting group to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>

12
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.110
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of them there are,</v>

13
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>and most of them are older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them are men who've been through</v>

14
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>a particularly horrifying divorce for </v>
<v Speaker 1>one reason or another,</v>

15
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>and there they've had enough of women so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stay.</v>

16
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:50.121
<v Speaker 1>Tell that young men that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching never have a permanent </v>

17
00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never share your territory with a woman,</v>

18
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>never share your possessions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you never lived together and </v>

19
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.651
<v Speaker 1>don't stay with one long enough to enter</v>
<v Speaker 1>a common law relationship because you </v>

20
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>will be stripped of everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

21
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a thing to be telling </v>

22
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.571
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's happened is that the female </v>

23
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:11.091
<v Speaker 1>has been manifested in their life only </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the negative archetype and they've </v>

24
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>got that confused with all women and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly,</v>

25
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta ask yourself if you know the </v>

26
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.620
<v Speaker 1>mythological stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you made the right sacrifices,</v>

27
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have so much trouble with </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

28
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question to ask yourself </v>

29
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.460
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would also say,</v>

30
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a woman who has trouble with </v>

31
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>man or you're a man who has trouble with</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

32
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not the women and it's not the man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you because the women are telling </v>

33
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:40.311
<v Speaker 1>you what's wrong with you and the men </v>
<v Speaker 1>are telling you what's wrong with you </v>

34
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't listen then it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's either you are all men.</v>

35
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Well that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all men.</v>

36
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>While that's certainly how it's played </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the world right now,</v>

37
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

38
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>it's not all men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be by definition,</v>

39
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 1>by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not all women.</v>

40
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have anything to do with</v>

41
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a pathetic weasel.</v>

42
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the same statement.</v>
