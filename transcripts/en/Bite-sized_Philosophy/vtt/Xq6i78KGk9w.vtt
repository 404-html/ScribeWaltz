1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Borders are reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

2
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.020
<v Speaker 1>The law is the border that stops someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>from stealing your</v>

3
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's an apple laptop,</v>

4
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:27.501
<v Speaker 1>what's the sort of laptop that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warrior would carry and </v>

5
00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>then the social justice warrior is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be very irritated if you happen to </v>

6
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 1>purloin their laptop and then you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>point out to them,</v>

7
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:38.031
<v Speaker 1>you know it's a border that protects you</v>
<v Speaker 1>from having that thing taken and they </v>

8
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

9
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>the borders should be open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay man,</v>

10
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:45.561
<v Speaker 1>no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you hand over that laptop right now </v>

11
00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:47.870
<v Speaker 1>and everything else you own too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like borders and you can </v>

12
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>get rid of the damn walls in your house </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't need doors on your bedroom</v>

13
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:53.601
<v Speaker 1>either and we can keep an eye on you </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever we want and so much for </v>

14
00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:57.171
<v Speaker 1>borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that really differs </v>

15
00:00:57.171 --> 00:00:59.421
<v Speaker 1>between liberals and conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the left and the right is the </v>

16
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>right is in the right legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tight borders between things.</v>

17
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>It's part of being conscientious at </v>
<v Speaker 1>every level,</v>

18
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>conceptually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually,</v>

19
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>familiarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provincially,</v>

20
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>nationally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The right says,</v>

21
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's keep.</v>

22
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep the borders between things </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty distinct and the left says,</v>

23
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not because some of those borders </v>

24
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.031
<v Speaker 1>are in the wrong place and a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more free flow of information wouldn't </v>

25
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>be a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is that right,</v>

26
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 1>but so are the Conservatives and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>why you have to talk.</v>

27
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>we've got some borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing.</v>

29
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some of them need to be moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>around a little bit and that's what the </v>

30
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.611
<v Speaker 1>political dialogue is for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that borders </v>

31
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:37.971
<v Speaker 1>themselves are a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a great idea because without </v>

32
00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:41.961
<v Speaker 1>borders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything Nash's into the same </v>

33
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:43.890
<v Speaker 1>untenable state of undifferentiated </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and you can't live in that.</v>

34
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>And so the people who are trying to tear</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the borders conceptually,</v>

35
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:52.641
<v Speaker 1>politically and practically what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want is the chaos that that would bring </v>

36
00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>the either want that or they're too </v>
<v Speaker 1>foolish to know that their pursuits will</v>

37
00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>produce that.</v>

38
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

39
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>let's be a little bit clear that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up and say,</v>

40
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>borders,</v>

41
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>they're okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got their problems,</v>

42
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:08.901
<v Speaker 1>but they're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make you a bigot beyond </v>

43
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:13.251
<v Speaker 1>redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes you someone with some </v>

44
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:16.341
<v Speaker 1>sense and it's actually okay to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone with some sense limits on </v>

45
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>immigration are also reasonable while we</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to figure out what those limits are</v>

46
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the bloody political </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue is for,</v>

47
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that it should be limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some degree is also reasonable.</v>

48
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:30.891
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not just open the borders and let </v>

49
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:30.891
<v Speaker 1>everybody come in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:34.941
<v Speaker 1>the reason you don't do that is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>a complex system cannot tolerate </v>

51
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>extensive transformation over too short </v>
<v Speaker 1>a period of time.</v>

52
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Now you want immigrants to come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're the sorts of </v>

53
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.531
<v Speaker 1>immigrants who are likely to contribute </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly to the success of your policy </v>

54
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>and lots of immigrants do that.</v>

55
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the vast majority,</v>

56
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:56.811
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of entrepreneurs in the United States </v>

57
00:02:56.811 --> 00:02:56.811
<v Speaker 1>come from the Indian subcontinent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so great.</v>

58
00:02:56.811 --> 00:02:57.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring them over.</v>

59
00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>They're highly educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're extraordinarily productive.</v>

60
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>They make lots of new businesses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they pump money like back,</v>

61
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>like mad back in India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good deal.</v>

62
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.250
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have our arms are open to everyone </v>

63
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>immigration policy because it's complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubbish.</v>

64
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>All that means is you're not thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

65
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>so when here's the coded to that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>

66
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Here's something I've been thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this a lot lately.</v>

67
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.860
<v Speaker 1>It should not be assumed that citizens </v>
<v Speaker 1>have societies that have not evolved </v>

68
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.170
<v Speaker 1>functional individual rights predicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>polities will hold values in keeping </v>

69
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>with such qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could say,</v>

70
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:38.161
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of countries in the </v>

71
00:03:38.331 --> 00:03:41.660
<v Speaker 1>world that are not governed well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of them,</v>

72
00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:46.661
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've been not governed well </v>

73
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to me that means that there's </v>

74
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.971
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with the values that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>held collectively by the people who've </v>

75
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:53.540
<v Speaker 1>established those policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be naive and assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>merely because you moved them to a new </v>

77
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.411
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to let their innate </v>

78
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:02.411
<v Speaker 1>democratic longings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>

79
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.780
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work that way.</v>
