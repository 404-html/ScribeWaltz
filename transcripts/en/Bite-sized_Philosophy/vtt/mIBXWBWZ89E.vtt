00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.300
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is what the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creation stories in genesis,</v>

2
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually need because they actually mean</v>

3
00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:11.220
<v Speaker 1>something and what they mean is </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely remarkable in my estimation.</v>

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.460
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to tell you a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit about that story because it's </v>

5
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:21.531
<v Speaker 1>necessary to understand what the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>means to determine if what Nisha said </v>

6
00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:25.221
<v Speaker 1>about the inevitable destruction of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic religious structures by science</v>

7
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>was inevitable and necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the answer to that is no.</v>

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.850
<v Speaker 1>We just didn't understand what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were doing any more than we really </v>

9
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>understand why we put up Christmas trees</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Christmas.</v>

10
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker 1>So we do that in part because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christmas tree is a symbol of life </v>

11
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.531
<v Speaker 1>because the tree is a symbol of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we inhabited trees for untold </v>

12
00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:49.431
<v Speaker 1>millions of years and we put lights on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trees to symbolize the coming back </v>

13
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>into the darkness of Midwinter of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sun and the light.</v>

14
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>And so we play this symbolic game that </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrates both life and the emergence </v>

15
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.781
<v Speaker 1>of light and consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we associate that with the birth of </v>

16
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>the savior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we don't know that we're doing that.</v>

17
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.180
<v Speaker 1>But we do it anyways so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we do that sort of thing all the </v>

18
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.851
<v Speaker 1>time because we're smarter than we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that has to be the case because we </v>

19
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:14.661
<v Speaker 1>don't know ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would need a psychology or sociology </v>

20
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 1>and anthropology or any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we were transparent to ourselves.</v>

21
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.230
<v Speaker 1>We're machines so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are far more intelligent and wise.</v>

22
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Then the machines themselves can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and we've reveal ourselves to</v>

23
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>our action and our symbolic gestures </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>

25
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>And then have to reflect on that to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand what it is that we're up </v>

26
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
