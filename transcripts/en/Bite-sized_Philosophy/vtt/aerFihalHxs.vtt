1
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we should first decide what we're </v>

2
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:13.881
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about my views of </v>

3
00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:17.631
<v Speaker 1>political correctness despite what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have inferred from the last </v>

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.850
<v Speaker 1>speaker's comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how it looks to me.</v>

5
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.930
<v Speaker 1>We essentially need something </v>
<v Speaker 1>approximating a low resolution grant </v>

6
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 1>narrative to unitus and and we did </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative tonight is because otherwise </v>

7
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.291
<v Speaker 1>we don't have peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's playing out in the universities </v>

8
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>and in broader society right now is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate between two fundamental low </v>

9
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.081
<v Speaker 1>resolution narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither of which can be completely </v>

10
00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>accurate because they can't encompass </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the details.</v>

11
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Obviously human beings have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual element and a collective </v>

12
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.420
<v Speaker 1>element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group element.</v>

13
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the question is what story </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be paramount,</v>

14
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>and this is how it looks to me in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>West.</v>

15
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>We have reasonably functional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably free,</v>

16
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.460
<v Speaker 1>remarkably productive stable hierarchies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are open to consideration of the </v>

17
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>dispossessed that hierarchies generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>create.</v>

18
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Our societies are freer and functioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>more effectively than any societies,</v>

19
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else in the world and that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then any societies ever have and as far </v>

20
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.341
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's good reason to </v>

21
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:30.561
<v Speaker 1>assume this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because the fundamental low </v>

22
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:32.841
<v Speaker 1>resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a grand narrative that we've oriented </v>

23
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:36.681
<v Speaker 1>ourselves around in the West is one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sovereignty of the individual and </v>

24
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated on the idea that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>things considered the best way for me to</v>

25
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:44.511
<v Speaker 1>interact with someone else's individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>to individual and to react to that </v>

26
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:48.501
<v Speaker 1>person as if they're both part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process because that's the right way of </v>

27
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:53.931
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The psychological process by which </v>

28
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>things we don't understand can yet be </v>
<v Speaker 1>explored and buy.</v>

29
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Things that aren't properly organized in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our society can be yet set.</v>

30
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:03.201
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason we're valuable as </v>

31
00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:05.271
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both with regards to our rights and </v>

32
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because that's our essential purpose.</v>

33
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Announce our nobility and that's our </v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

34
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.150
<v Speaker 1>What's happening as far as I'm concerned</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the universities in particular and </v>

35
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>spreading very rapidly out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader world,</v>

36
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>including the corporate world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much to.</v>

37
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:22.161
<v Speaker 1>It's a much to what should be its </v>
<v Speaker 1>chagrin is a collectivist narrative and </v>

38
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:27.140
<v Speaker 1>of course there's some utility in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectivist narrative because we're all</v>

39
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.150
<v Speaker 1>part of groups in different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the collectivist narrative that I </v>

40
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.260
<v Speaker 1>regard as politically correct as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pastiche of a strange pastiche of </v>

41
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism in neo Marxism in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental claim is that no,</v>

42
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.200
<v Speaker 1>you're not essentially an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're essentially a member of a group </v>

43
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>and that group might be your ethnicity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it might be your sex and it might be</v>

44
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:54.261
<v Speaker 1>a race and it might be any of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>endless numbers of other potential </v>

45
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:58.251
<v Speaker 1>groups that you belong to because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>belong to many of them and that you </v>

46
00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>should be essentially categorized with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who are like you on that dimension</v>

47
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>in that group.</v>

48
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.870
<v Speaker 1>That's proposition number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Proposition number two is that the </v>

49
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.171
<v Speaker 1>proper way to view the world is as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>battleground between groups of different</v>

50
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:15.211
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you define the groups first and then </v>

51
00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:15.211
<v Speaker 1>you assume that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

52
00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>you view the individual from the group </v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

53
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:22.201
<v Speaker 1>You viewed the battle between groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the group context and you view </v>

54
00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:25.771
<v Speaker 1>history itself as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but the power maneuvers between </v>

55
00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>different groups that eliminates any </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration of the individual and at a</v>

56
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>very fundamental level and also any </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

57
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:38.341
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of free speech because if you're </v>

58
00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>collectivist at heart in this manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no such thing as free speech.</v>

59
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.540
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that it's debated by those on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical left and let's say the rest </v>

60
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>of us so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that in that formulation there's no</v>

61
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:52.891
<v Speaker 1>such thing as free speech because for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individualist free speech is how you </v>

62
00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 1>make sense of the world and reorganize </v>
<v Speaker 1>society in a proper manner,</v>

63
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>but for the radical left type </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectivist that's associated with this</v>

64
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint of political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you speak,</v>

65
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.210
<v Speaker 1>all you're doing is playing a power game</v>
<v Speaker 1>on behalf of your group and there's </v>

66
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>nothing else that you can do because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all there is and not only is that</v>

67
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>all there is in terms of who you are as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an individual now and how society should</v>

68
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>be viewed.</v>

69
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 1>It's also the fundamental narrative of </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

70
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's widely assumed in our universities </v>

71
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>now that the best way to conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 1>Western civilization is as an oppressive</v>

72
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>male dominated patriarchy and that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best way to construe relationships </v>

73
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.691
<v Speaker 1>between men and women across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries is one of oppression of women </v>

74
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>by men as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

75
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 1>no hierarchy is without it's tyranny </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

76
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.100
<v Speaker 1>That's an axiomatic truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have recognized that literally </v>

77
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.891
<v Speaker 1>for thousands of years and hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 1>do tend towards tyranny and they tend </v>

78
00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:51.750
<v Speaker 1>towards the use of patient by people </v>
<v Speaker 1>with power,</v>

79
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.870
<v Speaker 1>but that only happens when they become </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and we have mechanisms in our </v>

80
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.920
<v Speaker 1>society to stop hierarchies from </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming intolerable,</v>

81
00:04:58.921 --> 00:05:02.700
<v Speaker 1>be corrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually work pretty well and so and so.</v>

82
00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I would also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also.</v>

83
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I would also point this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.170
<v Speaker 1>don't be thinking that this is a debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>about whether empathy is useful or not </v>

85
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.430
<v Speaker 1>or that the people on the con side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument are not empathetic.</v>

86
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I know perfectly well as I insured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Frye does that.</v>

87
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Hierarchies tend to produce situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people stack up at the bottom and </v>

88
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.780
<v Speaker 1>that the dispossessed and hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 1>need a political voice,</v>

89
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>which is the proper voice of the left by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

90
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:31.681
<v Speaker 1>and the necessary voice of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is not the same as proclaiming </v>

91
00:05:31.681 --> 00:05:35.931
<v Speaker 1>that the right level of analysis for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>grand unifying narrative is that all of </v>

92
00:05:35.931 --> 00:05:40.371
<v Speaker 1>us are fundamentally to be identified by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the groups that we belong to and to </v>

93
00:05:40.371 --> 00:05:45.261
<v Speaker 1>construe the entire world as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battleground between different forms of </v>

94
00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:49.791
<v Speaker 1>tyranny in consequence of that group </v>
<v Speaker 1>affiliation and to the degree that we </v>

95
00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:52.410
<v Speaker 1>play out that narrative that won't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

96
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:57.411
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we certainly haven't seen that </v>

97
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:58.350
<v Speaker 1>progress in the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've seen situations like what happened</v>

98
00:05:58.351 --> 00:06:00.510
<v Speaker 1>at Wilfrid laurier university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

99
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 1>we won't see progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will return to is exactly the same </v>

100
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.120
<v Speaker 1>kind of tribalism to characterize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

101
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
