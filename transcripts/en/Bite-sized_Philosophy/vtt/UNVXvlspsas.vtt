1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first one I say,</v>

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.710
<v Speaker 1>from my understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the essential problems with epistemology</v>

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.980
<v Speaker 1>derive from the nature of language and </v>
<v Speaker 1>axioms upon which various underlying </v>

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.380
<v Speaker 1>linguistic structures are based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then afterwards interpreted,</v>

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>as you have said in your videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you construe some </v>

6
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>of the same definitions of insert random</v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>person says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the same way are virtually zero,</v>

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.040
<v Speaker 1>or one of the best examples I can give </v>
<v Speaker 1>for this is the language that is used in</v>

9
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:35.061
<v Speaker 1>physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is widely misconstrued as the </v>

10
00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:38.811
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic meanings behind words and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their contexts are worlds debased from </v>

11
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>the vague linguistic constructed views </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the actual linguistic,</v>

12
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitions that people construe so,</v>

13
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>such as the problem with the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>

14
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>dimension in which it is understood in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the semantic sense,</v>

15
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:53.630
<v Speaker 1>but not in an abstract sense in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>the word is implied.</v>

16
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>The first chapter of Einstein's theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>of special and general relativity,</v>

17
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Einstein stresses that geometry is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract model.</v>

18
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Time per se is not the dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theory of special relativity merely </v>

19
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>treats any one clock time as dimension </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an abstract construct.</v>

20
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.500
<v Speaker 1>So for the next three questions I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want this to be considered as a means </v>

21
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

22
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.290
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

23
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 2>so my answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally I think the best answer to</v>

24
00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:26.531
<v Speaker 2>that was provided by the American </v>
<v Speaker 2>pragmatists and that'd be William James </v>

25
00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:30.191
<v Speaker 2>and his crew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would include guiding her pierce P </v>

26
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I e R,</v>
<v Speaker 2>c e m who was perhaps the,</v>

27
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best floors for the American,</v>

28
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 2>the US ever produced cns pierce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somewhat under appreciated and </v>

29
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Speaker 2>certainly so in his own life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the way that different people </v>

30
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.330
<v Speaker 2>hone in on the same definition is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>define what an acceptable outcome would </v>

31
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:58.721
<v Speaker 2>be to their joint interactions and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hone their language until they </v>

32
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:01.460
<v Speaker 2>achieve that outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then to consider that good enough.</v>

33
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.450
<v Speaker 2>I would say pearson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his crew basically said that you could </v>

34
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.450
<v Speaker 2>never do anything better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say that we're trying to.</v>

35
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Let's say we're trying to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how we're going to move a </v>

36
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 2>wheelbarrow full of bricks from one side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the yard to the other.</v>

37
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically what we've decided is we've </v>

38
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 2>communicated good enough if the bricks </v>
<v Speaker 2>get moved.</v>

39
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what you have to do is you have to </v>

40
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.121
<v Speaker 2>set up a practical surround in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense around your conversation and the </v>

41
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.870
<v Speaker 2>practical surround constitutes what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are willing to consider as proof that </v>

42
00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 2>conversation or that communication has </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken place sufficiently.</v>

43
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's partly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated and it's partly why the</v>

44
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.940
<v Speaker 2>robotics engineers tried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Rodney Brooks were discovered back </v>

45
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.541
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 eighties that you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't have intelligent machines </v>

46
00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:02.201
<v Speaker 2>without embodiment because you need a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real world target against which to </v>

47
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 2>measure the effectiveness of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>

48
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Because as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is where the postmodern is </v>

49
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 2>to have it right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there is a lot of different ways</v>

50
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:17.701
<v Speaker 2>of interpreting everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you know when your </v>

51
00:03:17.701 --> 00:03:20.191
<v Speaker 2>interpretation is good enough?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is you agree a </v>

52
00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 2>priority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would constitute good enough?</v>

53
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 2>And when you hit that target,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're done.</v>

54
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

55
00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:27.830
<v Speaker 1>And I'll look into CSPS.</v>

56
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cs Paris.</v>

57
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

58
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Look up the American pragmatists and go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to bright man.</v>

59
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so,</v>

60
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.290
<v Speaker 1>and then the next one is on </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgenderism and conservative.</v>

61
00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:47.291
<v Speaker 1>Strongly boast of biological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific claim of two genders or two </v>

62
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:48.440
<v Speaker 1>sexes based on what language we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use.</v>

63
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believe and I believe,</v>

64
00:03:50.211 --> 00:03:55.211
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully so in biological differences </v>

65
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:57.761
<v Speaker 1>between males and females,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never heard a liberal argue and</v>

66
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.550
<v Speaker 1>from my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I could partially combat this,</v>

67
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's an argument that hasn't been </v>
<v Speaker 1>raised from the liberal side,</v>

68
00:04:05.781 --> 00:04:07.610
<v Speaker 1>which I think should have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

69
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>biological differences in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women can see more shades of color on </v>

70
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.970
<v Speaker 1>average and men can have better spatial </v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation.</v>

71
00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>On average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Steven.</v>

72
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 2>There's massive neurological and </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological differences between women are</v>

73
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 2>well documented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the postmodernist types just assume </v>

74
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.701
<v Speaker 2>that the scientist who conducted the </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigations are suffering from the </v>

75
00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:30.920
<v Speaker 2>same bias that they think permeates </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

76
00:04:30.921 --> 00:04:32.030
<v Speaker 2>So they just discounted.</v>

77
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is it,</v>

78
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 1>is it really crazy to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone could be born with biological </v>

79
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.750
<v Speaker 1>similarities to an x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y,</v>

80
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.910
<v Speaker 1>brain and biological?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>

81
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>

82
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the argument that I'm making.</v>

83
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.640
<v Speaker 2>The argument I'm making is that gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity is strongly influenced by </v>

84
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 2>biological sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is is that the legislation,</v>

85
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 2>especially the legislation that's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced in Canada,</v>

86
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 2>argues that it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just not helpful.</v>

87
00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not even helpful for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgendered types because some of them</v>

88
00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:09.691
<v Speaker 2>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people who have mixed </v>

89
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:11.551
<v Speaker 2>biological sex women who have some cells</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their body that have male </v>

90
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 2>chromosomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trivial number for example,</v>

91
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:20.491
<v Speaker 2>and there are people who are born with </v>
<v Speaker 2>genitalia that are identifiable and </v>

92
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 2>there are more genuine hermaphroditic </v>
<v Speaker 2>types and there is no different,</v>

93
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:27.811
<v Speaker 2>no doubt that there are some men that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a more feminine personality </v>

94
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 2>structure in some women that have a more</v>
<v Speaker 2>masculine personality structure and then</v>

95
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 2>that's biologically influenced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would separate.</v>

96
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making a biological case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are two genders that end.</v>

97
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

98
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm making a biological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making a case that sexual identity </v>

99
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:51.991
<v Speaker 2>has been unbelievably powerfully </v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced by biology with certain </v>

100
00:05:51.991 --> 00:05:56.551
<v Speaker 2>exceptions and those exceptions </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves might be biologically </v>

101
00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:57.160
<v Speaker 2>determined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not In all cases but in many.</v>

102
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.650
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the reason I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>objecting to legislation like bill </v>

103
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.461
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] is because it insists that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender identity is socially constructed </v>

104
00:06:06.461 --> 00:06:11.290
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If gender identity is socially </v>

105
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.181
<v Speaker 2>constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why can't we just take transgender </v>

106
00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:13.181
<v Speaker 2>people and socialize them back into </v>
<v Speaker 2>their.</v>

107
00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Into their normative sex roles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

108
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

109
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of the reason I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>objecting to the legislation.</v>

110
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.000
<v Speaker 2>One of the most powerful arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said this,</v>

111
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 2>I did a presentation in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadian Senate.</v>

112
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw that or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason for you to have paid </v>

113
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.601
<v Speaker 2>attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look up Jordan Peterson and </v>

114
00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:37.691
<v Speaker 2>Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see that as well along with a </v>

115
00:06:37.691 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 2>professor along with a practicing </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyer.</v>

116
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.590
<v Speaker 2>I made exactly that case to a number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadian senators telling them that by </v>

117
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 2>supporting this legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were actually doing a disservice to</v>

118
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 2>the people that they purport to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>helping.</v>

119
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it,</v>

120
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 2>isn't that biologically there are two </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexes,</v>

121
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 2>although a pr as an approximation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

122
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 2>As a decent approximation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

123
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.840
<v Speaker 2>It gets slightly messy because we're our</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiplicity of ways than sexuality and </v>

124
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.600
<v Speaker 2>sex differences manifest themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those a fair bit of variability across </v>

125
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 2>all of those different manifestations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

126
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:19.150
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have feminine man and a </v>

127
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.181
<v Speaker 2>Masculine Male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>masculine woman that happens very </v>

128
00:07:21.181 --> 00:07:21.181
<v Speaker 2>frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

129
00:07:21.181 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 2>it's just more often you have a feminine</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman and a masculine man.</v>

130
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that perfectly explains my question.</v>

131
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So next postmodern is thought,</v>

132
00:07:31.741 --> 00:07:34.950
<v Speaker 1>and I think you kind of already talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

133
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you said the American postmodernist</v>

134
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 1>got this right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that I'm going to summarize very </v>

135
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.450
<v Speaker 1>quickly because you've already answered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

136
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say that you see scientific realism </v>

137
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:55.731
<v Speaker 1>is nested in Darwinian competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's reasonably objective that </v>

138
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

139
00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.320
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

140
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:03.330
<v Speaker 2>that's not quite right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that it isn't obvious to me </v>

141
00:08:03.451 --> 00:08:08.451
<v Speaker 2>that there is any truth that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is super ordinary to,</v>

142
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 2>to the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's established in the Darwinian </v>

143
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 2>fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that includes our notion of,</v>

144
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.350
<v Speaker 2>of objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's where Sam Harris and I had a </v>

145
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.820
<v Speaker 2>major disagreement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

146
00:08:20.821 --> 00:08:22.620
<v Speaker 2>it has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a consequence of,</v>

147
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:27.650
<v Speaker 2>of my pragmatic thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the Darwinian claim </v>

148
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.981
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally is that the only way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can come up with a definition of </v>

149
00:08:31.981 --> 00:08:35.931
<v Speaker 2>truth is throwing an evolutionary model </v>
<v Speaker 2>that uses death as the punishment being </v>

150
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things I was arguing </v>

151
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.621
<v Speaker 2>with with Sam Harris about is whether or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not our current conceptualizations of </v>

152
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:49.050
<v Speaker 2>objective truth are necessarily true in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Darwinian sense,</v>

153
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:54.230
<v Speaker 2>and if they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which form of truth should take </v>

154
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.781
<v Speaker 2>priority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was arguing the Darwinian truth </v>

155
00:08:56.781 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 2>should take priority and Sam was arguing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

156
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:03.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he didn't particularly like that </v>

157
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.820
<v Speaker 2>stamps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although one of the law.</v>

158
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 2>And that's basically what our argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what argument circulated around.</v>

159
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the problem is,</v>

160
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 2>see the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we never know.</v>

161
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the problem?</v>

162
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:21.171
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even our objective truth is seriously </v>

163
00:09:21.171 --> 00:09:22.440
<v Speaker 2>bounded in ways that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

164
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:28.310
<v Speaker 2>Claim claim it as at any given moment as</v>
<v Speaker 2>having some sort of fundamental </v>

165
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:33.441
<v Speaker 2>ontological status outside of it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian utility strikes me as </v>

166
00:09:33.441 --> 00:09:37.551
<v Speaker 2>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially given how trans mutable </v>

167
00:09:37.551 --> 00:09:37.551
<v Speaker 2>scientific theories tend to be.</v>

168
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.780
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to oversimplify things,</v>

169
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.740
<v Speaker 1>liberals tend to think with the anterior</v>
<v Speaker 1>cingulate cortex of the brain with </v>

170
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.800
<v Speaker 1>future applications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities,</v>

171
00:09:47.801 --> 00:09:52.801
<v Speaker 1>likeliness consequences in conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the brain that's involved in </v>

172
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:56.700
<v Speaker 1>social cognition name and conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to trust it.</v>

173
00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.200
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

174
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read what I wrote here.</v>

175
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:08.030
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low populations in rural areas would </v>

176
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 1>potentially possess more views of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>photometry,</v>

177
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:11.460
<v Speaker 1>working hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family values,</v>

178
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:13.500
<v Speaker 1>increasing population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting oneself,</v>

179
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.660
<v Speaker 1>and one's kind due to the types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations and the hypothalamus being </v>

180
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.251
<v Speaker 1>more applicable to survival while highly</v>
<v Speaker 1>populated areas would focus potentially </v>

181
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:25.440
<v Speaker 1>more on thinking tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>community values,</v>

182
00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 1>stabilizing population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but additionally might not focus so much</v>

183
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:33.801
<v Speaker 1>on protecting life or raising children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These differences could explain vastly </v>

184
00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:37.881
<v Speaker 1>the moral behaviors being ideally are </v>
<v Speaker 1>objectively true based on incalculable </v>

185
00:10:37.881 --> 00:10:37.920
<v Speaker 1>variables.</v>

186
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.360
<v Speaker 2>So a better run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Run that through me.</v>

187
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite complicated.</v>

188
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I am suggesting that if we are to </v>

189
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.130
<v Speaker 1>look at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reason why,</v>

190
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.270
<v Speaker 1>how people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can look at how people think as being</v>

191
00:10:56.271 --> 00:11:00.580
<v Speaker 1>nested in Darwinian competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

192
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.160
<v Speaker 1>so if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a low populated area you </v>

193
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:06.350
<v Speaker 1>would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

194
00:11:06.351 --> 00:11:10.900
<v Speaker 1>what traits incalculable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some somewhat telltale global trends</v>

195
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.940
<v Speaker 1>would be unnecessary for them to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>raised and what traits mostly in the </v>

196
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:20.411
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus I'm assuming and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>traits would be more applicable for a </v>

197
00:11:20.411 --> 00:11:25.001
<v Speaker 1>large city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost completely possible that </v>

198
00:11:25.001 --> 00:11:26.840
<v Speaker 1>the politics of liberals is perfect for </v>
<v Speaker 1>their situation in a big city,</v>

199
00:11:26.841 --> 00:11:29.060
<v Speaker 1>in the politics of conservatives as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

200
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.480
<v Speaker 2>this is one that you should think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

201
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.780
<v Speaker 2>it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a reasonable hypothesis.</v>

202
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.050
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to think it through a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

203
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.600
<v Speaker 2>before because you're suggesting that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative philosophy is more useful </v>

204
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:44.600
<v Speaker 2>in a.</v>

205
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low populated area.</v>

206
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

207
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.420
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

208
00:11:51.421 --> 00:11:53.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth thinking.</v>

209
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:58.630
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because I've been thinking about </v>

210
00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:58.630
<v Speaker 1>that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my main.</v>

211
00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 1>The main thing I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

212
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.930
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying necessarily directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

213
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.900
<v Speaker 1>but at least the possibility of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why</v>

214
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 2>one thing you could do just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to some degree to begin with is just run</v>

215
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:14.220
<v Speaker 2>a correlation between size of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community and,</v>

216
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:19.700
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and political proclivity you should go </v>

217
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.190
<v Speaker 2>get that data on the light online </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be approved because it might be</v>

218
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.820
<v Speaker 2>the more liberal types are also more </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to move to the cities,</v>

219
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this case you'd be leading </v>

220
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.191
<v Speaker 2>conservatives be hard and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're more well adopted by </v>

221
00:12:34.191 --> 00:12:39.051
<v Speaker 2>even then it might be because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>more well adapted into smaller </v>

222
00:12:39.051 --> 00:12:39.051
<v Speaker 2>communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good idea.</v>

223
00:12:39.051 --> 00:12:41.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's worth thinking about.</v>

224
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we actually have that data just </v>

225
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.571
<v Speaker 1>through political polls and you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you look at a map it's all red </v>

226
00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:53.560
<v Speaker 1>because the red is in the smaller areas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the blue looks small because it was </v>

227
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.690
<v Speaker 1>more people there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it does</v>

228
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.900
<v Speaker 2>tendon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a plausible hypothesis.</v>

229
00:12:57.901 --> 00:13:02.901
<v Speaker 2>It might be interesting to look in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>red states only and see if it's still </v>

230
00:13:02.901 --> 00:13:02.901
<v Speaker 2>true there.</v>

231
00:13:02.901 --> 00:13:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

232
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.780
<v Speaker 1>So thank you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

233
00:13:05.781 --> 00:13:07.070
<v Speaker 1>let that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

234
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.650
<v Speaker 1>think of that as a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one last question on religion,</v>

235
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.670
<v Speaker 1>and I've been watching your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

236
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:19.530
<v Speaker 1>your psychological interpretations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible as well as I have read the </v>

237
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.490
<v Speaker 1>maps of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

238
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.510
<v Speaker 1>so I may have missed something there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

239
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:30.180
<v Speaker 1>but this question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so neurophysiologically to my </v>

240
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.861
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the human brain is constructed </v>

241
00:13:34.861 --> 00:13:37.291
<v Speaker 1>is such that happiness is achieved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pursuit of a noble aim rather than </v>

242
00:13:37.481 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 1>the team of the goal itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've talked about this multiple times.</v>

243
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

244
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

245
00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.110
<v Speaker 2>it's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not happiness precisely,</v>

246
00:13:45.111 --> 00:13:50.111
<v Speaker 2>but that'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more like a sense of meaningful </v>

247
00:13:50.111 --> 00:13:50.111
<v Speaker 2>engagement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is better than happiness,</v>

248
00:13:50.111 --> 00:13:51.680
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can go with happiness for now.</v>

249
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.630
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

250
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.750
<v Speaker 1>if there's no noble aim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are limited to simple pleasures which</v>

251
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:56.670
<v Speaker 1>do not sustain sustainable.</v>

252
00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're limited to impulsive pleasures.</v>

253
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:05.191
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are ones that don't </v>

254
00:14:05.191 --> 00:14:05.191
<v Speaker 2>necessarily have a good medium to </v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm outcome.</v>

255
00:14:05.191 --> 00:14:10.120
<v Speaker 1>So if I am to take a psychological or </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of you or moral view of biblical </v>

256
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.290
<v Speaker 1>teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the scientific view,</v>

257
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

258
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.880
<v Speaker 1>am I right in construing that the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of external happiness without suffering </v>

259
00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:24.340
<v Speaker 1>exists as a brilliantly thought out </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct which invokes a sense of </v>

260
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.180
<v Speaker 1>purpose and happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I am to make that conclusion,</v>

261
00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Speaker 1>can I see those concepts in the moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology of the Bible as manipulative </v>

262
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.970
<v Speaker 1>or does the defiance of natural law rule</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a literal interpretation?</v>

263
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back.</v>

264
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Read that again.</v>

265
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.290
<v Speaker 1>So if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm to assume all of this with heaven</v>

266
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:49.291
<v Speaker 1>and hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is it an eternal happiness is </v>

267
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.960
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you see that as manipulative as like</v>

268
00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean certainly marks did.</v>

269
00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.150
<v Speaker 2>I would say Freud did as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the problem,</v>

270
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.140
<v Speaker 2>because for the thought of a religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

271
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.920
<v Speaker 2>let's call it both manipulated the vim </v>
<v Speaker 2>and immature because it burned people </v>

272
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.200
<v Speaker 2>the certainty of life after death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it allowed them the comfort of </v>

273
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.650
<v Speaker 2>knowing that an all seeing father was </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching over them.</v>

274
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for,</v>

275
00:15:21.791 --> 00:15:24.680
<v Speaker 2>I'd regard that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say as immature and manipulative,</v>

276
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:29.690
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't have a good explanation </v>
<v Speaker 2>for why people came up with the idea of </v>

277
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.840
<v Speaker 2>hell because if you were just going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go for immature and manipulative,</v>

278
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.250
<v Speaker 2>it might as well be all positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

279
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Why put the negative in there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could say skeptically,</v>

280
00:15:38.941 --> 00:15:43.941
<v Speaker 2>well hell is where you put your enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a really cynical </v>

281
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:46.440
<v Speaker 2>interpretation because many religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and now certainly even,</v>

282
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:51.590
<v Speaker 2>but certainly throughout the Middle Ages</v>
<v Speaker 2>were terrified that hell was something </v>

283
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.750
<v Speaker 2>that they were headed to do.</v>

284
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Not the random is we're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think that that's a </v>

285
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.940
<v Speaker 2>reasonable interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Historically.</v>

286
00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:02.330
<v Speaker 2>I know mark's would say that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that religion was when do whatever it </v>

287
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.940
<v Speaker 2>could to manipulate people so that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>power structure is the economic power </v>

288
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:07.350
<v Speaker 2>structures can stay in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

289
00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.490
<v Speaker 2>given that religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious structures,</v>

290
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:16.580
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say particularly but not only </v>

291
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.281
<v Speaker 2>true of Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have played a tremendous role in giving </v>

292
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:21.840
<v Speaker 2>additional voice to the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>downtrodden and slaved.</v>

293
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 2>That that also was a historically </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

294
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.790
<v Speaker 2>that's not a historic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible argument.</v>

295
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes religious teachings are used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to buttress the people who are in </v>

296
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.330
<v Speaker 2>control and sometimes they're used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppose them.</v>

297
00:16:33.331 --> 00:16:36.600
<v Speaker 2>So I don't mind that for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>

298
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.620
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the manipulation argument </v>

299
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:42.620
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a credible one.</v>

300
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand it and I'm an admirer of </v>

301
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

302
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.710
<v Speaker 2>but I think he got wrong.</v>

303
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:51.590
<v Speaker 2>I think he walked out wrong and that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly one of the places that he </v>

304
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:55.020
<v Speaker 2>disagreed most profoundly with Carla Yom</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think only came out of it right in</v>

305
00:16:55.021 --> 00:16:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Freud came out of it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

306
00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.060
<v Speaker 2>and then I think the Marxist critique of</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>

307
00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:01.710
<v Speaker 2>it's just like every other Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 2>critique.</v>

308
00:17:01.711 --> 00:17:02.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

309
00:17:02.311 --> 00:17:04.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can treat religious religion,</v>

310
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.960
<v Speaker 2>religious structures is if they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressive.</v>

311
00:17:06.961 --> 00:17:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Power structure is only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

312
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.500
<v Speaker 2>it is just a reduction of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>multidimensional complexity to a,</v>

313
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:20.560
<v Speaker 2>to a relatively predictable </v>
<v Speaker 2>unidimensional dimensional in a </v>

314
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.810
<v Speaker 2>dimensional phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not helpful.</v>

315
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:26.930
<v Speaker 2>It's not unhelpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intellectual exercise passed its </v>

316
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:26.930
<v Speaker 2>immediate self evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

317
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.330
<v Speaker 2>because the self evidence is some </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious people are corrupt.</v>

318
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:31.260
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

319
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.660
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously</v>

320
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.170
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fair.</v>

321
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:40.230
<v Speaker 1>And given the I'm taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking one concept heaven way out of</v>

322
00:17:41.381 --> 00:17:44.500
<v Speaker 1>context of a huge bundle of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

323
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a writer named,</v>

324
00:17:46.321 --> 00:17:48.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should tell you about this guy,</v>

325
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Jeffrey Burton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russell,</v>

326
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Jeffrey Burton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russell.</v>

327
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 2>You'd like him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

328
00:17:55.831 --> 00:18:00.831
<v Speaker 2>He's written a couple of books on heaven</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a very good series on the devil as a</v>

329
00:18:01.531 --> 00:18:06.531
<v Speaker 2>historian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's a historian of the idea of </v>

330
00:18:06.531 --> 00:18:09.261
<v Speaker 2>heaven and the idea of the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had three volume series on the </v>

331
00:18:09.261 --> 00:18:10.080
<v Speaker 2>devil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is Mephistopheles,</v>

332
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:13.680
<v Speaker 2>which I think is the best one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're interested in,</v>

333
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.410
<v Speaker 2>in that kind of idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeffrey Burton,</v>

334
00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Russell is a good person to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take a look at.</v>

335
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.470
<v Speaker 2>He's credible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>credible historian.</v>

336
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:24.750
<v Speaker 2>And I think his books are extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>

337
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 2>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he delves into the idea of heaven in</v>

338
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:30.780
<v Speaker 2>a much more fundamental way than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the typical.</v>

339
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Especially the typical sort of cowardly </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious critical postmodern is to </v>

340
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:39.510
<v Speaker 2>always assume that there's nothing to it</v>
<v Speaker 2>except power dynamics.</v>

341
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:44.690
<v Speaker 2>It's foolish because having a minimum is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a vision of a better future even even as</v>

342
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.410
<v Speaker 2>even as only that.</v>

343
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.450
<v Speaker 2>It's by no means trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

344
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.600
<v Speaker 2>human beings are about the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures that can imagine a better </v>

345
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.600
<v Speaker 2>future and so heaven is like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>architects will better future.</v>

346
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't want to just demolish that </v>

347
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:04.110
<v Speaker 2>idea too casually because we're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

348
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Unless we're pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're always working for a better </v>

349
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:09.380
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

350
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 2>And to think of heaven is the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of shining behind that,</v>

351
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:12.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

352
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.750
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the implied tonic ideal of the idea of a</v>

353
00:19:15.751 --> 00:19:20.751
<v Speaker 2>better future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a perfectly reasonable thing to </v>

354
00:19:20.751 --> 00:19:23.661
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't want to just throw it away </v>

355
00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:24.510
<v Speaker 2>that that'd be throwing away one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest ideas of mankind.</v>

356
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.720
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't mean I think the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be politically utopians.</v>

357
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:28.770
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same thing.</v>

358
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

359
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:35.430
<v Speaker 1>it's the concept that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has the psychological effects on </v>

360
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.430
<v Speaker 1>the way people behave.</v>

361
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

362
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right.</v>

363
00:19:37.851 --> 00:19:42.851
<v Speaker 2>And it's the concept that some value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think the difference between the </v>

364
00:19:42.851 --> 00:19:46.061
<v Speaker 2>Christian idea of having an political </v>
<v Speaker 2>utopian idea of having is that for </v>

365
00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Christians having is what would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieved through the use of truth,</v>

366
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:55.540
<v Speaker 2>individual truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for the political utopian would be </v>

367
00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.810
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of the instantiation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>some particular political system.</v>

368
00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.520
<v Speaker 2>The same thing at all.</v>

369
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:04.850
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we have about 10 more minutes </v>

370
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.850
<v Speaker 1>by my time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

371
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.730
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

372
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.940
<v Speaker 1>you answered those questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really good question.</v>

373
00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

374
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I spent a long time thinking which to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask because obviously there's a million </v>

375
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.690
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're one that the only people I've had</v>

376
00:20:16.691 --> 00:20:19.180
<v Speaker 1>faith in that could answer some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions I've had.</v>

377
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.650
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

378
00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to think of myself as a </v>

379
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:26.820
<v Speaker 1>philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socrates.</v>

380
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I am a student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go in and out of school.</v>

381
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I tend to make money when I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing our jobs in green day.</v>

382
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't have a lot of value on </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

383
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Societies.</v>

384
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.120
<v Speaker 2>What are your future plans?</v>

385
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I want to go into academia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do research.</v>

386
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty smart.</v>

387
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good plan.</v>

388
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Those are good questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

389
00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:55.840
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's school is expensive in the types of</v>

390
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:58.780
<v Speaker 1>schools that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to were kind of boring.</v>

391
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.730
<v Speaker 1>I like if I could go to your class every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

392
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.850
<v Speaker 1>I would be the happiest person ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

393
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.570
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the type of teachers,</v>

394
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:11.580
<v Speaker 1>not that they're not intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just not a Sam Harris or Neil </v>

395
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.100
<v Speaker 1>degrasse Tyson or a Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time reading,</v>

396
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.710
<v Speaker 1>reading through Einstein over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

397
00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:21.340
<v Speaker 1>reading through our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to Neil degrasse Tyson.</v>

398
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.900
<v Speaker 1>I liked learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

399
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.610
<v Speaker 1>the university doesn't give me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

400
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.120
<v Speaker 1>substantial means of learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I learned much.</v>

401
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I get the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get the picture.</v>

402
00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:38.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem that you've got is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some utility in credentials.</v>

403
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:46.390
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always the possibility of going </v>

404
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.360
<v Speaker 2>to university for the credentials and </v>
<v Speaker 2>educating yourself at the same time what</v>

405
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.910
<v Speaker 2>you really have to do if you go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>university anyways.</v>

406
00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I know it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

407
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.760
<v Speaker 2>it's always an uncomfortable meld </v>
<v Speaker 2>between what you want and what should be</v>

408
00:21:55.761 --> 00:21:56.960
<v Speaker 2>and what you can get.</v>

409
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Twain says,</v>

410
00:21:58.441 --> 00:22:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I never let my schooling interfere with </v>
<v Speaker 1>my education.</v>

411
00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

412
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

413
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.580
<v Speaker 2>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

414
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a couple of semesters left.</v>

415
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is I don't know.</v>

416
00:22:09.981 --> 00:22:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a couple of semesters left.</v>

417
00:22:12.801 --> 00:22:16.490
<v Speaker 1>I go to the University of Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is my motivation,</v>

418
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:21.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've watched a lot of the videos </v>

419
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.981
<v Speaker 1>on your motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't find the motivation to do the </v>

420
00:22:23.981 --> 00:22:27.521
<v Speaker 1>work if I was at Harvard or Princeton or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yale or somewhere where I was </v>

421
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:27.710
<v Speaker 1>challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I would be like,</v>

422
00:22:27.711 --> 00:22:29.230
<v Speaker 1>this is a huge opportunity for me.</v>

423
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to build the judge for </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself somehow.</v>

424
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Have you done the future?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The what program?</v>

425
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Future authoring program?</v>

426
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

427
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

428
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:48.900
<v Speaker 1>I think I was too focused subconsciously</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the reasons why it would help,</v>

429
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>determining why,</v>

430
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:58.050
<v Speaker 1>why this would help me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's helping me because of this is </v>

431
00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:59.650
<v Speaker 1>helping me because of that in kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like playing mind games with myself,</v>

432
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.770
<v Speaker 1>making it so it didn't really help me as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

433
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

434
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:04.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

435
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.670
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact is,</v>

436
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.610
<v Speaker 2>given,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given your level of,</v>

437
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:14.520
<v Speaker 2>let's say again to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have to have a pretty good </v>

438
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.600
<v Speaker 2>goal to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know it's not atypical for someone to</v>

439
00:23:16.601 --> 00:23:19.360
<v Speaker 2>be very smart and very open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not very conscientious.</v>

440
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.660
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if you're not very </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious,</v>

441
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.870
<v Speaker 2>maybe you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what you said so far suggests that </v>

442
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:28.390
<v Speaker 2>you're higher in openness and lowering </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness.</v>

443
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.770
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you need to rectify that if you're,</v>

444
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.820
<v Speaker 2>if you can rectify it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this suitably lofty goal and so,</v>

445
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:38.120
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

446
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:43.260
<v Speaker 2>but if you didn't do the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoring program in a manner that </v>

447
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 2>helped you establish that goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably isn't going to help you.</v>

448
00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you obviously need to reason and fair</v>

449
00:23:47.301 --> 00:23:48.050
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

450
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:53.680
<v Speaker 1>So I guess my goal would to be going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Grad school at an Ivy League college.</v>

451
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

452
00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.150
<v Speaker 1>And I'll have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

453
00:23:59.151 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 1>at one point I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

454
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.400
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a letter to like basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody that works at the Harvard </v>

455
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:07.910
<v Speaker 1>admissions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my finding the,</v>

456
00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:09.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

457
00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:12.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emails and,</v>

458
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.280
<v Speaker 1>and like sent a letter explaining my </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

459
00:24:16.281 --> 00:24:21.281
<v Speaker 1>my family situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why I didn't get good grades in high </v>

460
00:24:21.281 --> 00:24:23.981
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why I've never been on a typical good </v>

461
00:24:23.981 --> 00:24:26.711
<v Speaker 1>student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have a large drive and motivation </v>

462
00:24:26.711 --> 00:24:29.921
<v Speaker 1>to learn and I know every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor at Harvard and I'm familiar </v>

463
00:24:29.921 --> 00:24:31.940
<v Speaker 1>with their work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read their abstracts in their,</v>

464
00:24:31.941 --> 00:24:33.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their journals.</v>

465
00:24:33.111 --> 00:24:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Not every single one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe exaggerating,</v>

466
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:39.850
<v Speaker 1>but I'm very familiar and with Yale too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why did they go into linguistics and</v>

467
00:24:40.251 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 1>I never got a response back and I kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of just sunk back into my,</v>

468
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.270
<v Speaker 1>my read and ignore the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

469
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.720
<v Speaker 1>the universe type of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they definitely where I need to set </v>

470
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.951
<v Speaker 1>a goal and not sink back into my </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior like central drift,</v>

471
00:24:57.051 --> 00:24:58.400
<v Speaker 1>but actually go towards that goal.</v>

472
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

473
00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:05.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a good goal to go to Grad who </v>

474
00:25:05.681 --> 00:25:07.881
<v Speaker 2>are incredible graduate school and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursue an academic career as a good </v>

475
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:10.811
<v Speaker 2>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also might want to really think </v>

476
00:25:10.811 --> 00:25:13.601
<v Speaker 2>hard about what the hell you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do if that doesn't happen because you </v>

477
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.380
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of built for it.</v>

478
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.000
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be a good pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

479
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:23.450
<v Speaker 2>you sound like the kind of guy who could</v>
<v Speaker 2>use a phd so.</v>

480
00:25:23.451 --> 00:25:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your questions were smart,</v>

481
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to listen to them heart and you </v>

482
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:29.920
<v Speaker 2>thought about them a lot and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated,</v>

483
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:29.920
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

484
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that puts you in the top one percent</v>

485
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:36.260
<v Speaker 2>of students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably something like that,</v>

486
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.500
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one to five percent.</v>

487
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.380
<v Speaker 2>And so you've got the right kind of mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

488
00:25:42.381 --> 00:25:47.381
<v Speaker 2>And with a mind like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also really want to get yourself </v>

489
00:25:47.381 --> 00:25:47.720
<v Speaker 2>disciplined because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

490
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.640
<v Speaker 2>it's also safer if you have a mind like </v>
<v Speaker 2>yours to get disciplined because the </v>

491
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.160
<v Speaker 2>problem with a mind like yours isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll,</v>

492
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:56.360
<v Speaker 2>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll,</v>

493
00:25:56.361 --> 00:25:58.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be chasing it everywhere.</v>

494
00:25:58.611 --> 00:26:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Like someone with annealed a badly </v>
<v Speaker 2>trained bloodhound.</v>

495
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

496
00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

497
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.210
<v Speaker 2>that can be really hard on a person over</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

498
00:26:07.211 --> 00:26:12.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's easy to be one of those </v>

499
00:26:12.211 --> 00:26:14.461
<v Speaker 2>people that has a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential but doesn't have it realized </v>

500
00:26:14.461 --> 00:26:16.240
<v Speaker 2>and why that's a rough life by the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're about 40.</v>

501
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also,</v>

502
00:26:17.731 --> 00:26:22.731
<v Speaker 1>what is a linguistically defined as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>polymath where academia is one interest </v>

503
00:26:24.991 --> 00:26:28.050
<v Speaker 1>that I'm showing you right now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an academic,</v>

504
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:33.290
<v Speaker 1>but I have a wide variety of interests </v>
<v Speaker 1>like music,</v>

505
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:34.350
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>

506
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

507
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.820
<v Speaker 2>that's where my thinking fitness</v>

508
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.180
<v Speaker 1>is high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do have other opportunity,</v>

509
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>childish Donald Glover,</v>

510

<v Speaker 1>he is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a rapper and I'm a standup comedian</v>

511
00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 1>and he's writing deadpool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done.</v>

512
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very,</v>

513
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:02.220
<v Speaker 1>very identify a lot with him looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>him as a role model.</v>

514
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.090
<v Speaker 1>He does a lot of different things and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

515
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

516
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:12.260
<v Speaker 1>the profanity in his work makes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>discredits his talent by a lot of </v>

517
00:27:13.741 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like so did,</v>

518
00:27:15.691 --> 00:27:17.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare,</v>

519
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean basically what the things he says</v>
<v Speaker 1>is witty and punny and a pro,</v>

520
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 1>a profane of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so is Shakespeare,</v>

521
00:27:28.771 --> 00:27:30.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the time.</v>

522
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.310
<v Speaker 1>But I identify a lot with him.</v>

523
00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid I have to bring on someone </v>

524
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:38.950
<v Speaker 3>else's right up here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
