1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.460
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the distribution of scores.</v>

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Now that's dismal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dismal thing to look at.</v>

3
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand that why look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this zero,</v>

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The median person has not done anything </v>

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>creative ever in their life with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything on any dimension,</v>

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really important to know that.</v>

7
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>And then you have these horrible people </v>
<v Speaker 1>out here,</v>

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do everything.</v>

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>They do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Price's law.</v>

10
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Here's price's law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something to hammer into your </v>

11
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.501
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The square root of the number of people </v>

12
00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>in a domain do 50 percent of the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

13
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go through that.</v>

14
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 1>You have 10 employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three of them do,</v>

15
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>half the work makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's reasonable.</v>

16
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>You have 100 employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 of them do half the work.</v>

17
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the other 90 percent are doing the </v>

18
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>other half who cares about them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have 10,000</v>

19
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 of them do half the work,</v>

20
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Speaker 1>So here's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a nasty little law.</v>

22
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>As your company grows in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>competence grows exponentially and </v>

23
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>competence grows linearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It right?</v>

24
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Because it with 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's three who are doing half the work,</v>

25
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>but at 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 100 that are doing half the work,</v>

26
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:13.911
<v Speaker 1>so 9,900</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your employees are doing as much as </v>

27
00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:17.481
<v Speaker 1>the best 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not even know who the best </v>

28
00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:20.301
<v Speaker 1>$100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably they know and maybe their </v>

29
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:22.911
<v Speaker 1>peers know too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that's really </v>

30
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:22.911
<v Speaker 1>interesting when big companies start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shake,</v>

31
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>which means maybe they've had a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter,</v>

32
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>two bad quarters and the stock price </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to tip down and the people,</v>

33
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 1>the hot people who have options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not very happy about that and </v>

34
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.861
<v Speaker 1>maybe they start to announce layoffs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All 100 people who have opportunities </v>

35
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>leave and they're the ones who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing half the work.</v>

36
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.690
<v Speaker 1>So boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that puts your company in a pretty rough</v>

37
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>situation because now you've got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>9,900</v>

38
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:47.571
<v Speaker 1>people left over who were only doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>half the work and the next time you </v>

39
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:49.260
<v Speaker 1>announce layoffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next most productive hundred leave.</v>

40
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're left with nobody who </v>
<v Speaker 1>is productive at a massive overhead.</v>

41
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:58.551
<v Speaker 1>Payroll price's law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look that up to solar price to </v>

42
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:02.690
<v Speaker 1>solar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Price is a guy who was looking at </v>

43
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.031
<v Speaker 1>scientific productivity and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things he found was when he was looking </v>

44
00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:08.331
<v Speaker 1>at Phd students is that the median </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of publications for a phd </v>

45
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>graduate when he did his work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was in the early sixties,</v>

46
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>was one half as many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had two,</v>

47
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 1>half as many as that had three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half as many as that had four.</v>

48
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a real step down and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corollaries of that is that there's a </v>

49
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.391
<v Speaker 1>certain number of people who are hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive and that's these people out </v>

50
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>here and if you were graphing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

51
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>let's say you graft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people in our population of </v>

52
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$10,000</v>

53
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>in a savings account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would look very much like this.</v>

54
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Some of them would have some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them would.</v>

55
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Most people would have no savings </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

56
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>The median person would have no savings </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever and then you go up here where</v>

57
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:47.730
<v Speaker 1>the one percent is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all the money,</v>

58
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand about that one percent issue </v>

59
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.151
<v Speaker 1>that you always hear about is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>applies in every single realm where </v>

60
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>there's difference in creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>

61
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Every realm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

62
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Number of records produced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of records sold,</v>

63
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>number of compositions written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

64
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.940
<v Speaker 1>here's an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five composers produce the music that </v>

65
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>occupies 50 percent of the classical rep</v>
<v Speaker 1>repertoire,</v>

66
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bach,</v>

67
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Beethoven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brahms,</v>

68
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Tchaikovsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mozart.</v>

69
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those five.</v>

70
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's something cool.</v>

71
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.120
<v Speaker 1>So you take all the music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people wrote five percent of the </v>

72
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.811
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those people wrote occupies 50 </v>

73
00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>percent of the music that have their </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing that's played.</v>

74
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.770
<v Speaker 1>So not only do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all of the composers never get </v>

75
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.920
<v Speaker 1>allison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even among the composers do get a </v>

76
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.920
<v Speaker 1>list and almost none of their music ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets played.</v>

77
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.220
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then that's it.</v>

78
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.240
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example of this price's law </v>

79
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>scaling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when it applies to all sorts of </v>

80
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like number of hockey goal scored,</v>

81
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.210
<v Speaker 1>who's also a distributed this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of basketball,</v>

82
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.450
<v Speaker 1>basketball basketball's successfully put</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the who follows the same </v>

83
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>size of cities follows the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

85
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird law and you can think about</v>

86
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>it in part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does this happen while,</v>

87
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 1>imagine what happens when you play </v>
<v Speaker 1>monopoly?</v>

88
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.350
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has the same amount of money </v>

89
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.350
<v Speaker 1>to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.640
<v Speaker 1>So then you start playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically a random game while some </v>

91
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 1>people start to wind a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people start to lose a bit.</v>

92
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>And then if you win probability that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll keep winning starts to increase.</v>

93
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 1>And if you lose your vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases as you lose.</v>

94
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say six people playing monopoly,</v>

95
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One person has zero.</v>

96
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 1>What happens when they have zero?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're out of the game.</v>

97
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>So zero is a weird number because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit zero,</v>

98
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 1>you're out of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

99
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 1>so then if you keep playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people start to stack up at zero,</v>

100
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens at the end of the game?</v>

101
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 1>One person has all the property and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the money and everyone else has none,</v>

102
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

103
00:04:49.311 --> 00:04:54.311
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens if you play an </v>
<v Speaker 1>iterated trading game to its final </v>

104
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:57.961
<v Speaker 1>conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of the law in a sense </v>

105
00:04:57.961 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 1>that's underlying this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

106
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

107
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.160
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a consequence necessarily of </v>

108
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.621
<v Speaker 1>structural inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's built into the system at a deeper </v>

109
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:07.621
<v Speaker 1>level than that.</v>

110
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk about all the time about how</v>

111
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:13.651
<v Speaker 1>unfair it is that the one percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population has the vast amount of the </v>

112
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:17.431
<v Speaker 1>money and one percent of the one percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>has most of that money and one percent </v>

113
00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:21.361
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one percent of the one percent has most </v>

114
00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:21.361
<v Speaker 1>of that money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is a,</v>

115
00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:25.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an inevitable conclusion of </v>

116
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 1>iterated trading games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know how to fight it.</v>

117
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.170
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to take from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have and move it to the </v>

118
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 1>bottom without instantly moving back up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the top.</v>

119
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Different people maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still back up to the top because </v>

120
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.641
<v Speaker 1>even the one percent churns a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think you have a 10 percent </v>

121
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 1>chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

122
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:47.341
<v Speaker 1>you have a 10 percent chance of being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top one percent for at least one </v>

123
00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:51.121
<v Speaker 1>year of your life and a 40 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance of being in the top 10 percent </v>

124
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 1>for at least one year in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's in Canada and the US,</v>

125
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>it's less so in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a fair bit of churning at the</v>

126
00:05:56.951 --> 00:05:59.320
<v Speaker 1>top end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same people all the time.</v>

127
00:05:59.321 --> 00:06:04.321
<v Speaker 1>We will have the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is a tiny fraction of the people </v>

128
00:06:04.321 --> 00:06:04.321
<v Speaker 1>all the time who have all the money.</v>
