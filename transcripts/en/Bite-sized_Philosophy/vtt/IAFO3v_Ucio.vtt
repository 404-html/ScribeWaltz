1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I started to pay very careful attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to what I was saying.</v>

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily or involuntarily,</v>

3
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:12.621
<v Speaker 1>but I could feel a sort of split </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing in my psyche and the split </v>

4
00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:16.611
<v Speaker 1>and I've actually had students tell me </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing has happened to them </v>

5
00:00:16.611 --> 00:00:18.410
<v Speaker 1>after they've listened to some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>material that,</v>

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>that I've been describing to all of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but split into two,</v>

7
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one part was the,</v>

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.690
<v Speaker 1>let's say the old me that was talking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot and that liked to argue and that </v>

9
00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>liked ideas and there was another part </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was watching that part,</v>

10
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.920
<v Speaker 1>like just with it's eyes open and </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutrally judging and the part that was </v>

11
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>neutrally judging was watching the part </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was talking and going,</v>

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>that isn't your idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really believe that you don't </v>

13
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>really know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't true.</v>

14
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

15
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>that's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>

16
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>and that was happening to like 95 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of what I was saying and so then</v>

17
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

18
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is strange,</v>

19
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>so maybe I fragmented and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a good thing at all.</v>

20
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like it was hearing voices or </v>

21
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.930
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

23
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>people have multiple parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then I had this weird conundrum.</v>

25
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

26
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:25.851
<v Speaker 1>which of those two things are me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it the part that's listening and </v>

27
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

28
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>that's rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lie.</v>

29
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>That's you're doing that to impress </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

30
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>You're just trying to win the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 1>was that me or was the part that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going about my normal verbal business?</v>

32
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Me and I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I decided I would go with the critic</v>

33
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>and then what I tried to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I learned to do I think was to stop</v>

34
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:51.891
<v Speaker 1>saying things that made me weak and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I mean I'm still trying to do that </v>

35
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:57.561
<v Speaker 1>because I'm always feeling when I talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the words that I'm saying</v>

36
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>are either making the align or making me</v>
<v Speaker 1>come apart,</v>

37
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>and I think the alignment.</v>

38
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.180
<v Speaker 1>I really do think the alignment is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think alignment is the right way of </v>

39
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.571
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing it because I think if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say things that are as true as you </v>

40
00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>can say them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

41
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 1>then they come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come out of the depths inside of </v>

42
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>you because we don't know where thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 1>come from.</v>

43
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.190
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how far down into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>substructure,</v>

44
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.440
<v Speaker 1>the thoughts he merged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what processes have </v>

45
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.020
<v Speaker 1>physiological alignment are necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to speak from the core of your </v>

46
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand any of that.</v>

47
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>We don't even conceptualize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe that you can feel that and</v>

48
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I learned some of that from reading Carl</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers,</v>

49
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:41.031
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a great clinician because he </v>

50
00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:42.250
<v Speaker 1>talked about mental health in part as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the coherence between the,</v>

51
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.860
<v Speaker 1>the spiritual or the or the abstract and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physical that the two things were </v>

52
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.570
<v Speaker 1>aligned and there's a lot of idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>alignment in,</v>

53
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>in psychoanalytic and clinical thinking.</v>

54
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.130
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided that I would start practicing </v>

55
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>not saying things that would make me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happened was that I had to stop</v>

56
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.250
<v Speaker 1>saying almost everything that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick.</v>

57
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I would say 95 percent of it as a hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a shock to wake up,</v>

58
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:13.141
<v Speaker 1>and I mean this was over a few months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a hell of a shock to wake up </v>

59
00:03:13.141 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>and realize that you're mostly dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>wood.</v>

60
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a shock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

62
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>do you really want all of that to burn </v>
<v Speaker 1>off?</v>

63
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

64
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a little husk,</v>

65
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>five percent of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

66
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that five percent is solid,</v>

67
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>then maybe that's exactly what you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have happen.</v>

68
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I told you that story is an </v>

69
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.151
<v Speaker 1>elaboration of this line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and God saw that the wickedness of man </v>

70
00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:41.941
<v Speaker 1>was great in the earth and that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine have the imagination of the </v>

71
00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:45.031
<v Speaker 1>thoughts of his heart was only evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually to question worth asking </v>

72
00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>just exactly what are your motives?</v>

73
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're purer than mine were and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly possible.</v>

75
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that I'm naturally a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly good person.</v>

76
00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I think I have to work at it very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard and I don't necessarily think </v>

77
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.981
<v Speaker 1>that everyone is like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people are worse than that and </v>

78
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:11.131
<v Speaker 1>everyone's like that to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's worth thinking about just how </v>

79
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 1>much trouble are you trying to cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:20.191
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing you might think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about is that if you're not doing </v>

81
00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>something important with your life by </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own definition,</v>

82
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>because that's the game that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing,</v>

83
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>you get to define the terms at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>initially,</v>

84
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're prone to cause trouble just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have anything better </v>

85
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>to do because at least it's trouble is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more interesting than boring.</v>

86
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something you learn if you read </v>

87
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does Tsq knew that extraordinarily well.</v>

88
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.960
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're not doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not pushing yourself to the </v>

89
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>limits of your capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have plenty of leftover.</v>

90
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

91
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Willpower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and resources to devote,</v>

92
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.720
<v Speaker 1>causing interesting trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so while so I would say this is also</v>

93
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:59.941
<v Speaker 1>an archetypal scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God saw that the wickedness of man was </v>

94
00:04:59.941 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>great in the earth and that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination of the thoughts of his heart</v>

95
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:06.271
<v Speaker 1>was only evil continually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something to meditate on and it's</v>

96
00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>not self destructive because what it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an attempt to.</v>

97
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like the diagnosis of an illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if that does happen to be the </v>

98
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.901
<v Speaker 1>case for you or to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's only 10 percent of you or </v>

99
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's 90 percent,</v>

100
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.420
<v Speaker 1>well then coming to terms with that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent because then maybe you can </v>

101
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 1>stop doing it and what would be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>downside to that?</v>

102
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.310
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to give up your resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously in your hatred and all of </v>

103
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really annoying because those</v>

104
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.141
<v Speaker 1>emotions are very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're easy to engage in in there and </v>

105
00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:40.861
<v Speaker 1>they're engaging and they have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of self righteousness with them </v>

106
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:44.491
<v Speaker 1>and that goes along with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're not doing this in order to </v>

107
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:49.681
<v Speaker 1>put yourself down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing this in order to separate </v>

108
00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:52.711
<v Speaker 1>the wheat from the chaff and to leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you don't have to be </v>

109
00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:52.711
<v Speaker 1>behind.</v>
