1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.260
<v Speaker 1>We certainly choose each other for self </v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness and consciousness and </v>

2
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if you're,</v>

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>if you're choosing a mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an arms race in human beings.</v>

4
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:17.181
<v Speaker 1>We're choosing intelligent mates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially that's especially the case </v>

5
00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>for women in relationship to men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

6
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>the idea that that's a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:25.380
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why it's even that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself conscious in the garden of Eden,</v>

9
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She offers them the apple.</v>

10
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.910
<v Speaker 1>She's the one that makes him self </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious and I think that's actually </v>

11
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.911
<v Speaker 1>accurate because the evidence from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biologists is that human </v>

12
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>sexual female sexual selection was what </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the driving factors that </v>

13
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 1>differentiated us from chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a major factor.</v>

14
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzee females are not selective </v>
<v Speaker 1>maters.</v>

15
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>They go into estrus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll mate with anything.</v>

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>What happens is the dominant males </v>
<v Speaker 1>chased the subordinate males away and so</v>

17
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:56.001
<v Speaker 1>they end up leaving more offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a consequence of selection </v>

18
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:56.001
<v Speaker 1>on the part of the females in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

19
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:00.770
<v Speaker 1>It's completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Concealed ovulation and intense </v>

20
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.821
<v Speaker 1>selection pressure from women on men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have twice as many female ancestors </v>

21
00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:08.451
<v Speaker 1>as you have male ancestors and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>could never have have a hard time </v>

22
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>working that out arithmetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that problematic.</v>

23
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>You just think on average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every woman had one child,</v>

24
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>half of men had none,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other half had to.</v>

25
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's approximately correct if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>average across the entire history of </v>

26
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>human sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So human males in particular are subject</v>

27
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>to a vicious selection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure on the part of females,</v>

28
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:34.341
<v Speaker 1>and I also think that's partly why </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature is represented symbolically as </v>

29
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>female among human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because after all,</v>

30
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:43.041
<v Speaker 1>nature is what selects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no better definition of the </v>

31
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 1>nature then that which selects.</v>
