00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Hey Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious about the connection between</v>

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.220
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic beauty and religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

3
00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I think you've hinted at it once or </v>
<v Speaker 1>twice over the course of the lecture.</v>

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible,</v>

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for something that's incredibly </v>

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.561
<v Speaker 1>beautiful to evoke or religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious or mystical experience or </v>

7
00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>something of in the same ballpark is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're for?</v>

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

9
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

10
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>like a renaissance cathedral was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to check my,</v>

11
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my tag onto.</v>

12
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.120
<v Speaker 1>I apologize you mentioned trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My tag onto that question.</v>

13
00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:37.600
<v Speaker 1>The next part was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.820
<v Speaker 1>is that why we have cathedral is built </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a spectacular buildings as opposed </v>

15
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>to make socks or something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

16
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to how's the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>

18
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>you build something beautiful right to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to represent it's dwelling place and it </v>

19
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:56.631
<v Speaker 1>should be beautiful and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that people do not take </v>

20
00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:56.631
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

21
00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>And this is especially something we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take seriously in Canada.</v>

22
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the you think about,</v>

23
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>you think about all the hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars that were invested </v>

24
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>into beauty in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean spectacular,</v>

25
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>excessive investment in beauty that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid back.</v>

26
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.240
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how many multiples of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times people make pilgrimages to Europe </v>

27
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>constantly because it's so beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it just staggers you.</v>

28
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Beauty is so valuable and we're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of it and I think we're afraid of</v>

29
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>it because it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pathway.</v>

30
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only pathway to the divine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's lot.</v>

31
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 1>There's pathways to the divine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love is one of them I suppose,</v>

32
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>but beauty especially for people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an affinity for,</v>

33
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like music.</v>

34
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>argue against,</v>

35
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even understand.</v>

36
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>It just hits you and it does.</v>

37
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>It shows you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>it shows you the ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it,</v>

39
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:55.071
<v Speaker 1>but it also shows you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a vision of the </v>

40
00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>potential future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that as well that if</v>

41
00:01:56.611 --> 00:02:01.611
<v Speaker 1>we just got our act together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautified things that that's the place </v>

42
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>that we can inhabit and not winning </v>
<v Speaker 1>noble us and that's why this Jerusalem,</v>

43
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>the heavily city is paved with </v>
<v Speaker 1>gemstones,</v>

44
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their crystalline,</v>

45
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:13.461
<v Speaker 1>the admit light and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the proper dwelling place for an </v>

46
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:17.181
<v Speaker 1>enlightened consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ut is the proper dwelling place for an </v>

47
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:20.421
<v Speaker 1>enlightened consciousness and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ignore it at our inner spiritual and </v>

48
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.000
<v Speaker 1>economic peril.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's our,</v>

49
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious that,</v>

50
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.380
<v Speaker 1>but there's almost nothing more valuable</v>
<v Speaker 1>than but economically,</v>

51
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 1>practically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

52
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

53
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very.</v>

54
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean why we,</v>

55
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.010
<v Speaker 1>we experienced gemstones for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is beautiful.</v>

56
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>It's very mysterious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're deep reasons for it.</v>

57
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
