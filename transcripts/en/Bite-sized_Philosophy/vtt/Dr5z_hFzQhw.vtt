1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>It's because the bloody intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>leftists have never apologized for their</v>

2
00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>complicity in the catastrophes of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>The Germans apologized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about the Nazis.</v>

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left wing intellectuals,</v>

5
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was real.</v>

7
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't real Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

8
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

9
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.500
<v Speaker 1>How many carbs does have to pile up </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you before you're willing to </v>

10
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.191
<v Speaker 1>question your beloved ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions and face your resentment</v>

11
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>and your narcissism and your desire for </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction.</v>

12
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>You don't like people anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The planet has too many of them,</v>

13
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 1>so like a nice warm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cleared out.</v>

14
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Well then all the plants can grow again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the club of Rome,</v>

15
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>when they talked about the population </v>
<v Speaker 1>explosion that was going to wipe out the</v>

16
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:49.671
<v Speaker 1>planet by the year 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say outright that human beings are </v>

17
00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>a cancer on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people think that.</v>

18
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh boy,</v>

19
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>next put the atom bomb a phone in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

20
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are a cancer on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a hell of a thing to say?</v>

21
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.820
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that to a four year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw bloody professor at Queen's </v>

22
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.140
<v Speaker 1>University.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell a whole room full of 18 year olds </v>

23
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>that if they had an ethical fiber in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their body,</v>

24
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:14.361
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't have any kids or they only</v>
<v Speaker 1>have one because all they're doing is </v>

25
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>going out there and raping the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

26
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

28
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like human beings are hard on the </v>

29
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.811
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty damn hard on us in </v>

30
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:26.811
<v Speaker 1>return.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

31
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're just sort of trying not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to die to miserably and we make a bit of</v>

32
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

34
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>

35
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>we've only known for 50 years that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were disrupting the oceans.</v>

36
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>How fast do you think we can learn in </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 years ago,</v>

37
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Huxley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a great biologist,</v>

38
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oceans are so plentiful.</v>

39
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.420
<v Speaker 1>It was not a chance we could ever put a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dent in them.</v>

40
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>So there's only 100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty years ago we thought,</v>

41
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:55.371
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more of us and we're better at </v>

42
00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:55.371
<v Speaker 1>this than we thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

43
00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how fast do you expect people to learn?</v>

44
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one generation,</v>

45
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>one year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to do our best.</v>

46
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are trying to do their best </v>

47
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>and some people are trying to do their </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst,</v>

48
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:11.511
<v Speaker 1>but most people are trying to do their </v>
<v Speaker 1>best and so we should have a little </v>

49
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:14.721
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little sympathy for human beings </v>

50
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 1>instead of considering ourselves like </v>
<v Speaker 1>raping patriarchal,</v>

51
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>oppressive destroyers of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's this.</v>
