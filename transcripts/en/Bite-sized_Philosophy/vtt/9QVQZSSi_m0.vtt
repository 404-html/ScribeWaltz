1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Order surrounded by chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the the,</v>

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary home of primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tree with the snakes on the ground.</v>

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.750
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's our landscape or it's the fire </v>

5
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.930
<v Speaker 1>for tribal people and the terrors of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forest that are beyond the,</v>

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>that are beyond the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The light that the fire casts.</v>

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 1>It's explored territory versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory and that's,</v>

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>that's an archetype as well that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't not be in a situation where that's</v>

9
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're among friends,</v>

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that's explored territory.</v>

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.310
<v Speaker 1>That's not exactly right because what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens if you're among friends is that </v>

12
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>they carefully reveal new parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves all the time.</v>

13
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>So it's like they're blasting little </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of unexplored territory.</v>

14
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>You territory at you constantly and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

15
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.500
<v Speaker 1>then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get bored and you look for New </v>

16
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.221
<v Speaker 1>People and we know there's empirical </v>
<v Speaker 1>data on that with regards to intimate </v>

17
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:08.541
<v Speaker 1>relationships because there was a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>study done awhile back showing that </v>

18
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>looking at the ratio of positive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotional experiences that were</v>

19
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>most predictive of long term </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship success.</v>

20
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>And the answer was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:20.781
<v Speaker 1>obviously it depends on how you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure an event and how you would </v>

22
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 1>measure positive and negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that aside,</v>

23
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.950
<v Speaker 1>the finding was something like if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a relationship and you only have five</v>

24
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>positive interactions to one negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction,</v>

25
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>then the relationship will end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too negative.</v>

26
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.500
<v Speaker 1>But if you have more than 11 positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions to one negative </v>

27
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it also ends and you think,</v>

28
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>well that's pretty bloody peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wha why in the world would that be?</v>

29
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Don't you want like a hundred to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive to negative interactions and </v>

30
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>answer to that is what makes you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you wanted to relationship so that </v>

31
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>you can be happy or at least happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment to moment.</v>

32
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.600
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that it's not?</v>

33
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not the case is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that too because you.</v>

34
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I bet you there's not a person in</v>

35
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>this room who hasn't rejected someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were too nice to them.</v>

36
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Something like that person's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>

37
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:15.591
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want someone who you know you can </v>

38
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:18.801
<v Speaker 1>get along with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now and then they bite you and you </v>

39
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:18.801
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

40
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:18.801
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

41
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:22.700
<v Speaker 1>You know I didn't really expect that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go and puzzle over it for </v>

42
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.821
<v Speaker 1>awhile and you torture yourself about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the things that keeps </v>

43
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:29.241
<v Speaker 1>you really linked into the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that part of </v>

44
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:33.081
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship isn't so that you're happy </v>

45
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:35.571
<v Speaker 1>right now so that you can live a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality life across multiple decades and</v>

46
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>so you're looking for someone that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to contend with who's going to push</v>

47
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:45.471
<v Speaker 1>you beyond what you already are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to judge you harshly often </v>

48
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:49.881
<v Speaker 1>for your limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that'll make you angry and all of </v>

49
00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:49.881
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>and resentful and maybe you'll take your</v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge and and,</v>

51
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 1>and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want someone who thinks </v>

52
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.961
<v Speaker 1>you're perfect in your current foreign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly because why would you want to go </v>

53
00:02:59.961 --> 00:02:59.961
<v Speaker 1>out with someone that diluted.</v>
