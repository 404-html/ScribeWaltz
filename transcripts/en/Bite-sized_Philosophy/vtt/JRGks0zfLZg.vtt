1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.310
<v Speaker 1>So in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the garden of Eden,</v>

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Speaker 1>there's Adam and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:08.430
<v Speaker 1>The primordial human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there is a walled garden.</v>

4
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>That's paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paradise means walled garden.</v>

5
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:14.520
<v Speaker 1>An Eden means well watered place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this idea that the proper</v>

6
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:19.260
<v Speaker 1>habitat of human beings is an amalgam of</v>
<v Speaker 1>social structure and nat and nature.</v>

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we live in,</v>

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in,</v>

9
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>we never live in nature and we never </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in society.</v>

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>We live in an amalgam of society and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

11
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:32.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the human environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a walled garden.</v>

12
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a productive,</v>

13
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>well watered place where we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrive.</v>

14
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>It's safe and it's ruled over by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>father figure in this particular,</v>

15
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>in this particular story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's like the,</v>

16
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>you can think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the spirit of civilization.</v>

17
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>That's at least one way of considering </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

18
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

19
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.030
<v Speaker 1>well there's a snake in the garden and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there,</v>

20
00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>unbeknownst to God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

21
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>although he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows everything.</v>

22
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:06.921
<v Speaker 1>So I guess he probably knows about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake to and he tells Adam and Eve not </v>

23
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:08.350
<v Speaker 1>to interact with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find.</v>

24
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>And they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the snake wakes them up,</v>

25
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when they interact with the </v>

26
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.941
<v Speaker 1>snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're given a fruit that opens their </v>

27
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:16.941
<v Speaker 1>eyes and makes them aware that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>naked and vulnerable,</v>

28
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 1>and then dooms them to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

29
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you the whole story much later</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the course,</v>

30
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>but I want to give you an overview of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

31
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 1>but then there's this really strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that developed over the course of </v>

32
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.471
<v Speaker 1>the development of not only Christianity</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Judaism and and a number of other </v>

33
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>religions that fed into the mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Christian ideas,</v>

34
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>including zoroastrianism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an idea that that emerged across</v>

35
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.100
<v Speaker 1>a very long period of time that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake in the garden was the same as </v>

36
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the source of all evil.</v>

37
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>And as I've been trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the longest period of time,</v>

38
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>why in the world the manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's essentially a representation of a</v>

39
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 1>predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the snake.</v>

40
00:01:56.131 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>And the snake is associated with trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

41
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that in all likelihood is</v>

42
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>that we dwelt in trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:08.220
<v Speaker 1>And snakes like trees and they're around</v>
<v Speaker 1>trees and they can climb trees.</v>

44
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>And the snake was a typical Predator on </v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

45
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Speaker 1>on our ancient relatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

46
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>And so that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that that representation </v>

47
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.871
<v Speaker 1>makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's predators that lurk in the </v>

48
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:20.871
<v Speaker 1>garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

49
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Obviously if you interact with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wake you up.</v>

50
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Well they better wake you up because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't wake you up when you interact</v>

51
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get eaten.</v>

52
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably just as well to wake up</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though there's painful consequences</v>

53
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>associated with becoming conscious.</v>

54
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>And that manifests itself immediately in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of,</v>

55
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

56
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.280
<v Speaker 1>of Adam and eve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's this weird association.</v>

57
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:46.281
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very undeveloped in the biblical </v>

58
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:46.281
<v Speaker 1>stories that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

59
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are part and parcel of this line of</v>

60
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:52.281
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was more like a consequence of a </v>

61
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>cloud of mythological stories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded it.</v>

62
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>But the reason for that I think is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that what human beings we're </v>

63
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>trying to puzzle out was the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Predator.</v>

64
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on one level of analysis,</v>

65
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:07.381
<v Speaker 1>the predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that links along the ground </v>

66
00:03:07.381 --> 00:03:07.381
<v Speaker 1>and the threatens you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also it's the thing that's your more</v>

67
00:03:07.381 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>lending me and that wakes you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then that's one conceptualization of</v>

68
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:16.861
<v Speaker 1>Predator and fair enough you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify it and you can take </v>

69
00:03:16.861 --> 00:03:20.161
<v Speaker 1>precautionary measures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a better conceptualization of </v>

70
00:03:20.161 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Predator might be where does it come </v>
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>

71
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it's a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while there's a layer of snake </v>

72
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.681
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if we want to get rid of the </v>

73
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:31.741
<v Speaker 1>snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't be conceptualizing it as a </v>

74
00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:34.651
<v Speaker 1>snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should be conceptualizing it as one </v>

75
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of a layer of snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we should do is go down,</v>

76
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>follow the damn snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever it goes and find it's layer and</v>

77
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:42.740
<v Speaker 1>wipe out all of the snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

78
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 1>that's a more abstract representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not predatory anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the source of predation.</v>

80
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to solve the Predator</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem permanently,</v>

81
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>you don't kill the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get rid of all the snakes.</v>

82
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>

83
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are pretty damn good at that.</v>

84
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you have stories of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like St Patrick who chased all </v>

85
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.341
<v Speaker 1>the snakes out of Ireland and all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of saints were snake eradication saints.</v>

86
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of reasons for that,</v>

87
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 1>but then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

88
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>well the worst Predator is the layer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes,</v>

89
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.190
<v Speaker 1>But then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well wait a minute,</v>

91
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>the worst Predator isn't the layer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>

92
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the worst Predator is the enemies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that come to attack us.</v>

93
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>And those are human enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we do is we defend ourselves</v>

94
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>against the human enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put walls around our cities,</v>

95
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>we fortify our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our land,</v>

96
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 1>and we defend ourselves against the evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's lurking in other people's hearts.</v>

97
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.700
<v Speaker 1>And so that's like a higher order snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we build these walls around us </v>

98
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 1>and what's inside gets larger and larger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and larger.</v>

99
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.220
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens is the snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>started popping up inside the cities </v>

100
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we pushed all the.</v>

101
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.980
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've protected ourselves from all the </v>

102
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 1>evil that lurks outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've now created a space where that</v>

103
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 1>evil can manifest itself inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's criminals inside the city and</v>

104
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 1>there's people who want to bring you </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

105
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 1>And there's malevolence within the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only outside.</v>

106
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 1>So then there's the problem of the snake</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's closer to you,</v>

107
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.940
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the ultimate problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the snake that lives in your </v>

108
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.940
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

109
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's each individual's capacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>for evil.</v>

110
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>And then that was conceptualized as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent spirit,</v>

111
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the spirit of Satan who's the </v>

112
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.880
<v Speaker 1>WHO's the adversary of the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adversary of the hero,</v>

113
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 1>and that's why there's an association </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the snake in the garden.</v>

114
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 1>And this is great series of mythologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the existence of evil itself.</v>

115
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a consequence of our continued </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to abstract.</v>

116
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.190
<v Speaker 1>We started using the Predator detection </v>
<v Speaker 1>system to detect snakes and maybe no </v>

117
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 1>predatory cats and maybe birds of prey </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that,</v>

118
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.230
<v Speaker 1>but that didn't solve the bloody problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>because just because you hid from the </v>

119
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.281
<v Speaker 1>predatory bird today didn't mean the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody thing wasn't going to be back </v>

120
00:05:59.281 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow and tomorrow starts to matter.</v>

121
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>As you get smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then once you're on that pathway and</v>

122
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>you starting to think abstractly about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Predator,</v>

123
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.710
<v Speaker 1>the nature of what constitutes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Predator starts to become is because </v>

124
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to solve that across all </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations simultaneously.</v>

125
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.690
<v Speaker 1>It starts to become very much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstracted.</v>

126
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>It ends up being something like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

127
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>like an eternal personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the internal personality that has</v>

128
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>its effect on everyone all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and it's so.</v>

129
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting to see those ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they basically evolved.</v>

130
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 1>People did not understand those ideas as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they produced them.</v>

131
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all put forward in a massive </v>

132
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 1>mythological context and in a rich story</v>
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

133
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:45.371
<v Speaker 1>and the stories were as conscious as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>information got was never articulated </v>

134
00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>past the level of story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So remarkable.</v>

135
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely remarkable.</v>
