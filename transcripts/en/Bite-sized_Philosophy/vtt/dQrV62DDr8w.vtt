1
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Our daughter entered her life at 24 due </v>
<v Speaker 1>to depression.</v>

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.280
<v Speaker 1>If someone is determined to end their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

3
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>how can one change their mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:08.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

5
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm very sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible thing.</v>

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this friend her.</v>

7
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of depression in our </v>

8
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:43.161
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a question that comes close to </v>

9
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:43.161
<v Speaker 1>the bone.</v>

10
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this friend and friend of my </v>

11
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.180
<v Speaker 1>parents and her grand daughter committed</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>

12
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was just beating yourself up about </v>

13
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could have I done?</v>

14
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 1>What could've I done differently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem with suicide.</v>

15
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>It leaves everybody behind thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

16
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>what could have I done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have treated the person better.</v>

17
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>I could have listened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have been there.</v>

18
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was just beating yourself up </v>

19
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>about this really feeling that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a useful person,</v>

20
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>that she'd failed as a grandmother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a really good person,</v>

21
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:22.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I went for a walk with her and I </v>

22
00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:24.891
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's married and she likes her husband </v>

23
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>and he's a really good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

24
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

25
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.100
<v Speaker 1>you're blaming yourself for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your granddaughter,</v>

26
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:32.890
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

27
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.940
<v Speaker 1>are you blaming your husband?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sitting him down and telling </v>

28
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.331
<v Speaker 1>them what to use?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Useless bastard he was as a grandfather </v>

29
00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>because his grand daughter committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide and how he failed completely.</v>

30
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

31
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I'd never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

32
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it to yourself.</v>

33
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.770
<v Speaker 1>No people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depression was a terrible thing and </v>

34
00:01:57.961 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

35
00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>many things cause it and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

36
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.040
<v Speaker 1>We understand some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lots of them we don't understand at </v>

37
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.040
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people get depressed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really sick.</v>

39
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>We know that depression can be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory disease,</v>

40
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>it might be associated with autoimmune </v>
<v Speaker 1>dysfunction.</v>

41
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.510
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of reasons that people get </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and depressed.</v>

42
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>People can go places that are so dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just cannot imagine it.</v>

43
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't necessarily the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can always rescue someone,</v>

44
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

45
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but drowning yourself in the aftermath </v>

46
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.510
<v Speaker 1>of a suicide is not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>

47
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a good room for self forgiveness</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

48
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:39.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe you did some things you </v>

49
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:39.831
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have done that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible and all of that,</v>

50
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to beat yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the presumption of innocence,</v>

51
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:49.131
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Innocent until proven guilty and you </v>

52
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>have to apply that to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

53
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.270
<v Speaker 1>I think there are times when people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so depressed there.</v>

54
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.200
<v Speaker 1>There isn't anything that anyone can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

55
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.230
<v Speaker 1>when the depressed person thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is probably the worst part of </v>

56
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the depressed person thinks</v>

57
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.030
<v Speaker 1>everywhere I look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing but catastrophe and </v>

58
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any way out of it.</v>

59
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.210
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any path forward whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they think as well and maybe </v>

60
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>it's the combination of these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts that,</v>

61
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>that really make people suicidal so like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hopeless.</v>

62
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.190
<v Speaker 1>It isn't going to get any better no </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter where I turned.</v>

63
00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:31.191
<v Speaker 1>There's no escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The suffering is unbearable and I've </v>

64
00:03:31.191 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>absolutely no use whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do anyone.</v>

65
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 1>It would be better for everyone if I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just gone because I'm going,</v>

66
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not so much of a burden now that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to destroy their life,</v>

67
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to be that much of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>burden in the future,</v>

68
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>and so todd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagine what that's like for people,</v>

69
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:53.431
<v Speaker 1>but it's dreadful and there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways you get there and so you can listen</v>

70
00:03:55.481 --> 00:04:00.481
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can desperately encourage them to </v>

71
00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:00.481
<v Speaker 1>seek the help they need.</v>

72
00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:00.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've,</v>

73
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I've seen antidepressants work miracles </v>
<v Speaker 1>on very,</v>

74
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 1>very many people now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't work for everyone and they're</v>

75
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>not a panacea but they have side effects</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that,</v>

76
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 1>but one of the side effects of untreated</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression is that you kill yourself and</v>

77
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 1>there is no recovery from that and are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the probabilities actually rather high.</v>

78
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>So you can go to war with them about </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants.</v>

79
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 1>If the person can't get out of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and their and their suicidal.</v>

80
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:32.401
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they have to lose one month on </v>

81
00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:32.401
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll know,</v>

82
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might have to experiment longer </v>

83
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.790
<v Speaker 1>because it would depend on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>some people respond better to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes of antidepressants than the </v>

85
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

86
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.990
<v Speaker 1>it's worth having a war with someone if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in dire straits and they won't </v>

87
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 1>do everything they can to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ECT works.</v>

88
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Electric convulsive therapy works for </v>
<v Speaker 1>intractable depression.</v>

89
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible thing to contemplate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the modern versions of ect aren't.</v>

90
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>One flew over the cuckoo's nest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

91
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's no coming back from </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

92
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't clean.</v>

93
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.660
<v Speaker 1>You can't rescue everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get sick and they die,</v>

94
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.250
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes the way they die looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's depression.</v>

95
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Depression is a multifaceted phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be there for them.</v>

96
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.510
<v Speaker 1>You can listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can watch,</v>

97
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.650
<v Speaker 1>you can intervene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can try to understand,</v>

98
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.610
<v Speaker 1>you can hold them accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do all of those things but that,</v>

99
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.070
<v Speaker 1>but everyone has their own destiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>and you're not omnipotent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes a catastrophe will </v>

101
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:40.220
<v Speaker 1>curse like your daughters and</v>

102
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.050
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you should try to drag the </v>

103
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.321
<v Speaker 1>least amount of misery forward that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can once you recover from your grief.</v>

104
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
