1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.330
<v Speaker 1>You're in a class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's near the beginning of the semester.</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.510
<v Speaker 1>You write an exam or you handed in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>essay and you don't get the mark that </v>

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:08.510
<v Speaker 1>you desired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>so what are your options?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One option would be,</v>

5
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:15.351
<v Speaker 1>so you've hit an anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things didn't happen the way you wanted </v>

6
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>them to happen and so maybe you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>that was a boring and stupid class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

8
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 1>this gives me an excuse to get out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's not such a negative thing or </v>

9
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.291
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well I really better buckle down and </v>

10
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:27.291
<v Speaker 1>study and you just started to stay in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the class.</v>

11
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>So basically what you've done is </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintained your framework.</v>

12
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to work through this class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

13
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've decided to modify some of the sub</v>

14
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>routines that make up that frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

15
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:43.401
<v Speaker 1>well I should study more next time or I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to prioritize this class compared </v>

16
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:47.001
<v Speaker 1>to other classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a micro alteration within the </v>

17
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.030
<v Speaker 1>overarching framework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But another thing you can do is say to </v>

18
00:00:50.711 --> 00:00:52.120
<v Speaker 1>hell with the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just won't.</v>

19
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll just drop it.</v>

20
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.210
<v Speaker 1>And so the advantage to that is problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

21
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>The disadvantages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now you have a different problem </v>

22
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

23
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you drop the class,</v>

24
00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:05.680
<v Speaker 1>do you have another class that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>replace it with?</v>

25
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Is that a good way of dealing with micro</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure,</v>

26
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move up a level of analysis and throw</v>

27
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.110
<v Speaker 1>throughout the whole frame because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could also say,</v>

28
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:19.111
<v Speaker 1>well maybe I should just drop out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>university and maybe I should go hang </v>

29
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:19.111
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.540
<v Speaker 1>it's the same line of logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just taken up to a higher degree of</v>

32
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:27.541
<v Speaker 1>abstraction and so generally speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to solve a problem by </v>

33
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>moving up a level in wiping out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame within which the problem was </v>

34
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.330
<v Speaker 1>experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to do that carefully?</v>

35
00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:39.331
<v Speaker 1>Because in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frame that you were working within </v>

36
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>had already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd already assigned value to it and </v>

37
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>worked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've already invested in it.</v>

38
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a big sacrifice to blow out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole frame.</v>

39
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Now sometimes you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

40
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.540
<v Speaker 1>what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

41
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.690
<v Speaker 1>you get the bad grade and you're upset </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

42
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.530
<v Speaker 1>and so you've been plunged from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>

43
00:01:56.531 --> 00:02:00.250
<v Speaker 1>satiated state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say into a state of relative chaos</v>

44
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.260
<v Speaker 1>and the chaos is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

45
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I hit an obstacle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't expect it and now I don't know </v>

46
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.861
<v Speaker 1>what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what does it mean to not know </v>

47
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:10.861
<v Speaker 1>what to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>it can mean I need to study harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can mean I should drop this course.</v>

49
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>It can mean I should major in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different subject.</v>

50
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe I shouldn't be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

51
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>It could mean maybe my future plans have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been formulated badly.</v>

52
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:30.951
<v Speaker 1>It can mean my future plans had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated badly because I don't </v>

53
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>understand myself very well and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been telling lies about my past.</v>

54
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing can really expand on you and </v>

55
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.601
<v Speaker 1>that's what the chaotic domain is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real manifestation of those </v>

56
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 1>things that you had considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant,</v>

57
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you go to pick up the exam,</v>

58
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.070
<v Speaker 1>you've got your identity as a competent </v>
<v Speaker 1>student intact.</v>

59
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.080
<v Speaker 1>You're not questioning whether you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be in the course or whether you </v>

60
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>should be in that major or whether you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be in university.</v>

61
00:02:55.201 --> 00:03:00.201
<v Speaker 1>None of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all in the implicitly accepted </v>

62
00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 1>category and as soon as the anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 1>event emerges,</v>

63
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.560
<v Speaker 1>all of those things that you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>rendered axiomatic start to become </v>

64
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>questionable and that's like the shark </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up out,</v>

65
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:15.961
<v Speaker 1>coming up from the depths to pull you </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and that's the classic way of </v>

66
00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>representing that and symbolizing it.</v>

67
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.870
<v Speaker 1>That's Jonah and the whale for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's something is manifested itself </v>

68
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>from the deep unknown and pulls you </v>
<v Speaker 1>under like an alligator at a,</v>

69
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.570
<v Speaker 1>at a waterhole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I'm sure one of the sources </v>

70
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.691
<v Speaker 1>from which we derived that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of mythological representation </v>

71
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>because you could imagine that when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were on the velt after living on trees,</v>

72
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>we had to go down to the dam water holes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've.</v>

73
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>You've watched enough nature programs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what a denial crocodile can do to a</v>

74
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 1>water buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not pretty.</v>

75
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.370
<v Speaker 1>And so to go down to the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaotic water and the source of all </v>

76
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>life as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

77
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>is to risk an encounter with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing that lurks in the depths.</v>

78
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 1>And so we use that as a central metaphor</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

79
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.820
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for mapping the sorts of things that </v>

80
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.461
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to us in a much more abstract </v>

81
00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:07.561
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know that because one of the </v>

82
00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 1>things you're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that the,</v>

83
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the professor,</v>

84
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a professor obviously who gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>you the bad grade,</v>

85
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.100
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one logical presupposition is that </v>

86
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 1>you're in some sense insufficient in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the course.</v>

87
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.870
<v Speaker 1>But another logical and instantaneous </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorization is to throw that person </v>

88
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 1>into the category of malevolent </v>
<v Speaker 1>Predator.</v>

89
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 1>And you'll do that by becoming upset and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cursing the person in your imagination.</v>
