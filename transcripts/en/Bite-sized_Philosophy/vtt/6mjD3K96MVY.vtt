1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>We've got a hypothesis that we're still </v>
<v Speaker 1>working out that supported to some </v>

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.961
<v Speaker 1>degree by the relevant literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you're looking for a </v>

3
00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:08.961
<v Speaker 1>stable partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
<v Speaker 1>So you might think well what do you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a stable partner and at least in </v>

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.771
<v Speaker 1>principle one of the things you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want is too much mismatch between you </v>

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>and that person on the five fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions.</v>

7
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.590
<v Speaker 1>So for example if you're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroverted and you have a really </v>

8
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.441
<v Speaker 1>introverted partner you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in continual conflict about how </v>

9
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:35.511
<v Speaker 1>much social activity the two of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should should be should should what </v>

10
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.180
<v Speaker 1>subject yourself to and it's very very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult for people who broadly differ </v>

11
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.831
<v Speaker 1>widely differ on those dimensions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to consensus because it's not just </v>

12
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>a matter of opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right it's really a matter of different.</v>

13
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking at extremes of really </v>
<v Speaker 1>different types of people then the thing</v>

14
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:58.401
<v Speaker 1>about introverts is they just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy large scale social interaction </v>

15
00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:59.920
<v Speaker 1>much one on one they're often fine.</v>

16
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.970
<v Speaker 1>But in a group they don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it tires them out whereas a real </v>

17
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.751
<v Speaker 1>extrovert it's like you isolate them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just wither on the vine because a </v>

18
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:13.011
<v Speaker 1>huge part of what actually motivates </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a positive way is tangled up </v>

19
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>with social interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're an agreeable person and</v>

20
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:21.711
<v Speaker 1>you have a particularly disagreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner you're also going to run into </v>

21
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:25.101
<v Speaker 1>problems because the agreeable person </v>
<v Speaker 1>will say whatever you want whenever and </v>

22
00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:29.421
<v Speaker 1>the agreeable disagreeable person will </v>
<v Speaker 1>say Well I'd like to know what the hell </v>

23
00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:33.381
<v Speaker 1>you want for a change and be much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>harsh and much more demanding in the </v>

24
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:37.521
<v Speaker 1>situation and the agreeable person is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to find the disagreeable person </v>

25
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:41.541
<v Speaker 1>harsh and unpleasant and disagreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>person is going to find the agreeable </v>

26
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>person wishy washy and unable to stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>up for themselves.</v>

27
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 1>And again that's that's actually one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the primary sources of tension between </v>

28
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Speaker 1>men and women because women tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher in agreeableness than men.</v>

29
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>It's about half a standard deviation </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite quite quite quite a large</v>

30
00:01:56.521 --> 00:02:01.521
<v Speaker 1>difference by psychological standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means I probably </v>

31
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 1>haven't got this statistic quite right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think I've got it about right.</v>

32
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.500
<v Speaker 1>What that means fundamentally just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have some sense of how large the </v>

33
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>effect that is is that if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of men and women and you pick out </v>

34
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.021
<v Speaker 1>random pairs the woman is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more agreeable than the man 60 percent </v>

35
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not an overwhelming proportion</v>

36
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's a reliable and it's quite it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite large.</v>

37
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.040
<v Speaker 1>By psychological standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the problem with </v>

38
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.371
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness with conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if you're conscientious you're </v>

39
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:38.931
<v Speaker 1>industrious and orderly and orderly </v>
<v Speaker 1>people seem to be sensitive to disgust </v>

40
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>which is something we'll talk about in </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail later.</v>

41
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
<v Speaker 1>We've had a hard time specifying exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes industrious people </v>

42
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.591
<v Speaker 1>industrious because it's hard to come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an animal model for that sort of </v>

43
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:51.591
<v Speaker 1>thing and there's no theoretical model.</v>

44
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:56.510
<v Speaker 1>But our latest idea is that it's not my </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea it's actually the idea of my </v>

45
00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:01.761
<v Speaker 1>graduate student Christine Brophy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that industrious people find it </v>

46
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.840
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant and unsettling to not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something.</v>

47
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.320
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't so much that industriousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes them happy or fills them with </v>

48
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.161
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be more extraversion right </v>

49
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:16.161
<v Speaker 1>because extroversion is the positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion to mention.</v>

50
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:20.190
<v Speaker 1>It's that industrious people can't stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting around doing nothing.</v>

51
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.520
<v Speaker 1>And you know this is speculation but you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know human beings are obviously always </v>

52
00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:31.191
<v Speaker 1>engaged in the exchange of labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the reciprocal exchange of </v>

53
00:03:31.191 --> 00:03:35.001
<v Speaker 1>labor and you can imagine that in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>community where everyone knows everyone.</v>

54
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.760
<v Speaker 1>The people who work hard are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty irritated on a fairly chronic </v>

55
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.610
<v Speaker 1>basis with the people who are completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>unproductive.</v>

56
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.970
<v Speaker 1>And my suspicions are that plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are completely unproductive </v>

57
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.381
<v Speaker 1>in the history of our of the evolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our species were wiped out by people </v>

58
00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:53.730
<v Speaker 1>who were unhappy with their lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity.</v>

59
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.760
<v Speaker 1>And so I think generally speaking human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have this sense of ethical </v>

60
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.591
<v Speaker 1>obligation with regards to one another </v>
<v Speaker 1>to share labor and people who are </v>

61
00:04:03.591 --> 00:04:08.361
<v Speaker 1>conscientious really really feel that so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel bad if they're not busily </v>

62
00:04:08.361 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>working on something that's productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

63
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>And so the advantage to being with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone conscientious is well they're </v>

64
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.791
<v Speaker 1>going to work like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the disadvantages there they're </v>

65
00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:22.640
<v Speaker 1>going to work like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know if you're looking for a </v>

66
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.551
<v Speaker 1>partner that you want to relax with or </v>
<v Speaker 1>have fun with or who isn't uptight then </v>

67
00:04:25.551 --> 00:04:27.210
<v Speaker 1>a conscientious person is probably not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good choice.</v>

68
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.600
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious person and you're living </v>

69
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.961
<v Speaker 1>with someone who's really an </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious that's good because they </v>

70
00:04:35.961 --> 00:04:38.901
<v Speaker 1>might be able to help you relax but </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be happy with them </v>

71
00:04:38.901 --> 00:04:38.901
<v Speaker 1>because they don't work nearly as hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you do.</v>

72
00:04:38.901 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>But even worse on the orderly dimension </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know some of you have had roommates </v>

73
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you're more orderly than your </v>
<v Speaker 1>roommate.</v>

74
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.510
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Means you're annoyed by mass before they</v>

75
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:55.641
<v Speaker 1>are and you don't have to be annoyed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass much before you're less orderly </v>

76
00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:58.650
<v Speaker 1>roommate for you to be the one that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>always running around picking things up.</v>

77
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>And so actually one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerged from the psychometric analysis </v>

78
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.941
<v Speaker 1>is that women are slightly more orderly </v>
<v Speaker 1>than man and I suspect that has </v>

79
00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:12.051
<v Speaker 1>something to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you call it inequitable </v>

80
00:05:12.051 --> 00:05:15.231
<v Speaker 1>distribution of housework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because even if your imagine that your </v>

81
00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:18.690
<v Speaker 1>proclivity is to be triggered by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder twenty five seconds before your</v>

82
00:05:18.691 --> 00:05:23.691
<v Speaker 1>partner's well you're going to end up it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't take much difference for you to </v>

83
00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:25.440
<v Speaker 1>be the one that's always concerned about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mess first.</v>

84
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.980
<v Speaker 1>So anyways and so if you're a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly person and you live with a </v>

85
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.980
<v Speaker 1>disorderly person.</v>

86
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Well good luck getting along with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to regard you as like </v>

87
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.810
<v Speaker 1>uptight and and overconcerned with </v>
<v Speaker 1>details.</v>

88
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.420
<v Speaker 1>And and well and unwilling to relax </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure and they're going to </v>

89
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:49.521
<v Speaker 1>regard you as well just a bloody mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how can anyone possibly live with </v>

90
00:05:49.521 --> 00:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>someone like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

91
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.050
<v Speaker 1>So another reason why it's useful to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand your personality is because I</v>

92
00:05:55.051 --> 00:06:00.051
<v Speaker 1>think it gives you a better crack at </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding someone that you can actually </v>

93
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:03.240
<v Speaker 1>live with over the long run and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what the optimal.</v>

94
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you want to live with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who is exactly like you.</v>

95
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Because then both of you have the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengths and weaknesses and there's a </v>

96
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 1>bit of a problem there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

97
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe an agreeable person can </v>
<v Speaker 1>use a bit of disagreeable person around </v>

98
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.580
<v Speaker 1>them to balance each other out and vice </v>
<v Speaker 1>versa.</v>

99
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't understand the optimal </v>

100
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.840
<v Speaker 1>balance for for a long term thriving in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a relationship.</v>

101
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.880
<v Speaker 1>But I think we do understand the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you're too different in your </v>

102
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.960
<v Speaker 1>traits that where you are different is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to constitute a chronic source of.</v>

103
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Conflict.</v>
