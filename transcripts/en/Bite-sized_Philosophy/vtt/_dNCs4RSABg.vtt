1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to read you some things </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Friedman who wrote the </v>

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:05.170
<v Speaker 1>disappearance of God.</v>

3
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.950
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to look at the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the stories.</v>

4
00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friedman noted that the books in the Old</v>

5
00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Testament were written by a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different people at very different times</v>

6
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.330
<v Speaker 1>and then they were sequenced by other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people for reasons that we don't exactly</v>

7
00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:27.331
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still an underlying </v>

8
00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:31.351
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's multiple underlying narrative </v>

9
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:32.740
<v Speaker 1>unity's despite the fact of that rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary sequencing,</v>

10
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.230
<v Speaker 1>and that's a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

11
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:38.920
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could say if you had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>collection of ancient books and you were</v>

12
00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 1>trying to put them together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to put them together in some way</v>

13
00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:43.750
<v Speaker 1>that made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

14
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:48.751
<v Speaker 1>and it wouldn't make sense unless you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stumbled across some kind of underlying </v>

15
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 1>narrative that allowed you to order </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

16
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>and so it's not entirely surprising that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're ordered in a manner that's </v>

17
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Friedman's comments on the </v>

18
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.950
<v Speaker 1>underlying narrative structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it was,</v>

19
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go through this.</v>

20
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>The books of the Old Testament were </v>
<v Speaker 1>composed by a great many authors </v>

21
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.930
<v Speaker 1>according to both traditional religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>views and modern critical scholarship,</v>

22
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenon of the diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparent presence of God across so many </v>

23
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.951
<v Speaker 1>stories through so many books by so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>authors spread over so many centuries is</v>

24
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:21.860
<v Speaker 1>consistent enough to be striking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive and ultimately mysterious,</v>

25
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.690
<v Speaker 1>but the hiding of the divine phase is </v>
<v Speaker 1>only half the story.</v>

26
00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:31.691
<v Speaker 1>There's another development also </v>
<v Speaker 1>extending across the course of the </v>

27
00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.811
<v Speaker 1>entire narrative of the Hebrew Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we must see before we can </v>

28
00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:38.291
<v Speaker 1>appreciate the full force of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena and before we can pose the </v>

29
00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:39.200
<v Speaker 1>solution to the mystery of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how this happened.</v>

30
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Gradually from genesis to Ezra and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is a transition from divine </v>

31
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 1>to human responsibility for life on </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

32
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>The story begins in genesis with God in </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete control of the creation,</v>

33
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.470
<v Speaker 1>but by the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans have arrived at a stage at which </v>

34
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.260
<v Speaker 1>in all apparent ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have responsibility for the fate of</v>

35
00:01:57.261 --> 00:02:00.110
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first two human beings,</v>

36
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Adam and eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take little responsibility themselves.</v>

37
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.490
<v Speaker 1>They do not design or build anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're embarrassed over their </v>

38
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.490
<v Speaker 1>nudity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do not make clothes.</v>

39
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>They cover themselves with leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's God who makes their first clothing </v>

40
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>

41
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.400
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm by no means a fully developed </v>

42
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.400
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

43
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.280
<v Speaker 1>it is not an every man either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Broadly speaking,</v>

44
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:25.970
<v Speaker 1>he reflects a step beyond Adam and eve </v>
<v Speaker 1>and human character and responsibility.</v>

45
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond that counts of divine commands </v>

46
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.100
<v Speaker 1>that Abraham does carry out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The narrative also includes a variety of</v>

47
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:36.890
<v Speaker 1>stories in which Abraham acts on his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>initiative.</v>

48
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 1>He divides land with his nephew lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He battles kings.</v>

49
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:42.740
<v Speaker 1>He takes concubines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He argued with his wife Sarah.</v>

50
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>On two occasions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tells kings that Sarah,</v>

51
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.580
<v Speaker 1>his sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of fear,</v>

52
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:50.240
<v Speaker 1>that they will kill him to get his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he arranges his son's marriage.</v>

53
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.910
<v Speaker 1>In the place of the single story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Noah's drunkenness,</v>

54
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:54.470
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the case of Abraham,</v>

55
00:02:54.471 --> 00:02:58.370
<v Speaker 1>the stories of man's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Abraham section that's developed the</v>

56
00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>personality and of a man of man to a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree in biblical narrative,</v>

57
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>while picturing in him a new degree of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

58
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>It is not just that Abraham has kindler </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinder,</v>

59
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>gentler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more intrepid,</v>

60
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:14.011
<v Speaker 1>more ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a better debater than his ancestor </v>

61
00:03:14.011 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>noah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather both the Noah and Abraham stories</v>

62
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:19.921
<v Speaker 1>or pieces of a development of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly stronger stance of humans </v>

63
00:03:19.921 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>relative to the day before the story is </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

64
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Humans will become a great deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger and bolder than Abraham.</v>

65
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

66
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.870
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't.</v>

67
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.180
<v Speaker 1>It is certainly the case that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual exists in the modern world,</v>

68
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.510
<v Speaker 1>the differentiated self aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self conscious individual,</v>

69
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.660
<v Speaker 1>and it's certainly the case that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the case at some point in the </v>

70
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.260
<v Speaker 1>past and so it's the case that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a development,</v>

71
00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you could call it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>progression,</v>

72
00:03:57.331 --> 00:04:02.331
<v Speaker 1>but a development of the autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual over some span of historical </v>

73
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:04.590
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't know how long that's been,</v>

74
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:07.440
<v Speaker 1>but my suspicions are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't been that long.</v>

75
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

76
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.970
<v Speaker 1>I read once about a Neolithic ceremony </v>
<v Speaker 1>that involve the particular placement of</v>

77
00:04:17.821 --> 00:04:22.821
<v Speaker 1>a bear skull in a cave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I read that and they had found </v>

78
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.570
<v Speaker 1>these placements in caves that were at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least 25,000</v>

79
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:32.571
<v Speaker 1>years old and then I read that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>found caves in Japan among the Ainu who </v>

80
00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:36.771
<v Speaker 1>were the indigenous inhabitants of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese territory and rather archaic </v>

81
00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:41.181
<v Speaker 1>people who had the same ceremony with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bear and that put the skull in the </v>

82
00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:45.831
<v Speaker 1>same orientation and place in caves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that tradition remained unbroken </v>

83
00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:47.970
<v Speaker 1>for about 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

84
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.070
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

85
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.110
<v Speaker 1>is it possible for an oral or ritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition to remain on broken for spans </v>

86
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.850
<v Speaker 1>of tens of thousands of years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is not only is it</v>

87
00:04:56.851 --> 00:04:59.970
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually the norm because like</v>

88
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.470
<v Speaker 1>one chimpanzee is like the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee,</v>

89
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the progression,</v>

90
00:05:05.121 --> 00:05:10.121
<v Speaker 1>in the biological progression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you took a chimpanzee troop now and </v>

91
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:13.781
<v Speaker 1>you went back 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and you looked at a chimpanzee </v>

92
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:13.781
<v Speaker 1>troop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be the same thing.</v>

93
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:17.621
<v Speaker 1>There's no historical progression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you can tell the chimps </v>

94
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:19.700
<v Speaker 1>really don't have culture because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could even create one,</v>

95
00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:24.230
<v Speaker 1>1000th of a percent of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmissible culture progeneration,</v>

96
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.350
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't take more than about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years before they'd have a whole</v>

97
00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:31.790
<v Speaker 1>civilization and they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the same as they were and so the</v>

98
00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:36.791
<v Speaker 1>continuity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stability and unchanging nature of </v>

99
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:40.271
<v Speaker 1>his species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially speaking is the rule that </v>

100
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 1>the variant is us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the hell happened after </v>

101
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.430
<v Speaker 1>the last ice age?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen thousand years ago,</v>

102
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.760
<v Speaker 1>we went from tribal uniform stable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell we are now.</v>

103
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.710
<v Speaker 1>It's this transition from</v>

104
00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.030
<v Speaker 1>generic too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and I can't </v>

105
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.821
<v Speaker 1>help but think that that's reflected in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this text and it has something to do </v>

106
00:06:03.821 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>with this transition of consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

107
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 1>from what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>From possession by the generic divine to</v>

108
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>dominance by this specific individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

109
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Is that a neurological transformation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what this is a record of been?</v>

110
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.980
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you said about God </v>

111
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.561
<v Speaker 1>because human relationship with God as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an object of belief is very complex.</v>

112
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 1>He in his technical writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he always talks about the image of God.</v>

113
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>He never talks about God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talks about the image of God.</v>

114
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 1>He said that the image of God dwells </v>
<v Speaker 1>within us,</v>

115
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>not the same thing as God dwelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>within.</v>

116
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we could mean all of these </v>

117
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.580
<v Speaker 1>capacities that we have for transcendent</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness could be a byproduct of </v>

118
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.640
<v Speaker 1>biological evolution that could have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection.</v>

119
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:54.641
<v Speaker 1>They can have no relationship whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 1>to an actual transcendent reality.</v>

120
00:06:54.801 --> 00:06:59.801
<v Speaker 1>There's no way of telling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent reality seems to manifest </v>

121
00:06:59.801 --> 00:07:03.371
<v Speaker 1>itself as an element of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that it has in </v>

122
00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:06.041
<v Speaker 1>reality outside of this objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's even if it exists as it </v>

123
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:07.270
<v Speaker 1>clearly does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

124
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Friedman suggests that what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the biblical narrative is the </v>

125
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.921
<v Speaker 1>sequential emergence of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a redemptive force and that the old </v>

126
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:34.151
<v Speaker 1>testament documents that implicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously as a consequence of </v>

127
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.210
<v Speaker 1>descriptive fantasy and that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in the book and that so </v>

128
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 1>the Cosmos is under the control of </v>
<v Speaker 1>generic daddy to begin with.</v>

129
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:51.401
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that controls shifts to </v>

130
00:07:51.401 --> 00:07:56.140
<v Speaker 1>localized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiable increasingly personal and </v>

131
00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.251
<v Speaker 1>detailed individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see that in Noah and then you </v>

132
00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:01.650
<v Speaker 1>see the neighborhood and then you see it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Moses,</v>

133
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.340
<v Speaker 1>and then there's this working out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it would mean to be a fully </v>

134
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.760
<v Speaker 1>developed individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what these stories,</v>

135
00:08:08.761 --> 00:08:10.410
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>

136
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.580
<v Speaker 1>they're like prototypes there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are attempts to to to bring about </v>

137
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.121
<v Speaker 1>the proper motive being right and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham is a is a manifestation of that </v>

138
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:21.270
<v Speaker 1>because he enters into a covenant with </v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

139
00:08:21.271 --> 00:08:23.880
<v Speaker 1>He's selected by God or interesting to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>partnership with God.</v>

140
00:08:23.881 --> 00:08:28.881
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God provides him with forward motion and</v>

141
00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:34.701
<v Speaker 1>intuition and leads them towards a </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful mode of being.</v>

142
00:08:35.011 --> 00:08:36.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful motive being.</v>

143
00:08:36.841 --> 00:08:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Because Abraham is a very complex life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of ups and downs,</v>

144
00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:40.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

145
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not unbroken</v>

146
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.660
<v Speaker 1>security of being towards the divine </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

147
00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:51.661
<v Speaker 1>Abraham lies and cheats and deceives and</v>
<v Speaker 1>does all sorts of things that that a </v>

148
00:08:51.661 --> 00:08:54.430
<v Speaker 1>real person would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and Moses for example,</v>

149
00:08:54.431 --> 00:08:59.431
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these people that the biblical </v>

150
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 1>people are very genuine individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're given with all their faults,</v>

151
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all their sins,</v>

152
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:08.481
<v Speaker 1>with all their deceit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still put forth as potential </v>

153
00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>modes of proper models of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper being in the world.</v>

154
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.640
<v Speaker 1>And the entire Corpus of the Bible seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be nothing but an attempt to keep </v>

155
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.591
<v Speaker 1>throwing up variance of the personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to experiment to find out what </v>

156
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 1>personality works in the world.</v>
