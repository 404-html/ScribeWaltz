1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.350
<v Speaker 1>We're having a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm deciding I'm going to listen to you.</v>

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's different than how people </v>

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>generally communicate because usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they communicate,</v>

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>they're doing something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.050
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have a conversation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you why I'm right and </v>

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.101
<v Speaker 1>all win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you agree or maybe you're having a </v>

7
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>conversation where I don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do,</v>

8
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:28.041
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're trying to impress the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person you're talking to so you're not </v>

9
00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:30.681
<v Speaker 1>listening to them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just thinking about what you're </v>

10
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:30.681
<v Speaker 1>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say Next.</v>

11
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:30.681
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's not this.</v>

12
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:35.600
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might have something to tell me and </v>

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to listen on the off chance</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll tell me something that would</v>

14
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:43.911
<v Speaker 1>really be useful for me to know and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take about it as an as an </v>

15
00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:48.081
<v Speaker 1>extension of the Piagetian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget talked about the fundamental,</v>

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.500
<v Speaker 1>the fundamentally important element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge being to describe how </v>

17
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.681
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is sought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process by which knowledge is </v>

18
00:00:57.681 --> 00:00:57.681
<v Speaker 1>generated.</v>

19
00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you agree with me and I find that </v>

20
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know nothing more than I knew before.</v>

21
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.470
<v Speaker 1>I just know what I knew before hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe unhappy about that because it </v>

22
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 1>didn't get challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm no smarter than I was before,</v>

23
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.350
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you're different than me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so while I'm listening to you,</v>

24
00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:13.440
<v Speaker 1>you'll tell me something I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like.</v>

25
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's something I find contemptible</v>
<v Speaker 1>or difficult,</v>

26
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:21.591
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll find you'll tell me </v>

27
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:23.631
<v Speaker 1>something I don't know and then I won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be quite as stupid and then maybe I </v>

28
00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>won't run painfully into quite as many </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

29
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really useful thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

30
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:32.841
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you live with someone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to make longterm piece </v>

31
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:34.840
<v Speaker 1>with them as they are not the same as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and they're away.</v>

32
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>They look at the world and the facts </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they pull out of the world aren't </v>

33
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.381
<v Speaker 1>the same as your facts and even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be overwhelmed with the </v>

34
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>proclivity to demonstrate that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

35
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>it is the case.</v>

36
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>The two brains are better than one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so maybe nine of the 10 things they </v>

37
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>tell you are dispensable or maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 1>49 out of 50,</v>

38
00:01:56.041 --> 00:02:01.041
<v Speaker 1>but one thing all you need to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the damn conversation is one thing you </v>

39
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:05.121
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's very cool </v>

40
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:07.821
<v Speaker 1>about a good psychotherapeutic session </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the whole conversation is like </v>

41
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:12.591
<v Speaker 1>that all you're doing is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>express the truth of the situation as </v>

42
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>clearly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

43
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 1>And so now rogers' proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you why he derived it,</v>

44
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>was that if you have a conversation like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that with someone,</v>

45
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.640
<v Speaker 1>it will make both of you better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will make both of you with </v>

46
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 1>psychologically healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an implicit presupposition </v>

47
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.710
<v Speaker 1>that the exchange of truth is curative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:42.710
<v Speaker 1>that's a very cool idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

49
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a very deep idea.</v>

50
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the most profound idea.</v>

51
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.310
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the idea upon western civil upon </v>

52
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>which Western civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although not only Western civilization,</v>

53
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>is actually predicated the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth produces health.</v>

54
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>But for Rogers that was entire purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the psycho therapeutic alliance.</v>

55
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>You come to see me because you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be better.</v>

56
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily.</v>

57
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Neither do I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to figure that out together,</v>

58
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>but you come and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

59
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>things are not acceptable to me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something I could do about</v>

60
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:21.181
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the minimal precondition to </v>

61
00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:21.181
<v Speaker 1>engage in therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's wrong.</v>

62
00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>You're willing to talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>truthfully and you want it to be better.</v>

63
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Without that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the therapeutic relationship does not </v>

64
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>get off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might ask,</v>

65
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:34.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what relationships are therapeutic and </v>

66
00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:37.081
<v Speaker 1>answered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be if you have a real </v>

67
00:03:37.081 --> 00:03:37.081
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's therapeutic.</v>

68
00:03:37.081 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>If it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have is not a relationship.</v>

69
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a slave,</v>

70
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.590
<v Speaker 1>they're a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're both butting heads with </v>

71
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.651
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a primate dominance hierarchy </v>

72
00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:49.651
<v Speaker 1>dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

73
00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:53.431
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like two cats in a barrel or two </v>

74
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:53.431
<v Speaker 1>people with their hands around each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other's throats.</v>

75
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>But what you have is not a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So alright,</v>

76
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 1>we may say that the greater the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicated congruence of experience,</v>

77
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>awareness and behavior on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one individual,</v>

78
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 1>that's a reference to the same idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was describing with regards to yoke.</v>

79
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you come and talk to me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want things to go,</v>

80
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:17.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm going to have to more or less </v>

81
00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:17.221
<v Speaker 1>be one thing because if I'm all over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

82
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>you can't trust any continuity in what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

83
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 1>There's no end.</v>

84
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason for you to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm capable of actually telling you</v>

85
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm capable of expressing anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

86
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.440
<v Speaker 1>So the truth is something that emerges </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequences of getting yourself </v>

87
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.251
<v Speaker 1>lined up and beating all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you call all the impurities </v>

88
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 1>out of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of your,</v>

89
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 1>out of your soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word.</v>

90
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.930
<v Speaker 1>You have to be integrated for that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and you do that at least in part </v>

91
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.051
<v Speaker 1>by wanting to tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more the ensuing relationship will </v>

92
00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 1>involve a tendency towards reciprocal </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication with the same qualities.</v>

93
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite influenced by Rogers,</v>

94
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.230
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I tried to do in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic sessions is first of all to </v>

95
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 1>listen to really listen and then we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I listen,</v>

96
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I watch and well I'm listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things will happen in my head,</v>

97
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll get a little image of </v>

98
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.521
<v Speaker 1>something or I'll get a thought or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>question will emerge and then I'll just </v>

99
00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:20.521
<v Speaker 1>tell the person what that is.</v>

100
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>But it's sort of directionless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

101
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I have a goal except that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to make things better.</v>

102
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the side of the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the side of the part of the </v>

103
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>person that wants things to be better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not worse.</v>

104
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.650
<v Speaker 1>And so then those parts of us have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue and the consequence of that </v>

105
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>dialogue is that certain things take </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and then I'll just tell the person</v>

106
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:42.400
<v Speaker 1>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't that I'm right.</v>

107
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.490
<v Speaker 1>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>

108
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:49.491
<v Speaker 1>is that they get to have an hour where </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone actually tells them what they </v>

109
00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the impact you're having on me.</v>

110
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is making me angry,</v>

111
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>this is making me happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really interesting.</v>

112
00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.380
<v Speaker 1>This reminds me of something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said an hour ago that I don't quite </v>

113
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.380
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole,</v>

114
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.970
<v Speaker 1>the whole point is not for either person</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the proposition or convinced the</v>

115
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:12.521
<v Speaker 1>other that their position is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but merely to have an exchange of </v>

116
00:06:12.521 --> 00:06:17.381
<v Speaker 1>experience about how things are set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's extraordinarily useful for </v>

117
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:22.571
<v Speaker 1>people because it's often difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone to find anyone to talk to that </v>

118
00:06:22.571 --> 00:06:22.571
<v Speaker 1>will actually listen.</v>

119
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.090
<v Speaker 1>And so another thing that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange about this listening is that if </v>

120
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.301
<v Speaker 1>you listen to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will tell you the weirdest bloody </v>

121
00:06:31.301 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 1>things so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just cannot believe it.</v>

122
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>So if you're having a conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone and it's dull,</v>

123
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.700
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're not listening to them </v>

124
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.841
<v Speaker 1>properly because they're weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like wombats or albatrosses or </v>

125
00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 1>rhinoceroses or something like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange creatures.</v>

126
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.520
<v Speaker 1>And so if you are actually communicating</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them and they were telling you how </v>

127
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>weird they really are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be.</v>

128
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>It would be anything but boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

129
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.040
<v Speaker 1>And you can ask questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good way of listening,</v>

130
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>but you know one of Roger's points as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

131
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:06.101
<v Speaker 1>You have to be oriented properly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to listen and the orientation has </v>

132
00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:09.761
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what I want out of this </v>

133
00:07:09.761 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 1>conversation is that the place we both </v>
<v Speaker 1>end up is better than the place we left.</v>

134
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm after,</v>

135
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 1>and if you're not after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to think,</v>

136
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.600
<v Speaker 1>why the hell wouldn't you be after that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could you possibly be after that </v>

137
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.801
<v Speaker 1>would be better than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk away smarter and more well </v>

138
00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 1>equipped for the world than you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you had the conversation,</v>

139
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.910
<v Speaker 1>and so does the other person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

140
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:32.350
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you're bitter and resentful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry and anxious and you know,</v>

141
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.140
<v Speaker 1>generally annoyed at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that isn't what you want.</v>

142
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 1>You want the other person to walk away </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse and Youtube because you're full of</v>

143
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 1>revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know you'll get what you want if</v>

144
00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:48.401
<v Speaker 1>you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know from our research that such </v>

145
00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>empathic understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so already defined that.</v>

146
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear what you have to say so </v>

147
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:55.900
<v Speaker 1>we can clarify it and move forward.</v>

148
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.640
<v Speaker 1>I want to have your best interests in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and mine as well,</v>

149
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.030
<v Speaker 1>but you know both at the same time your </v>
<v Speaker 1>families too.</v>

150
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 1>If we could manage that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're after making things better.</v>

151
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.480
<v Speaker 1>We know from our research that such </v>
<v Speaker 1>empathic understanding,</v>

152
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 1>understanding with a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not about him.</v>

153
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:15.701
<v Speaker 1>It's such an effective approach that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can bring about major changes in </v>

154
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:18.611
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you may be feeling that you </v>

155
00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:19.340
<v Speaker 1>listen well to people and that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen such results.</v>

156
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.490
<v Speaker 1>The chances are very great that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>not been listening in the manner that </v>

157
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I've described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>

158
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:29.861
<v Speaker 1>I can suggest a little experiment that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do to test the quality of your </v>

159
00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:33.851
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next time you get into an argument </v>

160
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:34.130
<v Speaker 1>with your wife or your friend or a small</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of friends,</v>

161
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:38.150
<v Speaker 1>stop the discussion for a moment and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>an experiment institute this rule.</v>

162
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Each person can speak up for himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>only after he has first restated the </v>

163
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.061
<v Speaker 1>ideas and feelings of the previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaker accurately would accurately </v>

164
00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:51.380
<v Speaker 1>means is they have to agree with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>restatement.</v>

165
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an annoying thing to do because </v>

166
00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:56.830
<v Speaker 1>if someone is talking to you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree with them,</v>

167
00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you want to do is take </v>
<v Speaker 1>their argument,</v>

168
00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 1>make the stupidest possible thing out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it that you can.</v>

169
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the straw man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then demolish it.</v>

170
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like so then you can walk away </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling good about it and you primate </v>

171
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.850
<v Speaker 1>diamonds dominated them really nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

172
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

173
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:18.741
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm going to take what you told me </v>

174
00:09:18.741 --> 00:09:18.741
<v Speaker 1>and maybe I'm even going to make your </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument stronger than the one you made.</v>

175
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.930
<v Speaker 1>That's useful if you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that you have to live with </v>

176
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:24.420
<v Speaker 1>because maybe they can't bloody well </v>
<v Speaker 1>express themselves very well,</v>

177
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:28.410
<v Speaker 1>but they have something to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you make their argument strong.</v>

178
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you see what this would mean.</v>

179
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.710
<v Speaker 1>It would mean that before presenting </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own point of view,</v>

180
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:39.711
<v Speaker 1>it'd be necessary for you to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve the other speakers frame of </v>

181
00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:42.801
<v Speaker 1>reference to understand his thoughts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings so well that you could </v>

182
00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:44.220
<v Speaker 1>summarize them for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds simple,</v>

183
00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:46.620
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you'll try it,</v>

184
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:50.160
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that it's the most difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you've ever done.</v>

185
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

186
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.730
<v Speaker 1>We'll leave it at that and then we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>see you on Tuesday.</v>
