<v Speaker 1>What would be a practical approach for </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing your shadow?</v>

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one.</v>

3
00:00:04.551 --> 00:00:09.551
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do a little review of union </v>

4
00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:09.551
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is,</v>

5
00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:10.880
<v Speaker 1>if you want to know about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper sources.</v>

6
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Carl [inaudible] collected works volume </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

7
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 1>volume nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's two parts to volume 9:00</v>

8
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.510
<v Speaker 1>AM be published as separate texts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>volume nine is called archetypes of the </v>

9
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.391
<v Speaker 1>collective unconscious and the other one</v>
<v Speaker 1>is called a ion.</v>

10
00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:31.730
<v Speaker 1>But in archetypes of the collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

11
00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:36.731
<v Speaker 1>there's a good discussion of the persona</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the shadow and the persona you could</v>

12
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.490
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a good way of thinking about it?</v>

13
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:45.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch all those Rom coms where </v>

14
00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:48.311
<v Speaker 1>there's always kind of a Beta male guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's being real friendly and always </v>

15
00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:52.481
<v Speaker 1>failing miserably with women because </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically he's lying to himself and to </v>

16
00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:52.481
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 1>he's a persona and a persona is the face</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you show to the world when you're </v>

18
00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:03.911
<v Speaker 1>trying to pretend and to convince </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and others that you're,</v>

19
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.370
<v Speaker 1>I would say harmless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we could say a good person,</v>

20
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.570
<v Speaker 1>but a good person isn't harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good person is capable of,</v>

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a good person is capable of </v>

22
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>anything but is willing to hold that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>abeyance.</v>

23
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I read this interesting commentary a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little while ago on a statement by </v>

24
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.651
<v Speaker 1>Christ in the New Testament and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement generally interpreted is that </v>

25
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:34.971
<v Speaker 1>the meek shall inherit the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was looking up the multiple </v>

26
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:38.271
<v Speaker 1>translations of the word meek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meek is actually derived from a Greek </v>

27
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>word of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Bible,</v>

28
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>at least some of the original forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible were in Greek.</v>

29
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.540
<v Speaker 1>And that word didn't exactly mean meek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It meant something like,</v>

30
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

31
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.230
<v Speaker 1>those who have weapons and the ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use them,</v>

32
00:01:57.231 --> 00:02:02.231
<v Speaker 1>but cert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but determined to keep the machine will </v>

33
00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:05.561
<v Speaker 1>inherit the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that people who are </v>

34
00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:07.910
<v Speaker 1>capable of force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

35
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>but decide not to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in the proper moral position.</v>

36
00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:14.690
<v Speaker 1>And meet you commented on that a fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit too.</v>

37
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:15.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

38
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.570
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.010
<v Speaker 1>thought of most moral morality as </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardice,</v>

40
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>not because morality itself was </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardice,</v>

41
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:26.111
<v Speaker 1>but because most people who are cowards </v>
<v Speaker 1>disguise their coward,</v>

42
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.600
<v Speaker 1>cowardice as morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they claim that they're </v>

43
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.560
<v Speaker 1>harmlessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a consequence of their</v>

44
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:36.290
<v Speaker 1>fear and inability to be harmful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

45
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:41.291
<v Speaker 1>or to be dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually a sign of their moral </v>

46
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:42.950
<v Speaker 1>integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really bad idea.</v>

47
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.720
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.180
<v Speaker 1>if you're an ax murderer but you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an ax,</v>

49
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:51.110
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that your moral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now with regards to,</v>

50
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.730
<v Speaker 1>so that's the persona and the persona is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mask that you wear.</v>

51
00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's what persona means is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mask that you wear to convince and the </v>

52
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>world that you're not a terrible monster</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that when you look at yourself in the</v>

53
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to run away screaming.</v>

54
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you might think,</v>

55
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:11.071
<v Speaker 1>well that's a bit of an overstatement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you'll was very interested in </v>

56
00:03:11.071 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 1>phenomena such as say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological.</v>

57
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.090
<v Speaker 1>The psychological phenomena that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterize the actions of someone who </v>

58
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>might be an Auschwitz camp guard for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

59
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.450
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty monstrous form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

61
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:31.441
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about Auschwitz camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>guards is that there's no reason to </v>

62
00:03:31.441 --> 00:03:35.461
<v Speaker 1>assume really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were much different than </v>

63
00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:35.461
<v Speaker 1>normal people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

64
00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>there would have been exceptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

65
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.240
<v Speaker 1>but and what that means is that perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube could be an Auschwitz camp guard</v>

66
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:47.371
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps you would even derive some </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoyment out of it and you might think </v>

67
00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't think not so quickly.</v>

68
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.250
<v Speaker 1>And what that also implies is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see what that meant when you </v>

69
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>looked in the mirror and looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

70
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:59.011
<v Speaker 1>you might run away screaming because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have a revelation of just exactly </v>

71
00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>what the human being is capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very unpleasant revelation.</v>

72
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:06.631
<v Speaker 1>And also one of the things that stops </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from being enlightened because </v>

73
00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:10.770
<v Speaker 1>that revelation of the evil of the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>is part of the journey to enlightenment </v>

74
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>and an early part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the shadow would be all the parts of</v>

75
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>the personality that the persona </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejects.</v>

76
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.260
<v Speaker 1>And that might be the aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>element.</v>

77
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Certainly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the case with for people who are </v>

78
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>hyper agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you can tell,</v>

79
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two pathways to the development </v>

80
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 1>of the shadow and they're tightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>aligned with one another.</v>

81
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental pathway is truth,</v>

82
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 1>and that's to face the bitter truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>about yourself,</v>

83
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 1>but to break that down more </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly,</v>

84
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 1>you might think about that as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to observe your own resentment.</v>

85
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be resentful and bitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>in many situations because you don't get</v>

86
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>what you want and if you watch that </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment,</v>

87
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 1>bitterness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clc,</v>

88
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:55.621
<v Speaker 1>that it produces fantasies that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably dark and that can be very </v>

89
00:04:55.621 --> 00:05:00.331
<v Speaker 1>frightening and you might not want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>admit to yourself that you're actually </v>

90
00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:03.691
<v Speaker 1>capable of having fantasies like that or</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses like that or aggressive </v>

91
00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:08.550
<v Speaker 1>feelings like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is that if those </v>

92
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.420
<v Speaker 1>aggressive feelings and impulses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies are integrated into your </v>

93
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.961
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're opening up a dialogue </v>

94
00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:17.971
<v Speaker 1>with a part of yourself that can be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>forceful and strong and dangerous and </v>

95
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>it's really useful to be dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you can,</v>

96
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.700
<v Speaker 1>if you can be dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you often don't have to be.</v>

97
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's often weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

98
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weak men generally speaking,</v>

99
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:30.790
<v Speaker 1>who rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that that's a very,</v>

100
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>very common occurrence and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent act,</v>

101
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's born out of weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not out of strength,</v>

102
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

103
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.240
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you attend to your resentment honestly,</v>

104
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 1>and you observe yourself and what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually like.</v>

105
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.940
<v Speaker 1>You got to pay attention as if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know yourself as if you might harbor </v>

106
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.640
<v Speaker 1>hidden devils and then maybe they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge.</v>

107
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:53.641
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young also felt that sort of embedded </v>

108
00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 1>inside the shot where the contra sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>tendencies and so for example,</v>

109
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you see people who are well </v>
<v Speaker 1>men let's say,</v>

110
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.790
<v Speaker 1>and we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can also talk about women in this </v>

111
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.041
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men who have integrated their shadow </v>

112
00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>often also develop a kind of peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>grace that would be a consequence of not</v>

113
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>only allowing their aggressive side to </v>
<v Speaker 1>step forward,</v>

114
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 1>but also their feminine in Compassionate</v>
<v Speaker 1>side that might,</v>

115
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.710
<v Speaker 1>that they may have kept squelched </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of embarrassment about it or </v>

116
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>because they'd been harassed for being </v>
<v Speaker 1>weak or any number of things.</v>

117
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the practical approach for </v>

118
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.451
<v Speaker 1>developing your shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say is to contemplate and </v>

119
00:06:28.451 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 1>consider your resentment and notice what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says [inaudible] your resentment will</v>

120
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 1>also tell you what you have to say.</v>

121
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so look,</v>

122
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>look at what happened at Google this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>

123
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Damore wrote that memo and you can</v>

124
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:44.681
<v Speaker 1>imagine he was pretty angry and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>even somewhat resentful at having to </v>

125
00:06:44.681 --> 00:06:49.031
<v Speaker 1>attend that diversity seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm really just using this as an </v>

126
00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:51.791
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he did was decide that that </v>

127
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:54.290
<v Speaker 1>meant that he had something that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say and then look at the consequences</v>

128
00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

129
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:57.620
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolutely unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

130
00:06:57.621 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 1>if you're feeding oppressed at work or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're oppressed in your life or,</v>

131
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 1>or you know where you're oppressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

132
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 1>then you got to notice that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling oppressed.</v>

133
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to notice that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling resentful,</v>

134
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.320
<v Speaker 1>resentful and angry and bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even like Cain in the story of</v>

135
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel because cane is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the architectural bitter man.</v>

136
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.650
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to decide what it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you need to do in order to remove </v>

137
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.650
<v Speaker 1>from yourself that bitterness.</v>

138
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's usually means that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you have to say and then </v>

139
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to say it because you're soul </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on it.</v>

140
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.010
<v Speaker 1>And not only does your soul depending on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

141
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 1>I would say the fate of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on it because you know you might</v>

142
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 1>be wrong and then you should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightened out.</v>

143
00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're just being whiny and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to talk to somebody about that.</v>

144
00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 1>But it may be that you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>detecting something wrong.</v>

145
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Some tyranny that's directed towards you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other people.</v>

146
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:45.470
<v Speaker 1>And it's like your moral obligation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak up about it.</v>

147
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.770
<v Speaker 1>And so many workplaces become toxic to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use a terrible cliche because of the </v>

148
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 1>people in the won't speak up for what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually want,</v>

149
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 1>or they speak up too late and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all twisted up about it and,</v>

150
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 1>and you know they're torturing other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because they're so unhappy and so</v>

151
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:05.291
<v Speaker 1>forth and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So practical approach for developing </v>

152
00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 1>your shadow fundamentally is radical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honesty and young said that in a genuine</v>

153
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Speaker 1>moral effort was a good substitute for </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy.</v>
