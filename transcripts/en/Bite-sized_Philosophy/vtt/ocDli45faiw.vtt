1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:00.931 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>you hear very frequently people say </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like everyone's creative.</v>

3
00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:05.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just as wrong as saying that </v>

5
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>everyone's extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

6
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.781
<v Speaker 1>you have to be pretty damn smart to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative because otherwise you're just </v>

7
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.961
<v Speaker 1>going to get to where other people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>already got and that's not creative by </v>

8
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:17.961
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

9
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.450
<v Speaker 1>so being fast and being out there at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of things really makes a </v>

10
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.781
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you also have to have these </v>

11
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:26.781
<v Speaker 1>divergent thinking capabilities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of your traits.</v>

12
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Structure and creative people are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>different than non creative people,</v>

13
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because for example,</v>

14
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:37.371
<v Speaker 1>they're highly motivated to do creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and to experience novelty and to </v>

15
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>end to end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to chase down aesthetic experiences into</v>

16
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>a 10 movies and to read fiction and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to museums and to enjoy poetry and,</v>

17
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to enjoy music that's not </v>

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>conventional music for example.</v>

19
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>These aren't trivial differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so and so it's a real,</v>

20
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:56.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a real misstatement to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition that everyone's creative.</v>

21
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just simply not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of wishful thinking.</v>

22
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying that everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

23
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:07.191
<v Speaker 1>if everyone's intelligent than then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>term loses all of its meaning because </v>

25
00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>any term that you can apply to every </v>
<v Speaker 1>member of a category,</v>

26
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:12.460
<v Speaker 1>it has absolutely no meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't end.</v>

27
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.540
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing you want to be thinking </v>

28
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.540
<v Speaker 1>about here is that don't be thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that creativity is such a good thing.</v>

29
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high return strategy,</v>

30
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>so if you're creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just try this.</v>

31
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 1>There's creative people in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

32
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>you guys are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a hell of a time monetizing your </v>

33
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's virtually impossible.</v>

34
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really difficult because first of all,</v>

35
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:35.451
<v Speaker 1>let's say you make an original product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think the world will beat a pathway </v>

36
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:35.451
<v Speaker 1>to your door.</v>

37
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>If you build a better mouse trap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's complete rubbish.</v>

38
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't true in the least.</v>

39
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.140
<v Speaker 1>If you make a good creative product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've probably solved about five </v>

40
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.041
<v Speaker 1>percent of your problem because then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have marketing which is insanely </v>

41
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:53.301
<v Speaker 1>difficult and then you have sales and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have customer support and then </v>

42
00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you have to build an organization and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>

43
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>If it's really novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to tell people what the hell </v>

44
00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.750
<v Speaker 1>we built this future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

46
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 1>and it's available for people online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do you market that?</v>

47
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>No one knows what that is and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real problem.</v>

48
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:12.081
<v Speaker 1>If you read a book while then you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem that another million people </v>

49
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:15.381
<v Speaker 1>have also written a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you produce something that's </v>

50
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:15.381
<v Speaker 1>completely new and doesn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>

51
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>people can't search for it online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are they going to find it so you you</v>

52
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:23.661
<v Speaker 1>just have and then you have pricing </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and it's really unbelievably </v>

53
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>difficult to produce something creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then monetize it and even worse,</v>

54
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.330
<v Speaker 1>if you're the creative person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have a spectacular </v>

55
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.330
<v Speaker 1>invention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got no money,</v>

56
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

57
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>You've got no customers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

58
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>those are big problems and so maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go and you find a venture capitalist.</v>

59
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>We start with family and friends because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it works.</v>

60
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:44.331
<v Speaker 1>He raised money for your product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You raise money from your family and </v>

61
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:46.881
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's assuming you have family and </v>

62
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:47.760
<v Speaker 1>friends that have some money and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to give it to you and most</v>

63
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 1>people aren't in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a terrible barrier right off the</v>

64
00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:55.971
<v Speaker 1>bat and then of course you're putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family and friends at substantial </v>

65
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>financial risk because the probability </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're stupid idea is going to make</v>

66
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:02.871
<v Speaker 1>money is virtually zero even if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really brilliant idea and so then let's </v>

67
00:03:02.871 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you get past family and friends and</v>

68
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:09.301
<v Speaker 1>you get venture capitalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalists involved because that's </v>

69
00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:12.001
<v Speaker 1>often the next step or an angel investor</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's there's steps in building a </v>

70
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family and friends,</v>

71
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Angel investor that some rich guy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you happened to meet some manner in some</v>

72
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

73
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Who's who's into this sort of thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>is willing to provide you with some </v>

74
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>money to get your product off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground?</v>

75
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of your product is that person </v>

76
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.380
<v Speaker 1>going to take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

77
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>most of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of it,</v>

78
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.280
<v Speaker 1>and then if you get a venture and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder because you know you don't have </v>

79
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>any money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to bargain for control</v>

80
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>over your product?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll just say,</v>

81
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want the money or not,</v>

82
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>and if your answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he'll go and do something else with</v>

83
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:48.061
<v Speaker 1>his money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's no shortage of </v>

84
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>things that you can do with your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a million things you can do with</v>

85
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:54.421
<v Speaker 1>it so you're not in a great bargaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>position and then if you get venture </v>

86
00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>capitalists involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take another big chunk and maybe</v>

87
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>if they're not very straight with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just throw you out because maybe</v>

88
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>by that point in the company's </v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

89
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>you're nothing but a pain in the neck </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what do you know about marketing</v>

90
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.730
<v Speaker 1>and sales and customer service and </v>
<v Speaker 1>building an organization and running a </v>

91
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 1>business like you don't have a clue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why do they need you?</v>

92
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.140
<v Speaker 1>So even if you're a successful at </v>
<v Speaker 1>generating a new idea and you put it </v>

93
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.611
<v Speaker 1>into a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you as the </v>

94
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>originator of the idea are going to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>some money from it is very,</v>

95
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:27.211
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't be thinking that creativity is </v>

96
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:30.271
<v Speaker 1>such a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>is such a something you would want to </v>

97
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:30.271
<v Speaker 1>curse yourself with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

98
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:35.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not all bad because it opens up </v>

99
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.530
<v Speaker 1>avenues of experience for creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that aren't available to people </v>

100
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 1>who aren't creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it definitely is a high risk,</v>

101
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>high return strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>so the overwhelming probability is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you will fail,</v>

103
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 1>but a small proportion of creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>people succeed spectacularly.</v>

104
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like a lottery in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

105
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 1>You're probably gonna lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't lose,</v>

106
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 1>you could win big and that keeps a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of creative people going.</v>

107
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.100
<v Speaker 1>But also they don't really have much </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice in it because if you're a </v>

108
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 1>creative person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like to have a fruit tree that's,</v>

109
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 1>that's bearing fruit so you don't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

110
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 1>you can suppress it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very bad for,</v>

111
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:12.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creative people I've worked with as </v>

112
00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 1>if they're not creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're miserable so they have to do it.</v>

113
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

114
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.400
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's real joy and pleasure in it and,</v>

115
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

116
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

117
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 1>and psychological utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't necessarily mean that </v>

118
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.901
<v Speaker 1>it's an intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not a conservative </v>

119
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:27.901
<v Speaker 1>strategy for moving forward through </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

120
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

121
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:34.411
<v Speaker 1>whenever I talk to people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative and you guys should listen to </v>

122
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:34.411
<v Speaker 1>this because I know what I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

123
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:39.180
<v Speaker 1>if you happen to be creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a songwriter or another kind </v>

124
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.571
<v Speaker 1>of musician or an artist or or or any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other number of things that you </v>

125
00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:46.411
<v Speaker 1>might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a way to make money and then </v>

126
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>practice your craft on the side because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you will starve to death otherwise.</v>

127
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Now some for some of you that will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

128
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:57.031
<v Speaker 1>but it's a tiny minority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're best bet is to find a job that </v>

129
00:05:57.031 --> 00:06:00.151
<v Speaker 1>will keep body and soul together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>parse off some time that you can pursue </v>

130
00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 1>your creative thing because then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as a longterm strategy,</v>

131
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>medium to longterm strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a better one.</v>

132
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>But it's got incredibly difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

133
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

134
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:13.661
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly difficult for new </v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians to monetize their craft even </v>

135
00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>if they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good at it.</v>

136
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

137
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:17.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>

138
00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 1>so don't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I say,</v>

139
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's not.</v>

140
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's not creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody goes,</v>

141
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:22.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's terrible.</v>

142
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so terrible.</v>

143
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not self evident that you would </v>

144
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.960
<v Speaker 1>curse someone with high levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
