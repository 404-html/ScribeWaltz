1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.900
<v Speaker 1>This is the Peter Pan Story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking is Peter Pan is this </v>

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>magical boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pan means Pan is the god of everything,</v>

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not an accident that he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>the name Pan and he's the boy that won't</v>

5
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>grow up and he's magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Speaker 1>that's because children are magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can be anything there,</v>

7
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>nothing but potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Peter Pan doesn't want to give that </v>

8
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got some adults around them,</v>

10
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>but the main adult is captain hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>who the hell wants to grow up to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>Captain Hark?</v>

12
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a hook.</v>

13
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Second year a tyrant and third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're chased by the dragon of chaos </v>

14
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>with a clock in its stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>The crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already got a piece of you.</v>

16
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens when you get older.</v>

17
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Time has already got a piece of you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually it's going to taste for you </v>

18
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>and eventually it's going to eat you.</v>

19
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>And so the hook is so traumatized by </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that he can't help but be a tyrant.</v>

20
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 1>And then Peter Parent looks out </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatized Herc and says,</v>

21
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

22
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sacrificing my childhood for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

23
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except he ends up,</v>

24
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>can you lost Boyz in Neverland?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Neverland doesn't exist and who the hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be king of the lost boys.</v>

26
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.080
<v Speaker 1>And he also sacrifice is the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a hell of a real relationship with </v>

27
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.681
<v Speaker 1>a woman because that's Wendy Wright and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's kind of conservative middle class </v>

28
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.840
<v Speaker 1>London dwelling girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wants to grow up and have kids and </v>

29
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>have a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She accepts her mortality.</v>

30
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:32.151
<v Speaker 1>She accepts her maturity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Pan as to contend himself with </v>

31
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>tinkerbell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't even exist.</v>

32
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like the fairy of porn.</v>

33
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the substitute for the real thing.</v>

34
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the dichotomy that you're talking </v>

35
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.201
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very tricky because there's a </v>

36
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>sacrificial element in maturation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.630
<v Speaker 1>You have to sacrifice the pleura </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentiality of childhood for the </v>

38
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>actuality of a frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

39
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you do that?</v>

40
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:07.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one reason is it happens to you whether </v>

41
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:09.261
<v Speaker 1>you do it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can either choose your damn </v>

42
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:11.811
<v Speaker 1>limitation or you can let it take you </v>
<v Speaker 1>unaware when you're 30 or even worse </v>

43
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>when you're 40 and then that is not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy day.</v>

44
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.910
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see people like this and I think it's </v>

45
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>more and more common in our culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people can put off matt maturity</v>

46
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 1>without suffering and immediate penalty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all that happens is the penalty </v>

47
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>accrues and then when it finally hits it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wallops you because when you're 25 </v>

48
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>you can be an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no problem.</v>

49
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Even when you're out in a job search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

50
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 1>well you don't have any experience in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of clueless.</v>

51
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

52
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.770
<v Speaker 1>you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>it's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can.</v>

54
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what young people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're full of potential.</v>

55
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now you're the same person at 30.</v>

56
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like people aren't so thrilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>about you at that point.</v>

57
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell have you been doing for </v>

58
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Speaker 1>the last 10 years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

59
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm just as clueless as I was when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>22.</v>

60
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 1>But you're not 22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an old infant,</v>

62
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an ugly thing and all the </v>

63
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.400
<v Speaker 1>incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the the reason,</v>

64
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.460
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason you choose your damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice because the sacrifice is </v>

65
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least you get to choose it.</v>

66
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:18.421
<v Speaker 1>And then there's something that's even </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complex than that in some sense is </v>

67
00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:22.261
<v Speaker 1>that the problem with being a child is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that all you are is potential and it's </v>

68
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:27.361
<v Speaker 1>really low resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be anything but you're not </v>

69
00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:27.361
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

70
00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>So then you go and you do adopt an </v>
<v Speaker 1>apprenticeship,</v>

71
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.560
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you become at least you become </v>

72
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.650
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're something that makes the</v>

73
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>world opened up to you again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:42.691
<v Speaker 1>like if you're a really good plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you ended up being far more than a </v>

75
00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 1>plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

76
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>You end up being a good employer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

77
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:49.501
<v Speaker 1>not that plumbers are not putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>plumber stale and it's like more power </v>

78
00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>to plumbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've saved more lives than doctors.</v>

79
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>So hygiene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

80
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a really good plumber,</v>

81
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 1>well then you have some employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run a business,</v>

82
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>you make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you train some other people,</v>

83
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:04.981
<v Speaker 1>you enlarge their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of a pillar of the </v>

84
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:04.981
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your family,</v>

85
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:09.331
<v Speaker 1>it's you can once you pass through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow training period which narrows you</v>

86
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>and constricts you and develops you at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>

87
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:18.001
<v Speaker 1>then you can come out the other end with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of new possibility at help at </v>

88
00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:21.841
<v Speaker 1>hand and young talked about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thought that the proper part of the </v>

89
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:27.571
<v Speaker 1>proper path of development in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>half of life was to rediscover that </v>

90
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>child that you left behind as you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>apprenticing.</v>

91
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 1>And so then you get to be something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>regain that potential at the same time.</v>

92
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

93
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very,</v>

94
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's very wise,</v>

95
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.640
<v Speaker 1>very wise thing to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Yep.</v>

96
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>

97
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk more about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to pick your damn sacrifice.</v>

98
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.370
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to not make what your </v>

99
00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>sacrificial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you want to be or not.</v>

100
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.280
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing to know as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though it's rather rough thing </v>

101
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 1>to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other questions</v>

102
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.870
<v Speaker 2>I have no one else.</v>

103
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing you just said about noticing </v>

104
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.900
<v Speaker 1>and more and more and people live into </v>
<v Speaker 1>their 20 [inaudible] yeah.</v>

105
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.300
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about that or anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes from in terms of culture,</v>

106
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:27.780
<v Speaker 2>we live in,</v>

107
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.450
<v Speaker 1>think universities facilitate it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to university to not be </v>

108
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:38.931
<v Speaker 1>something instead of going to university</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be something and that's it's pleasure</v>

109
00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:39.450
<v Speaker 1>island</v>

110
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.800
<v Speaker 1>and the price you pay for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the U.</v>

111
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.070
<v Speaker 1>S is debt and you're enticed into it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the administrators can pick your</v>

112
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:53.071
<v Speaker 1>pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they they rob your future self while </v>

113
00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>allowing you to pretend that you have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

114
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

115
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>and you can't declare bankruptcy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your student loans.</v>

116
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:05.711
<v Speaker 1>In the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's indentured servitude and it is </v>

117
00:06:05.711 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>precisely pleasure island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly that.</v>

118
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.280
<v Speaker 1>And so tuition fees have shot way out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>control and part of the reason that </v>

119
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.541
<v Speaker 1>universities don't make more demands on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their students and let them get away </v>

120
00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>with all the things they let them get </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with is because they're basically,</v>

121
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.920
<v Speaker 1>why the hell would you chase them out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're $100,000</v>

122
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 1>or more so they can do whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want as long as you get to sell them to </v>

123
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.430
<v Speaker 1>the salt mines.</v>

124
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

125
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Did you know it's not the only reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the other thing that's happened </v>

126
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.041
<v Speaker 1>is that the rate of technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation is so fast now and the </v>

127
00:06:41.041 --> 00:06:44.341
<v Speaker 1>rate of turnover of things is that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is genuinely harder for people who </v>

128
00:06:44.341 --> 00:06:46.570
<v Speaker 1>are say 18 to 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

129
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.970
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of rough patch for,</v>

130
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.210
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for life was probably 14 to 17,</v>

131
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.980
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's,</v>

132
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 18 to 25,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

133
00:06:56.921 --> 00:07:01.921
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the jobs that the bloody hippies </v>

134
00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:05.140
<v Speaker 1>complained about being doomed to in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 sixties have now disappeared.</v>

135
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.070
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem was,</v>

136
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:11.130
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to work for a </v>

137
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.230
<v Speaker 1>corporation and get a salary for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of my life,</v>

138
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'll just end up with a pension</v>

139
00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:16.000
<v Speaker 1>and that'll be my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

140
00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:21.001
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a lot better deal than an </v>

141
00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:22.450
<v Speaker 1>endless round of part time starbucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>

142
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.700
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:27.520
<v Speaker 1>some of it is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

144
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.420
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

145
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a space now in our culture that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is lacking for people to make that </v>

146
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.960
<v Speaker 1>transformation from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from adolescence into adulthood.</v>

147
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 1>And so it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

148
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.210
<v Speaker 1>it's the cost of that is stalled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing.</v>

149
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:45.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing.</v>
