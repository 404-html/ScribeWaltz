1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.710
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that has just blown me</v>
<v Speaker 1>away in the last year,</v>

2
00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:06.860
<v Speaker 1>because I've talked to lots of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people live,</v>

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also lots of people online,</v>

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's more obvious live and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious in this theater as well,</v>

5
00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>is that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

6
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I've gone around and spoken and a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion of my audience has been young</v>

7
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.950
<v Speaker 1>under 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that and I've spoken to </v>

9
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.441
<v Speaker 1>them a lot about responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's so odd about about this is that </v>

10
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.800
<v Speaker 1>of all the things that I've spoken about</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I can see the audience and I can</v>

11
00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:38.801
<v Speaker 1>feel how the audience is reacting </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm always paying attention to </v>

12
00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 1>all of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in so far as I can manage that.</v>

13
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:43.940
<v Speaker 1>So I get some sense of how what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying is landing.</v>

14
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you have to do if you're going to </v>

15
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.651
<v Speaker 1>speak effectively to people and what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is if I talk about </v>

16
00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:54.581
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone b is silent just like they are </v>

17
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:56.000
<v Speaker 1>now silent and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not moving,</v>

18
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Focusing attentive,</v>

19
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 1>say pick up your responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pickup the heaviest thing you can and </v>

20
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.021
<v Speaker 1>carry it and the room goes quiet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's eyes open and I think that </v>

21
00:01:08.021 --> 00:01:11.930
<v Speaker 1>who making me break up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

22
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I was speaking to an </v>

23
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>English journalist today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just going to write an article in</v>

24
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Spectator magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about this and at the same</v>

25
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 1>point in the discussion the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the same emotional reaction.</v>

26
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't really understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

27
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about it that's so </v>

28
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.161
<v Speaker 1>crucial because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been fed this unending diet of </v>

29
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>rights and freedoms and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about that,</v>

30
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.670
<v Speaker 1>especially if there's something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that so pathologically wrong and </v>

31
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.811
<v Speaker 1>people are starving for the antidote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the antidote is truth and </v>

32
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:59.301
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't because that's what you should </v>

34
00:01:59.301 --> 00:01:59.301
<v Speaker 1>do in some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:03.970
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some I know better or someone knows </v>

36
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>better for you what you should do sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that.</v>

37
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 1>It's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that,</v>

38
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>it's that that's the secret to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful life and without a meaningful</v>

39
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all you have is suffering.</v>

40
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nihilism and despair and all of </v>

41
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and self contempt and that's not good,</v>

42
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:22.701
<v Speaker 1>and so the man hits necessary for men to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up and take responsibility and </v>

43
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
<v Speaker 1>they all know that and and are starving </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that message and the message is more</v>

44
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:34.791
<v Speaker 1>that that's also a good thing to stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and take responsibility because </v>

45
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>you're cursed so much now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

46
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

47
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.390
<v Speaker 1>from when you're young with this notion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your active engagement with the </v>

48
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>world is part of what is destroying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermining the planet and adding to the</v>

49
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:46.740
<v Speaker 1>tyranny of the social systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

50
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>how about not so much that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

51
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 1>because it's instant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

52
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 1>it's to soul deadening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's andy human right to the core and my</v>

53
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>sense instead is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:55.981 --> 00:03:00.981
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were able to reveal the best of </v>

55
00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:04.671
<v Speaker 1>yourself to you in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would be an overwhelming force </v>

56
00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:04.671
<v Speaker 1>for good.</v>
