00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peter says,</v>

2
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there we go.</v>

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to ask you about two different </v>

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.381
<v Speaker 1>psychological disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first being borderline personality </v>

5
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:11.770
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so two lectures ago,</v>

6
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.270
<v Speaker 1>somebody asks you about it and you gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>very sparse answer.</v>

7
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember exactly what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seemed like it was a of it,</v>

8
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.630
<v Speaker 1>there was too much complexity to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer it right there and then,</v>

9
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:30.631
<v Speaker 1>and then somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Cox asked you about the same </v>

10
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>disorder in your Patriot on live stream </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently and when they,</v>

11
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>when they asked you that you kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of stopped for a moment and </v>

12
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>something I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something kind of flicked on in your </v>

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.751
<v Speaker 1>head and it seemed like in you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought for a couple seconds and then </v>

14
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:45.910
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

15
00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that I can answer that </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now because it's just too,</v>

16
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.930
<v Speaker 1>it's just too bloody complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was wondering,</v>

17
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

18
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many young men have gravitated towards </v>

19
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.941
<v Speaker 1>your lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that there's something </v>

20
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:04.771
<v Speaker 1>about this particular disorder that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about people with this</v>

21
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:09.850
<v Speaker 1>particular disorder that might gravitate</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your insights and your lectures?</v>

22
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 2>So now I would say probably no to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second one,</v>

24
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 2>but I could comment more about </v>
<v Speaker 2>borderline personality disorder.</v>

25
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 2>I think I have enough mental energy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that tonight.</v>

26
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.280
<v Speaker 2>So technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's often considered the female variant</v>

27
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:29.780
<v Speaker 2>of antisocial personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

28
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:30.470
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

29
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 2>it's classified or it's classified in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the domain of externalizing disorders,</v>

30
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 2>acting out disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think what happens,</v>

31
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 2>we don't understand borderline </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality disorder very well mean.</v>

32
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 2>It's characterized by tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsivity,</v>

33
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.110
<v Speaker 2>radical confusion of identity and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>this pattern of idealization of,</v>

34
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 2>of people with whom the person afflicted</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a disorder is associated with </v>

35
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 2>radical idealization of those people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then radical devaluation of them.</v>

36
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 2>And then there's another theme that sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of weaves along with it,</v>

37
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:17.151
<v Speaker 2>which is the proclivity of people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>borderline personality disorder to </v>

38
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:22.581
<v Speaker 2>presumed that they will be abandoned and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then to act in a manner that makes such </v>

39
00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:28.011
<v Speaker 2>abandonment virtually certain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a very complicated disorder,</v>

40
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:34.731
<v Speaker 2>but that I think gets at the crux of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's interesting </v>

41
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:40.761
<v Speaker 2>about people with borderline personality</v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder and my experience is that </v>

42
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:44.511
<v Speaker 2>they're often quite intelligent and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see in the person with borderline </v>

43
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 2>personality disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

44
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.750
<v Speaker 2>the waste or the squandering of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous potential,</v>

45
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 2>they seem capable of thinking through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nature of their problems and </v>

46
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.901
<v Speaker 2>analyzing them and discussing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not capable whatsoever of </v>

47
00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 2>implementing any solutions.</v>

48
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.640
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

49
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.960
<v Speaker 2>technically there's no relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between Iq and conscientiousness.</v>

50
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.170
<v Speaker 2>It's very weird because if you read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychological literature and you </v>

51
00:03:25.341 --> 00:03:27.350
<v Speaker 2>read about the functions of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal Cortex,</v>

52
00:03:27.351 --> 00:03:32.351
<v Speaker 2>they're usually conceptualized in </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual terms and they're </v>

53
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:34.010
<v Speaker 2>associated with planning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategizing and so forth.</v>

54
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.180
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

55
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 2>that's what conscientiousness is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is planning and strategizing and </v>

56
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 2>implementation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the correlation between Iq and </v>

57
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.431
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so as the correlation between </v>

58
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 2>working memory and conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero and zero is a very low correlation.</v>

59
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really it's hard to find things </v>

60
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 2>in psychology that are correlated at </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>

61
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Things tend to be correlated to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>

62
00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:05.621
<v Speaker 2>They tend to be interrelated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The borderline seems to be able to </v>

63
00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:10.190
<v Speaker 2>strategize and to abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not to be able to implement</v>

64
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.030
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

65
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.370
<v Speaker 2>and so this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intellect per se seems to be </v>

66
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 2>functional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not embodied in action.</v>

67
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.090
<v Speaker 2>It's very so it can be frustrating to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with someone who has </v>

68
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.151
<v Speaker 2>borderline personality disorder because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can tell you what the problem is </v>

69
00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 2>and even tell you what the solution </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be,</v>

70
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 2>but there's no implementation.</v>

71
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

72
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 2>so maybe something went wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>developmentally.</v>

73
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 2>We don't know exactly how these sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things come about.</v>

74
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristic of borderline people with</v>

75
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:49.501
<v Speaker 2>borderline personality disorder is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they remind me very much of people who </v>

76
00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:54.061
<v Speaker 2>are two years old and in some manner </v>
<v Speaker 2>like people with borderline personality </v>

77
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 2>disorder can have temper tantrums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

78
00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:01.831
<v Speaker 2>they often do and you know now and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see a temper tantrum and they're </v>

79
00:05:01.831 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 2>usually thrown by two year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

80
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Most people grow out of temper tantrums </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time they were about three.</v>

81
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 2>They're very rare at four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a good thing because if they're</v>

82
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 2>still there at four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not a good diagnostic predictor.</v>

83
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.030
<v Speaker 2>That's a good diagnostic predictor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the kind that you want and </v>

84
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:23.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny the way that we respond to </v>

85
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:26.161
<v Speaker 2>two year old temper tantrums because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>two year old will throw themselves on </v>

86
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:29.461
<v Speaker 2>the ground and eat their hands and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>legs on the floor and scream and yell </v>

87
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 2>and turn red or even blue.</v>

88
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.250
<v Speaker 2>I saw a child once who was capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding his breath during a temper </v>

89
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.060
<v Speaker 2>tantrum until he turned blue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was really an impressive feat.</v>

90
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 2>You should try that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

91
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:43.261
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard because you really have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work at it and you see that in adult </v>

92
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 2>borderlines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll have temper tantrums.</v>

93
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:47.290
<v Speaker 2>And the funny thing is when a two year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old does it,</v>

94
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 2>it's a little off putting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when an adult does it,</v>

96
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.630
<v Speaker 2>it's completely bloody terrifying and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens very frequently with </v>

97
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 2>borderlines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would also say to some degree,</v>

98
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.860
<v Speaker 2>they didn't get properly socialized </v>
<v Speaker 2>between that critical period of </v>

99
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.711
<v Speaker 2>development between two and four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see the same thing with adult </v>

100
00:06:08.711 --> 00:06:12.251
<v Speaker 2>males who grow up to be antisocial </v>
<v Speaker 2>because a large proportion of adult </v>

101
00:06:12.251 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 2>males who grow up to be anti social are </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive as children,</v>

102
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 2>as two year olds.</v>

103
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a small proportion of two</v>
<v Speaker 2>year olds who are quite aggressive.</v>

104
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:24.011
<v Speaker 2>They'll kick and hit and bite and steal </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you put them with other two year </v>

105
00:06:24.011 --> 00:06:27.011
<v Speaker 2>olds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about five percent of the of the </v>

106
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:27.011
<v Speaker 2>males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller fraction of the females,</v>

107
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 2>but most of them are socialized by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time they're four,</v>

108
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 2>but there's a small percentage who </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't and they tend to stay anti social</v>

109
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 2>and they tend to turn into longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>offenders.</v>

110
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.810
<v Speaker 2>And and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the critical period for socialization </v>

111
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.871
<v Speaker 2>development seems to be between two and </v>
<v Speaker 2>four and it seems to be mediated by </v>

112
00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 2>pretend play in rough and tumble play in</v>
<v Speaker 2>those sorts of mechanisms.</v>

113
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 2>And if it isn't instantiated by the age </v>
<v Speaker 2>of four,</v>

114
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.370
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't happen and it doesn't look </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's addressable.</v>

115
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are dialectic behavioral therapies</v>

116
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.360
<v Speaker 2>that have been developed for people with</v>
