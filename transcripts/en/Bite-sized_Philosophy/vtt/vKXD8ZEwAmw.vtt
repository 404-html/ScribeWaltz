1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.980
<v Speaker 1>So the question was positive emotions </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediated by dopamine.</v>

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.590
<v Speaker 1>When you're advancing toward something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3
00:00:06.591 --> 00:00:09.050
<v Speaker 1>or when you have a cue that something </v>
<v Speaker 1>good is about to happen,</v>

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.700
<v Speaker 1>what is the system that mediates </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion at the satiation level?</v>

5
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Negative.</v>

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start with the satiation issue.</v>

9
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.930
<v Speaker 1>That seems most deregulated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin.</v>

10
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 1>The opiate issue is there are other </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of specific reward that don't seem</v>

11
00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:36.890
<v Speaker 1>to be merely motivated or merely </v>
<v Speaker 1>underpinned by dopamine,</v>

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.050
<v Speaker 1>and the opiate system would be one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

13
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.230
<v Speaker 1>There's an oxytocin system as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are other biochemical systems </v>

14
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:47.840
<v Speaker 1>that are involved in more specific forms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reward,</v>

15
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that's common among </v>
<v Speaker 1>instances that make it appear that </v>

16
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>you're moving forward is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dopaminergic element,</v>

17
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then one of the things that happens </v>

18
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>if you're higher in Serotonin because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more dominant,</v>

19
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 1>is that you're more satiated all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

20
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.620
<v Speaker 1>That's why people who are low in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy with decreased </v>

21
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.131
<v Speaker 1>levels of Serotonin are more impulsive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and also more emotionally dysregulated.</v>

22
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>They're more impulsive because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

23
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>you take your positive thing when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get it,</v>

24
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Speaker 1>and so they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more dissatisfied,</v>

25
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:28.630
<v Speaker 1>they're more looking for anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will produce a positive outcome,</v>

26
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>and then they're also more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience negative emotion,</v>

27
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.720
<v Speaker 1>partly because their serotonin systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>are lower,</v>

28
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.470
<v Speaker 1>indicating their tenuous status in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

29
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.150
<v Speaker 1>meaning that everything they do that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertain is far more dangerous.</v>

30
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 1>So this is also why it's very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>often when you're trying to treat </v>

31
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.651
<v Speaker 1>someone who's depressed because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could say there's not much difference </v>

32
00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:58.610
<v Speaker 1>between being depressed and existing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the biochemical state.</v>

33
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 1>That being at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy would produce.</v>

34
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>In fact they're the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then the question is,</v>

35
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:10.271
<v Speaker 1>are you depressed or are you just at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of a dominance hierarchy because </v>

36
00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:14.960
<v Speaker 1>those are not like the symptomatology is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

37
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:19.961
<v Speaker 1>very similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cause and the cure are not the </v>

38
00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:23.300
<v Speaker 1>same because you might be at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a dominant Turkey because you just.</v>

39
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Everything about your life is ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

40
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.590
<v Speaker 1>and of course your suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you depressed,</v>

41
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.090
<v Speaker 1>sir?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

42
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.090
<v Speaker 1>not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have nowhere to go.</v>
