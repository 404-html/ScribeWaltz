1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>The routes are pulling on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can measure rat motivation by how </v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.910
<v Speaker 1>hard they pull on this on the spring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.660
<v Speaker 1>and they're more motivated if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>running away and running towards.</v>

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.690
<v Speaker 1>But let's go back to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can take juvenile routes who </v>

5
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.871
<v Speaker 1>haven't been able to play for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they've been isolated or maybe </v>

6
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:21.261
<v Speaker 1>they just haven't been able to engage in</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical activity like many school </v>

7
00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:22.830
<v Speaker 1>children that you might be thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither allowed to play nor allowed to </v>

9
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.621
<v Speaker 1>engage in physical activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a reason I'm telling you </v>

10
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:30.621
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

11
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>you get one of these little rats and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can measure all hardy wants,</v>

12
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.220
<v Speaker 1>how hard it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll pull the go out and play or how </v>

13
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.220
<v Speaker 1>many buttons he'll push,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>and that gives you an indication of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>

15
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:43.341
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that the play deprived </v>

16
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>juvenile rat will fight harder to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a non play deprived.</v>

17
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 1>You've now rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can infer that the rat wants </v>

18
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>to go play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

19
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that,</v>

20
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>you do the same measurement with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone around you.</v>

21
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Speaker 1>If they want to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to poke and prod out them </v>

22
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.351
<v Speaker 1>to see what sort of things they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to overcome in order to go and </v>

23
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:07.161
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll object even if you don't really </v>

24
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:07.161
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a measurement device.</v>

25
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>And if they're willing to overcome a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of your objections,</v>

26
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

27
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:15.651
<v Speaker 1>well maybe they really want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing to really know </v>

28
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:19.430
<v Speaker 1>if there's something you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need about five arguments about why </v>

29
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.351
<v Speaker 1>you wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the probability that the person </v>

30
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:27.051
<v Speaker 1>who's opposing you will have five </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments about why you shouldn't have </v>

31
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:27.051
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very low.</v>

32
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>They just won't have thought it through </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

33
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.860
<v Speaker 1>So the other thing that happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future authoring exercises that you're </v>

34
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.131
<v Speaker 1>asked to articulate the reasons for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the goals that come out of your vision </v>

35
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>of the future.</v>

36
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>So you're asked like why would it be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you?</v>

37
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be good for your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be good for broader </v>

38
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.141
<v Speaker 1>society?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that gives you a three levels of </v>

39
00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>argumentation right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you have it articulated down into</v>

40
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>detail and it's related to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>important goals,</v>

41
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.870
<v Speaker 1>then you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a hell of a thing to argue with </v>

42
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.390
<v Speaker 1>because people just aren't that deep by </v>
<v Speaker 1>which I mean they just don't have that </v>

43
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:04.521
<v Speaker 1>many levels of explanation or objection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also really useful in </v>

44
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:08.571
<v Speaker 1>relationship to your own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you want to do something </v>

45
00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>that's difficult and that requires </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

46
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>a lot of different subsystems in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

47
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Speaker 1>you're going to throw up objections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

48
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that isn't what you should be </v>

49
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.521
<v Speaker 1>doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should be doing the dishes or </v>

50
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:19.521
<v Speaker 1>vacuuming or watching TV or looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

51
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>or if you're really sneaky when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do something hard,</v>

52
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:28.551
<v Speaker 1>what your brain does is give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else hard to do that's not </v>

53
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:31.371
<v Speaker 1>quite as hard so that you can feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>justified in not doing the thing you're </v>

54
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>supposed to because you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else useful.</v>

55
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 1>And if you give into that temptation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you often will,</v>

56
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.190
<v Speaker 1>then it winds and because it winds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets a little dopamine kick and it </v>

57
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>grows stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every.</v>

58
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Anything you let when the internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument grows and anything you let be </v>

59
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>defeated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shrinks because it's punished.</v>

60
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.600
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get to have its way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing really to </v>

61
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>remember is don't practice what you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>not want to become.</v>

62
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 1>And because those are their neurological</v>
<v Speaker 1>circuits,</v>

63
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>you build those things in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

64
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going anywhere.</v>

65
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>You can build another machine to inhibit</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

66
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the best you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they're in there,</v>

67
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>you can't get them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

68
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>And then the ones you build to inhibit </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be taken out by stress.</v>

69
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>And the old habits will come back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta be careful what you say and</v>

70
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>what you do because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build yourself that way.</v>
