1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.920
<v Speaker 1>There's this thing that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>this multi-headed snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's got this infinity problem.</v>

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that little circle down there,</v>

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>and the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cut off one head,</v>

6
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>seven more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>

7
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>That's the eternal problem of life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is they're there.</v>

8
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>There is the category of problems in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and it ain't going anywhere.</v>

9
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is can you deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole category at the same time?</v>

10
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how to be in the world is to deal</v>

11
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>with that category all at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how did,</v>

12
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>how did human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did they come up with as a </v>

13
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>solution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's so cool too,</v>

14
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>because the solution they come up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only was the heroism that allows you</v>

15
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:46.221
<v Speaker 1>to approach what you're terrified by and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you find offensive and to learn </v>

16
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:50.391
<v Speaker 1>from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the idea of sacrifice and that </v>

17
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>was played out by cultures everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including human sacrifice.</v>

18
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>And you think what the hell was up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those crazy bastard so long ago?</v>

19
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>They were sacrificing to the gods all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

20
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.020
<v Speaker 1>but kind of clueless behavior was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>burned something and please God burned </v>

21
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>something valuable and please God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

22
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 1>what was with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were they thinking?</v>

23
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't stupid.</v>

24
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they were stupid,</v>

25
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were not stupid and believe me,</v>

26
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:17.730
<v Speaker 1>they lived under a lot harsher </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions than we do.</v>

27
00:01:17.731 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>So those were some tough people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

28
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then you'd last about 15 minutes.</v>

29
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't want to be thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ancestors as stupid,</v>

30
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.390
<v Speaker 1>like there's no real evidence that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>much different cognitively than we were </v>

31
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.390
<v Speaker 1>150,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

32
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>

33
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sacrifice?</v>

34
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a discovery man.</v>

35
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:44.301
<v Speaker 1>It's the discovery of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the future is actually the </v>

36
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 1>place where there is threat and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>always going to be there.</v>

37
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make sacrifices in the present so </v>

38
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>that the future is better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

39
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Everyone does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing right now.</v>

40
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.100
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what your parents are doing when </v>

41
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.100
<v Speaker 1>they pay money to send you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

42
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>they think let you can bargain with </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

43
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can bargain with reality.</v>

44
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:11.391
<v Speaker 1>You can forestall gratification now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll pay off at a place in time that </v>

45
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:16.260
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even exist yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

46
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 1>who wouldn't believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a miracle that that </v>

47
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>occurs and it's not like people just </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured that out over night,</v>

48
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were champs for Christ's sake.</v>

49
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Like how are we going to come up with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea like that while it's like,</v>

50
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought about it for 7 million years </v>

51
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.350
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to the point where we could kind </v>

52
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>of act it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't know what we were doing,</v>

53
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>but it was a emerge just like a dream.</v>

54
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.480
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the terror of the future is a dream </v>

55
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>and his solution to the terror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dream of the terror of the future is</v>

56
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 1>another dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

57
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.780
<v Speaker 1>it comes out in mythology and in fantasy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in drama where you act out the </v>

58
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice and then it's a step on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to full understanding.</v>

59
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>So we can say sacrifice instead of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

60
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we still do it,</v>

61
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>it's just not concretized like it used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

62
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>We do abstractly and we all have faith </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it will work,</v>

63
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we also set up our society so that </v>

64
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>it'll work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one thing about,</v>

65
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of moral relativism for a </v>

66
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.690
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because I think it's an,</v>

67
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>it's an extreme form of cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

68
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>apart from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

69
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

70
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's minimal ways that you can set up</v>

71
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:31.230
<v Speaker 1>a society that will work and so one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them is,</v>

72
00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:36.231
<v Speaker 1>is that the society has to be set up so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your sacrifices will pay off or you</v>

73
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>won't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the society will die.</v>

74
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.250
<v Speaker 1>And so it has to make promises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have to make promises to one </v>

75
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.250
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what money is.</v>

76
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Money is a promise that your sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>will pay off in the future.</v>

77
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what money is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if the society is stable,</v>

78
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.360
<v Speaker 1>you can store up your work right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can sacrifice your impulses and you </v>

79
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:03.121
<v Speaker 1>can work and you can store up credit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future and then you can make the </v>

80
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:08.401
<v Speaker 1>future a better place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but society has to be stable enough to </v>

81
00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>allow for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hyperinflation will do you in.</v>

82
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>So the promise that's implicit in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency is the promise that what you're</v>

83
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 1>doing now will pay off in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if people don't have that promise,</v>

84
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 1>then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know what they do because in in gangs</v>

85
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say gangs in North America,</v>

86
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.610
<v Speaker 1>the time horizon of the gang members </v>
<v Speaker 1>shrinks rapidly because they don't </v>

87
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 1>really expect to be alive much past 21.</v>

88
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.770
<v Speaker 1>And so they get really impulsive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent and like,</v>

89
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 1>why the hell not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do when,</v>

90
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 1>when the future doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's not real,</v>

91
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.190
<v Speaker 1>you default back to living in the moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you take what you can get right now </v>

92
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder because you don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be around in a in a year</v>

93
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.220
<v Speaker 1>and you get whatever you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you can bloody well get it and </v>

94
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>that's like anarchy that state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't want to live in,</v>

95
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 1>some people like to live in that state </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're really wired for that,</v>

96
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're much more comfortable in </v>

97
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.580
<v Speaker 1>those conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

98
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.890
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of like warrior types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say in some sense.</v>

99
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:10.891
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most people that's just where that </v>

100
00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 1>stress will just do 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 1>the stress of a life like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
