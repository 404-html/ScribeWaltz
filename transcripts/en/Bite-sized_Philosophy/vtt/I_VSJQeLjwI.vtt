1
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say thank you so much,</v>

2
00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:06.730
<v Speaker 1>those an amazing talk and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering if you could elaborate.</v>

3
00:00:06.731 --> 00:00:11.731
<v Speaker 1>What I noticed a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go here to UBC is that a lot of </v>

4
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:13.060
<v Speaker 1>students and young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're often desensitized to,</v>

5
00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:18.061
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atrocities that communism or </v>

6
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:20.671
<v Speaker 1>ideologies that forged terrorism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's some sort of Stockholm </v>

7
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:23.710
<v Speaker 1>syndrome that I'm seeing where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are just,</v>

8
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.380
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like trapped and they can't.</v>

9
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.250
<v Speaker 1>They feel in a way they can't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about it and then they start to</v>

10
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

11
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.790
<v Speaker 1>like communism or they start to see more</v>
<v Speaker 1>social or adopt socialist policy that in</v>

12
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:41.791
<v Speaker 1>the end we'll get them killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get them hurt as long as you kind </v>

13
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.830
<v Speaker 1>of elaborate on what you think can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>done about that or even if something can</v>

14
00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:46.420
<v Speaker 1>be done in that respect.</v>

15
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think something can be done.</v>

16
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:53.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been trying to educate </v>
<v Speaker 2>people about the horrors of the Nazi </v>

17
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 2>regime in the Soviet regime in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular.</v>

18
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:00.220
<v Speaker 2>I've concentrated mostly on those two </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars,</v>

19
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:05.221
<v Speaker 2>but that's good enough and trying to let</v>
<v Speaker 2>people know that it was through the </v>

20
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 2>fault of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much like them,</v>

21
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:14.751
<v Speaker 2>that those systems are rows and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that there are steps you can take to</v>

22
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:21.681
<v Speaker 2>limit the probability that you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>participate in such a thing and that </v>

23
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:25.701
<v Speaker 2>those steps are associated with trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be truthful in your speech and </v>

24
00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:29.691
<v Speaker 2>actions because the stability of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems depends on the willingness of </v>

25
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:33.771
<v Speaker 2>individuals to lie and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also on your willingness to take </v>

26
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for the malevolence in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own heart.</v>

27
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 2>That manifests itself in those social </v>
<v Speaker 2>movements.</v>

28
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.120
<v Speaker 2>And so that when I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I do my lectures,</v>

29
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 2>when I do talks like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I put them on Youtube,</v>

30
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to do is exactly that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that was the best pathway </v>

31
00:01:55.951 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 2>forward through such things that I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>think up over 20 years of thinking about</v>

32
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:00.300
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

33
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

34
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:08.181
<v Speaker 2>one is so habituated to suffering that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can read the Gulag archipelago,</v>

35
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.950
<v Speaker 2>which is actually quite hard to read </v>
<v Speaker 2>without having an effect them like your </v>

36
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 2>psychopathic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that book doesn't affect you,</v>

37
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.820
<v Speaker 2>you know it should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you read it properly,</v>

38
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.060
<v Speaker 2>it affects you deeply and it's not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only example of that kind of literature.</v>

39
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.060
<v Speaker 2>So the people who are habituated aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've just been shown low resolution </v>

40
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 2>representations of things they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that looked vaguely bad.</v>

41
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.080
<v Speaker 2>You don't know a damn thing about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our education system has done a </v>

42
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.991
<v Speaker 2>tremendously appalling job of educating </v>
<v Speaker 2>young people about the absolute </v>

43
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe of radical leftism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not much better with regards to</v>

44
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.190
<v Speaker 2>say the actions of the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I would say on average people </v>

45
00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 2>are more aware of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>

46
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 2>But it's shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shallow knowledge.</v>

47
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.170
<v Speaker 2>So you make the knowledge deep and deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge changes people and wakes them </v>

48
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

49
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

50
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.650
<v Speaker 2>the only reason that I ever got </v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced that they're that good and </v>

51
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.621
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're real more real than anything else </v>

52
00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 2>wasn't because I learned that good was </v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

53
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 2>That's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hard.</v>

54
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.650
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to learn that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to find examples of </v>

55
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.650
<v Speaker 2>transcendent good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

56
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 2>they're rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>

57
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read history a bit and read it like it's</v>

58
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:38.101
<v Speaker 2>about you and there's no way that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do that without a transformation,</v>

59
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.940
<v Speaker 2>but people won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you want to imagine yourself </v>

60
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 2>as an Auschwitz guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a rough thing you see because you</v>

61
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 2>have to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See Young said,</v>

62
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 2>if you confronted the shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the dark side of people,</v>

63
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 2>the aggressive side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the malevolent side,</v>

64
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.860
<v Speaker 2>that it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really reaches all the way down to </v>

65
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.201
<v Speaker 2>hell and Dante sort of was trying to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward the same thing when he wrote the</v>

66
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 2>inferno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

67
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 2>With the levels of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

68
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 2>Because it was a voyage through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of evil,</v>

69
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:08.850
<v Speaker 2>right to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought the bottom was betrayal.</v>

70
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.730
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most.</v>

71
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.290
<v Speaker 2>The center of malevolence is betrayal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that because to be trained,</v>

72
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to get them to trust you,</v>

73
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 2>and trust is a moral virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

74
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Especially if it's courageous trust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it it.</v>

75
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.180
<v Speaker 2>It puts you in alignment with other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and allows you to move forward </v>

76
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.180
<v Speaker 2>into life and if you'd be trained that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you really,</v>

77
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 2>it's like a knife in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like knife in the heart,</v>

78
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 2>through the back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's someone who loves,</v>

79
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 2>loves you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>betrays you,</v>

80
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 2>and especially if they betray you for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your virtues.</v>

81
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.880
<v Speaker 2>That's a really nice twist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I believe because I think that people</v>

82
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 2>are capable of good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if they know enough about evil that</v>

83
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 2>that will straighten them out.</v>

84
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who wants that?</v>

85
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the things I really like </v>

86
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.900
<v Speaker 2>about young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's often regarded as a new age thinker</v>

87
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no new age thinker.</v>

88
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.380
<v Speaker 2>He knew that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pathway to enlightenment was barred </v>

89
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:12.571
<v Speaker 2>by the necessity of a passage through </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell and that no one was going to do </v>

90
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:17.701
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why there isn't a world full of </v>

91
00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:20.821
<v Speaker 2>enlightened people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say like it was just a matter </v>

92
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:22.030
<v Speaker 2>of doing nice things following your </v>
<v Speaker 2>bliss.</v>

93
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Let's say however you might put it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then why wouldn't everyone walk up the </v>

94
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 2>stairway to heaven?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That isn't how it works.</v>

95
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.230
<v Speaker 2>That's not how it works at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can be convinced of </v>

96
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 2>the necessity for moral action until you</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand exactly how dark and terrible</v>

97
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:44.641
<v Speaker 2>things can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's your fault that they're </v>

98
00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 2>getting that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who wants to think that?</v>

99
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 2>So you can think it though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not.</v>

100
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Not Without it burning you.</v>
