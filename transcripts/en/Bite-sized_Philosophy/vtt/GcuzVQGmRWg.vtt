1
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Stromboli is not happy with the tangled </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass,</v>

2
00:00:04.581 --> 00:00:09.581
<v Speaker 1>but then the crowd reacts very </v>
<v Speaker 1>positively and then that confuses the </v>

3
00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:09.581
<v Speaker 1>conscience because he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

4
00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>this is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's a tyrant like Pinocchio,</v>

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>making a fool of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything turns into a tangled mess,</v>

6
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.140
<v Speaker 1>but the crowd goes crazy and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inner fool,</v>

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>that can be entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to tell when the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially out of spectacle,</v>

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>because that's this crowd is at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacle.</v>

10
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.150
<v Speaker 1>You just don't know exactly why it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're responding positively,</v>

11
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:37.151
<v Speaker 1>but you definitely give them what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want and you can see this look on </v>

12
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:37.340
<v Speaker 1>strombolis face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this false.</v>

13
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this false kindness and generosity,</v>

14
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 1>public facing and oh well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

15
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:48.281
<v Speaker 1>the conscience is very confused and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really think this is an important thing </v>

16
00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:52.361
<v Speaker 1>because I've often thought I spent a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time thinking about Hitler and I was </v>

17
00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:52.361
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

18
00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>how do you get into a state like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

19
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.120
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

20
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.110
<v Speaker 1>he's a dictator and he led his people </v>
<v Speaker 1>down a bad path.</v>

21
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>

22
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:06.281
<v Speaker 1>That is not what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a conspiracy together and went </v>

23
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>down a bad path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now think about it this way.</v>

24
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.930
<v Speaker 1>If one person thinks something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

25
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>it's like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>But if five people tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then then to start to start not taking </v>

28
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.070
<v Speaker 1>that seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of narcissistic.</v>

29
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it isn't five,</v>

30
00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:30.451
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's 15 people tell you the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing or act the same way towards </v>

31
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like probably you should clue in,</v>

32
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>well what if you're a politician and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying out a bunch of different </v>

33
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.540
<v Speaker 1>ideas and you're good at interacting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the crowd,</v>

34
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.730
<v Speaker 1>you're charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch the crowd,</v>

35
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.520
<v Speaker 1>but you're not necessarily all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate.</v>

36
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.120
<v Speaker 1>You don't have your values all straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

37
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:52.121
<v Speaker 1>but you're kind of angry too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's because you spent a </v>

38
00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:53.530
<v Speaker 1>bunch of time in World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>world war one in the trenches,</v>

39
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>which was like no joke and all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends got blown up you and then you </v>

40
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.001
<v Speaker 1>were unemployed and then you tried to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>an artist and that didn't work out even </v>

41
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.941
<v Speaker 1>though you were moderately talented and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe the economy fell apart </v>

42
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:05.941
<v Speaker 1>completely on you.</v>

43
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Hyperinflation and then maybe there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a communist menace coming in from the </v>

44
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>east and they're genuinely was and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not the world's happiest clam at </v>

45
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.591
<v Speaker 1>that point and you're talking to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who aren't that happy either because </v>

46
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:23.671
<v Speaker 1>they were also badly defeated in world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war one and then they had a terrible </v>

47
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:23.671
<v Speaker 1>treaty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had decided they lost part of their</v>

48
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:28.591
<v Speaker 1>territory and so the crowd's not happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and neither are you and there's reason </v>

49
00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:30.910
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you start talking to them.</v>

50
00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:34.060
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what you're upset about </v>
<v Speaker 1>and neither does the crowd,</v>

51
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.230
<v Speaker 1>so you start to articulate some things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about why you might be upset and some of</v>

52
00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:43.231
<v Speaker 1>them fall flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're paying attention to the </v>

53
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:45.391
<v Speaker 1>crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you stopped saying those things and </v>

54
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:47.530
<v Speaker 1>some of the things make the crowd really</v>
<v Speaker 1>wake up and listen,</v>

55
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.930
<v Speaker 1>and so you start seeing more of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

56
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an.</v>

57
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.010
<v Speaker 1>It's an unconscious dialectic between </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and the crowd.</v>

58
00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:59.011
<v Speaker 1>It's mediated by consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like you're sitting there </v>

59
00:02:59.011 --> 00:02:59.011
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you might be,</v>

60
00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to this crowd more what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to hear.</v>

61
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.420
<v Speaker 1>It's more sophisticated than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you do that thousand times and </v>

62
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.831
<v Speaker 1>you do that to ever increasing crowds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the crowd really starts to go mad </v>

63
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>and they basically tell you that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>the savior of the nation.</v>

64
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like at what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many bloody people have to tell you </v>

65
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>that before you start to believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

66
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.080
<v Speaker 1>I would say with a typical person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100,</v>

67
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 1>we'll do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll get you going,</v>

68
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:32.311
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If 100 people tell you specifically why </v>

69
00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>you're special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be thinking.</v>

70
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're kind of humbled to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

71
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>

72
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be something to this man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a million people and they're</v>

73
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>roaring their approval.</v>

74
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when it's a whole nation,</v>

75
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 1>it's like good luck withstanding that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just not a chance.</v>

76
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.290
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to withstand that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could be like Gandhi and you </v>

77
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:58.261
<v Speaker 1>could have taken that into account </v>
<v Speaker 1>beforehand because he did he read </v>

78
00:03:58.261 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>tolstoy by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a student of tolstoy and that's.</v>

79
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.400
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting because tolstoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the person who developed the </v>

80
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.371
<v Speaker 1>techniques of nonviolence that gone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>USD and tolstoy was also a deeply </v>

81
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:12.670
<v Speaker 1>religious writer apart from his novels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are not,</v>

82
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say really in the religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>

83
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.600
<v Speaker 1>although they're profound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

84
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>tolstoy stressed humility with </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonviolence.</v>

85
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 1>He really stressed that and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi took to heart.</v>

86
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>So he lived a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

87
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.890
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very simple bare bones,</v>

88
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.950
<v Speaker 1>ascetic life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was to kind of see if he could </v>

89
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 1>keep his damn ego tamp down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:38.490
<v Speaker 1>the groundswell was building behind him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.500
<v Speaker 1>when he dressed really simply and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't own much and he ate very simply </v>

92
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 1>and he just tried to stay away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole materialistic success element that</v>

93
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:51.511
<v Speaker 1>would be an element of what would turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>them into an actor and also inflate his </v>

94
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:51.511
<v Speaker 1>ego.</v>

95
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seemed to do that pretty well.</v>

96
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he certainly.</v>

97
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he led a nonviolent revolution that </v>

98
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 1>resulted in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the independence of India.</v>

99
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.310
<v Speaker 1>It also produced a terrible civil war </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the separate separation of the </v>

100
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Muslim Indians from the Hindu Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

101
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you can precisely laid</v>
<v Speaker 1>out at the feet of Gandhi,</v>

102
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

103
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be an extraordinary person.</v>

104
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:20.131
<v Speaker 1>You have to be extraordinarily wise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take ridiculous precautions </v>

105
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:24.150
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to put yourself in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public sphere like that and expose </v>

106
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 1>yourself to that kind of adulation </v>
<v Speaker 1>without becoming a puppet of the crowd.</v>

107
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened to Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not like he wasn't also a </v>

108
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.341
<v Speaker 1>conscious manipulator and surrounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself by people who are propagandists </v>

109
00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a conscious element,</v>

110
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:41.431
<v Speaker 1>but you got to think these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and see how that dialectic </v>

111
00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:46.081
<v Speaker 1>develops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he learned how to appeal to the </v>

112
00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>darkest fantasies of the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really,</v>

113
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:50.170
<v Speaker 1>really good at it and that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialectic process,</v>

114
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:55.171
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crowd told them what they wanted to </v>

115
00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:55.171
<v Speaker 1>hear and it's the crowds a mob at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
