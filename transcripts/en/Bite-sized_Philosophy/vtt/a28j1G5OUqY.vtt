1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Pursue what is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not was this expedient,</v>

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.240
<v Speaker 1>you write in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no faith and no courage and no </v>

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.601
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice in doing what is expedient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you say to those of viewers that </v>

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:20.211
<v Speaker 1>don't pursue their dreams and are locked</v>
<v Speaker 1>into their careers because they are too </v>

6
00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>afraid to take risks and pursue </v>
<v Speaker 1>something meaningful?</v>

7
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I would say is,</v>

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be afraid of taking risks </v>

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>and pursuing something meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you should be more afraid of staying</v>

10
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's making you miserable,</v>

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like the first thing you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is dispense with the idea that you get </v>

12
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.891
<v Speaker 1>to have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any permanent security outside of your </v>

13
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>ability to contend and adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same issue with children.</v>

14
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're paying a price by </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there being miserable and you </v>

15
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

16
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>the devil I know is better than the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

17
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be so sure of that.</v>

18
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>The clock is ticking and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable in your job now and you change</v>

19
00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>nothing in five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be much more miserable and you'll</v>

20
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>be a lot older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is the luxury to pursue what is</v>

21
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our viewers have worked with this.</v>

22
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>They have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have payments in loans.</v>

23
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a luxury to pursue because we lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>the resources.</v>

24
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

25
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not talking about what makes you</v>

26
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:20.631
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a luxury to pursue what makes you </v>

27
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:23.691
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a moral obligation to pursue what </v>

28
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>you find meaningful and that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean it's easy.</v>

29
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>It might require sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you need to change your job to,</v>

30
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have a family and children</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a mortgage,</v>

31
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:37.371
<v Speaker 1>you have responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've already picked up those </v>

32
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:40.761
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just get to walk away Scott </v>

33
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:40.761
<v Speaker 1>Free and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

34
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:40.761
<v Speaker 1>I don't like my job.</v>

35
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no strategy.</v>

36
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>But what you might have to do is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

37
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this job is killing my soul or right?</v>

38
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>So what do I have to do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I have to look for another job while no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one wants to hire me.</v>

40
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

41
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>maybe you need to educate yourself more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need to update your,</v>

42
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>your curriculum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>veto,</v>

43
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:02.721
<v Speaker 1>your resume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need to overcome your fear of </v>

44
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:05.781
<v Speaker 1>being interviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need to sharpen your social </v>

45
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:09.321
<v Speaker 1>skills like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to think about these things </v>

46
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:09.321
<v Speaker 1>strategically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to switch careers,</v>

47
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it like an intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible person that might take you a</v>

48
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:14.230
<v Speaker 1>couple of years of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

49
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>of effort to do properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say pursue something </v>

50
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it important to have a vocation?</v>

51
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more important to to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ethos and ethic,</v>

52
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>so I have a program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

53
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:32.571
<v Speaker 1>called the future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a writing program that enables </v>

54
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:35.931
<v Speaker 1>people to develop a vision for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and then to develop a strategy and </v>

55
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>so it's based on the idea.</v>

56
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that and it's an extension of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas in the book or at least </v>

57
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.520
<v Speaker 1>something along the same lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that you want to do is </v>

58
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you were taking care of yourself</v>

59
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>like you were someone you cared for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is rule number two,</v>

60
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

61
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Then you should figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

62
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>if you could have what you needed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted,</v>

63
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>what would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of friends would you have?</v>

64
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>What would your family relationships </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like?</v>

65
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>How would you conduct yourself with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>children?</v>

66
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>How would you educate yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to think through how it is that</v>

67
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:12.151
<v Speaker 1>your life could be properly arranged if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had that ability and then you can </v>

68
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>name it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the funny thing is is that if you do</v>

69
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>positive goal of that sort and work </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards it,</v>

70
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.470
<v Speaker 1>you will move towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goal will change because you'll </v>

71
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.470
<v Speaker 1>learn things along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I've.</v>

72
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with hundreds of people in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical and consulting practice and we </v>

73
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.741
<v Speaker 1>set a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We develop a vision and work towards it </v>

74
00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:34.741
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

75
00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>things inevitably get better for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a luxury.</v>

76
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult.</v>

77
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a moral responsibility and it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

78
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

79
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:47.030
<v Speaker 1>The pursuit isn't for happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a moral responsibility to push you.</v>

80
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.550
<v Speaker 1>What is meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
