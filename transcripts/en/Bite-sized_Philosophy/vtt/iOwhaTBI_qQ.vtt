00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.820
<v Speaker 2>and why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Behold is the moat that isn't my </v>

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.921
<v Speaker 2>brother's eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but consider us not the beam that is in </v>

4
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:09.160
<v Speaker 2>or how will you say to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brother,</v>

5
00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:11.830
<v Speaker 2>let me pull out the motive of the NIH </v>
<v Speaker 2>and behold,</v>

6
00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 2>a beam is in nine Onei.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you might be wondering,</v>

7
00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 2>what a beam is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A moat is the dust speck</v>

8
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 2>and a beam is a very large piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lumber and so the issue is not so much </v>

9
00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:32.071
<v Speaker 2>the blindness of others even though </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's as much blindness among others </v>

10
00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:37.411
<v Speaker 2>as there is in as there is for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the issue here,</v>

11
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 2>the advice here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the description here is you should be </v>

12
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.771
<v Speaker 2>concerned about what's interfering with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own vision first and you should </v>

13
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:48.820
<v Speaker 2>leave other people the hell alone in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to that,</v>

14
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 2>and so if you're a mode of being in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is if you would just act better,</v>

15
00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:58.231
<v Speaker 2>things would improve for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if you identify the evil and the </v>

16
00:00:58.721 --> 00:01:02.980
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe is something that's outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone else needs to fix,</v>

17
00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:05.650
<v Speaker 2>or that someone's responded someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else's responsible for,</v>

18
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 2>then then you're not going to fix that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to remain blind to the </v>

19
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 2>things that you're doing and not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that make things not go well and so it's</v>

20
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 2>just better to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

21
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:29.771
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably blind in many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways and maybe there are some ways </v>

22
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:34.150
<v Speaker 2>that I could rectify that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>highly probable that you're blind and </v>

23
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.150
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

24
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in fact it's virtually certain and </v>

25
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 2>so it's just more useful to think,</v>

26
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 2>how is it that I'm wrong in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation?</v>

27
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you something that I learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do when I was arguing with my wife,</v>

28
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:52.101
<v Speaker 2>which happened quite frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you actually communicate </v>

29
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:57.111
<v Speaker 2>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find out that there's many things </v>

30
00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:59.061
<v Speaker 2>that you don't agree on and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you were actually different </v>

31
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:01.911
<v Speaker 2>creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're actually going to have </v>

32
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:04.641
<v Speaker 2>a truthful conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to find out that you </v>

33
00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:07.551
<v Speaker 2>don't see things the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you can either pretend that </v>

34
00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:11.301
<v Speaker 2>that's not the case in gloss over it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then ended up in a 30 year silent war or</v>

35
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:17.451
<v Speaker 2>you can or you can have the damn fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you need to have it and see if you </v>

36
00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:21.861
<v Speaker 2>can straighten it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now and then we'd get in a situation </v>

37
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:26.451
<v Speaker 2>where we were at loggerheads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't move and it would spiral up </v>

38
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 2>into hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

39
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 2>because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone laughs because they know they </v>

40
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 2>manifest plenty of hate speech towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>those they love.</v>

41
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things we learned to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>was when we hit an impasse was to </v>

42
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 2>separate and to go our own ways and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go sit and think,</v>

43
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:45.090
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

44
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 2>we're at this</v>

45
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.100
<v Speaker 2>unpleasant situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't figure out how to move forward.</v>

46
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 2>I'd always think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it's her fault.</v>

47
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's her fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Least Ninety five percent.</v>

48
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.620
<v Speaker 2>But maybe there was something I did that</v>
<v Speaker 2>contributed like five percent to it.</v>

49
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 2>And so I would sit and think and ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself a question,</v>

50
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there anything that I did in the last</v>

51
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 2>six months that increase the probability</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this impasse would manifest itself?</v>

52
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea how fast your mind will</v>

53
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:25.081
<v Speaker 2>generate an answer to a question like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because there's undoubtedly some </v>

54
00:03:25.081 --> 00:03:29.191
<v Speaker 2>idiotic thing that you did that you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you remember that increased the </v>

55
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:32.881
<v Speaker 2>probability that you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>your hands around the throat of the </v>

56
00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:35.911
<v Speaker 2>person that you love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you can go tell them that and </v>

57
00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 2>then you can have a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they do the same thing.</v>

58
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

59
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:43.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how I'm an idiot in this </v>

60
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there person says,</v>

61
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

62
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how I'm an idiot,</v>

63
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:51.151
<v Speaker 2>and then your two idiots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then maybe you can have a </v>

64
00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:53.041
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So thou hypocrite first cast out the </v>

65
00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:57.631
<v Speaker 2>beam of light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then shalt thou see clearly to cast </v>

66
00:03:57.631 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 2>out the mote of thy brother's eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pay hard to argue with that.</v>
