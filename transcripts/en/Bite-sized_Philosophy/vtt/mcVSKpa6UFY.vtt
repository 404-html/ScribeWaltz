1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.480
<v Speaker 1>What panksepp observed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a brilliant piece of </v>

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that first of all,</v>

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>juvenile male routes in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like too rough and tumble play,</v>

4
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>they like to wrestle and they actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>pin each other just like little kids do,</v>

5
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:18.981
<v Speaker 1>or like adult wrestlers do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pinned their shoulders down and </v>

6
00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:19.860
<v Speaker 1>that basically means you win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so okay,</v>

7
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>so that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's even cooler,</v>

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 1>I think while there's three things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is the rats will work for an </v>

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to get into an arena where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know that play might occur,</v>

10
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>and so that's one of the scientific ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>of testing in animals motivation,</v>

11
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you have a starving wrath and</v>

12
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>it knows that it's got food down the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a corridor.</v>

13
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 1>You can put a little spring on its tail </v>
<v Speaker 1>and measure how hard it pulls and that </v>

14
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.900
<v Speaker 1>gives you an indication of it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational force.</v>

15
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine the starving rat that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get some food and you have a </v>

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.250
<v Speaker 1>little spring on his tail and you walked</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some cat odor,</v>

17
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>so now that route is starving and wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out of there.</v>

18
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>He's going to try to pull even farther </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the food,</v>

19
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>so getting away plus getting forward are</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate motivational systems and if you</v>

20
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:08.271
<v Speaker 1>can add them together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real potent and part of the reason </v>

21
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>why in the future authoring exercise </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you guys are going to do as the </v>

22
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.711
<v Speaker 1>class progresses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're asked to outline the place you'd </v>

23
00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:15.711
<v Speaker 1>like to end up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your desired future,</v>

24
00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:20.631
<v Speaker 1>and also the place that you could end up</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you let everything fall apart is so </v>

25
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:25.431
<v Speaker 1>that your anxiety chases you and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach systems pull you forward.</v>

26
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>You're maximally motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>

27
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.840
<v Speaker 1>and it's important because otherwise you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be afraid of pursuing the things </v>

28
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>that you want to pursue.</v>

29
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's very common and so then the </v>

30
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>fear inhibits you as the promise pulls </v>
<v Speaker 1>you forward,</v>

31
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>but it makes you weak because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>

32
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>You want to get your fear behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing you,</v>

33
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.590
<v Speaker 1>and so what you want to be as afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more afraid of not pursuing your goals </v>

34
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>than you are of pursuing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

35
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:55.161
<v Speaker 1>very helpful and lots of times in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something really worth </v>

36
00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:55.730
<v Speaker 1>knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the advantages to </v>
<v Speaker 1>being an autonomous adult,</v>

38
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 1>is you don't get to pick the best thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to pick your poison,</v>

39
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.850
<v Speaker 1>you have two bad choices and you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick which one you're willing to suffer </v>

40
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>through and every choice has a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that element in it.</v>

41
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:14.511
<v Speaker 1>And so if you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really freeing because otherwise </v>

42
00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>you torture yourself by thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

43
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a good solution to this.</v>

44
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to the bad solution.</v>

45
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:19.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

46
00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there's just risky solution,</v>

47
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:26.751
<v Speaker 1>one and risky solution to and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>both of them are really bad,</v>

48
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.120
<v Speaker 1>but you at least get to pick which one </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to suffer through and </v>

49
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.391
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually makes quite a bit of </v>

50
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>difference because you're also facing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily that instead of chasing you,</v>

51
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>and that is an entire different entirely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different psychophysiological response.</v>

52
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Challenge versus threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same.</v>

53
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Even if the magnitude of the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

54
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>And so putting yourself in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging,</v>

55
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>let's call it mind frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just do that by magic.</v>

56
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Putting yourself in a challenging </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindframe is much,</v>

57
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>much easier on you psychophysiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't produce,</v>

58
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.110
<v Speaker 1>you don't go into the generalized stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>response to the same degree and you're </v>

59
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.861
<v Speaker 1>activating your exploratory and seeking </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems which are dopaminergic mediated </v>

60
00:03:07.861 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>and that involved positive emotion.</v>

61
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>So if you can face something voluntarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than having to chase you,</v>

62
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>it's way better for you cycle </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically.</v>

63
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

64
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:24.121
<v Speaker 1>it's worthwhile to go find the dragon in</v>
<v Speaker 1>its layer instead of waiting for it to </v>

65
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:24.990
<v Speaker 1>come and eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

66
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
<v Speaker 1>And especially when you also add the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that if you go find the dragon and </v>

67
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.661
<v Speaker 1>it's layer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might find it when it's a baby </v>

68
00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:36.091
<v Speaker 1>instead of a full fledged bloody monster</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is definitely going to take you </v>

69
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the reason why.</v>

70
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole bunch of things that,</v>

71
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that emerge out of that observation.</v>

72
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Like don't avoid small problems that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

73
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:51.001
<v Speaker 1>are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>face them because they'll grow into big </v>

74
00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>problems all by themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about,</v>

75
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>imagine the Tax Department sends you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>notification,</v>

76
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.220
<v Speaker 1>you owe them like $300.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>

77
00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's annoying.</v>

78
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't even want to open the </v>
<v Speaker 1>letter or maybe if you do,</v>

79
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>you just put it on the shelf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that damn thing doesn't just sit </v>

80
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>there like a piece of paper on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelf,</v>

81
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ignore that for five or six years.</v>

82
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.480
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be come attached to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of horrible things and if you </v>

83
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>ignore it long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the idea,</v>

84
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>it's going to turn into something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is completely unlike the little piece of</v>

85
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>paper that it's written on and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many,</v>

86
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.150
<v Speaker 1>many problems in life are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see they'll,</v>

87
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.540
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that they popped their ugly </v>
<v Speaker 1>little handout that you know and you </v>

88
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 1>might want to turn away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might want not want to think about it,</v>

89
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>which is the easiest way of turning </v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

90
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't attend to it.</v>

91
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you repress it or anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

92
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.610
<v Speaker 1>You just fail to attend to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really as a longterm </v>

93
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dismal.</v>

94
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
<v Speaker 1>It's also something that I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more characteristic of people who are </v>

95
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>high in neuroticism and high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness.</v>

96
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Agreeable people don't like conflict and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are high in neuroticism,</v>

97
00:04:55.601 --> 00:05:00.601
<v Speaker 1>we were highly negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emotion are hit harder per unit of </v>

98
00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty or threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you know,</v>

99
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:07.441
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly why in psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times the people you see need </v>

100
00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:10.891
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would be the opposite of </v>

101
00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:13.021
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they need to help get their anxiety </v>

102
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:13.040
<v Speaker 1>and emotional pain under control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

103
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Those are not the only reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's antisocial behavior,</v>

104
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>but you can't fix that in therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In all likelihood.</v>

105
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:20.560
<v Speaker 1>There's alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of lots of other reasons,</v>

106
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:22.030
<v Speaker 1>but those are two major reasons.</v>
