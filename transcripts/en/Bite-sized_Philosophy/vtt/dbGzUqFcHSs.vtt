00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Unknown unknown's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.920
<v Speaker 1>unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown unknowns,</v>

3
00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:08.921
<v Speaker 1>leap at you from places that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't expect because otherwise you </v>

4
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:13.241
<v Speaker 1>would have planned for the damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are the things that are always </v>

5
00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:14.600
<v Speaker 1>like poking their beak off at you when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you least expect it.</v>

6
00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:17.120
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say serpents in the garden of Eden.</v>

7
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.590
<v Speaker 1>That might be one way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

8
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:23.591
<v Speaker 1>You can't keep the damn snakes out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the garden and that's because you can't </v>

9
00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>make a bounded area and keep the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity out of it.</v>

10
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.790
<v Speaker 1>The complexity always sneaks back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try protecting your children from the </v>

11
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.180
<v Speaker 1>You can't make a bounded circumstance </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get rid of all the complexity.</v>

13
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>It always comes sneaking back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would be an unknown?</v>

14
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a good one.</v>

15
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an intimate relationship.</v>

16
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.320
<v Speaker 1>You've had it for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Trust your partner,</v>

17
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.200
<v Speaker 1>so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

18
00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:52.201
<v Speaker 1>where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know who you are and you have a </v>

19
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:53.500
<v Speaker 1>pretty good idea of who of where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

20
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>and then one day you'll find out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your partner has been cheating on you,</v>

21
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.690
<v Speaker 1>not with one person but with three </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and for the whole 10 years.</v>

22
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>

23
00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:08.911
<v Speaker 1>that comes as a shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you may have ignored many </v>

24
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:11.320
<v Speaker 1>intimations that such might be the case </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant.</v>

25
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it comes as a shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>what happens to you?</v>

27
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where you are.</v>

28
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where you've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

29
00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:26.221
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think you know where you've </v>

30
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:26.221
<v Speaker 1>been because you've already been there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of a sudden something can happen</v>

31
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:31.040
<v Speaker 1>so that you are so flipped over that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even know where you were.</v>

32
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.650
<v Speaker 1>So that means in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past is dependent on the present.</v>

33
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.470
<v Speaker 1>A very peculiar thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also have no idea where you're going</v>

34
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 1>in terms of not knowing where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Deep Bay because you might think,</v>

35
00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:51.361
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I thought it was in a marriage </v>

36
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:53.431
<v Speaker 1>that turns out to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I knew who my wife or husband </v>

37
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:56.821
<v Speaker 1>was that turns out to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I concluded on the basis that I knew my </v>

38
00:01:57.221 --> 00:02:02.221
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I knew something about women that </v>

39
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:04.891
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was in a relationship with </v>

40
00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 1>someone I could trust that is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about trust.</v>

41
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously too gullible and so what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that does is throw virtually everything </v>

42
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.710
<v Speaker 1>that's ever happened to me in severe </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt,</v>

43
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the emergence of chaos and that</v>

44
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.030
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're going from point a to </v>

45
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.671
<v Speaker 1>point b and something you don't expect </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself in the middle of your </v>

46
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:33.571
<v Speaker 1>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not such a catastrophe because </v>

47
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:35.791
<v Speaker 1>you can just work around it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes something pops up and like you</v>

48
00:02:35.861 --> 00:02:40.861
<v Speaker 1>just do not have a plan anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then you might ask yourself just </v>

49
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:43.060
<v Speaker 1>exactly where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You when you don't know where you are,</v>

50
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that's our place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a place that's well </v>

51
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.090
<v Speaker 1>documented in classic religious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological stories.</v>

52
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.250
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dallas,</v>

53
00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:59.251
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believe that the world is made out </v>

54
00:02:59.251 --> 00:02:59.251
<v Speaker 1>of chaos and order order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you,</v>

55
00:02:59.251 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>when you do gets you what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

56
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.880
<v Speaker 1>That's where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have no idea what's going on </v>

57
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.880
<v Speaker 1>and you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

58
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.900
<v Speaker 1>is there a way that you should act when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in chaos and the answer to that </v>

59
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.681
<v Speaker 1>is there better be because it's a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to visit several times </v>

60
00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>during your life and everyone visits </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

61
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's an archetypal story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the dissent to the underground.</v>

62
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Underground is that horrible place that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lurks underneath all of our </v>

63
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the frigid lake underneath the thin</v>

64
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:37.201
<v Speaker 1>ice that everybody's skating on and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that can manifest itself at </v>

65
00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:41.101
<v Speaker 1>any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why in the Dallas </v>

66
00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:41.101
<v Speaker 1>Assemble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Black Paisley is chaos by the way,</v>

67
00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 1>and the White Paisley is ordered in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>order Paisley.</v>

68
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a little black dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>that's because order can turn into chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>and does at any moment,</v>

70
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.910
<v Speaker 1>and the reverse is also true chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paternity to order at any moment and </v>

71
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>insight will do that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

72
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>alcoholics report that when they hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom,</v>

73
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:05.521
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's a patella system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look at the world in a different </v>

74
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:05.521
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

75
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>now they're a new person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're back from an underground.</v>

76
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>They've risen from the dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

77
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly because what it looks </v>

78
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.750
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your right hemisphere is pretty good at.</v>

79
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm inferring patterns in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

80
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.460
<v Speaker 1>in novel and chaotic places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of keeping track of things </v>

81
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.101
<v Speaker 1>that happened to you that are anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it makes alternative maps of the </v>

82
00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:29.911
<v Speaker 1>world that are there for you to rely on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree if that ever </v>

83
00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:29.911
<v Speaker 1>becomes necessary.</v>
