1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.320
<v Speaker 1>The idea of cultural appropriation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute nonsense.</v>

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>

3
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between cultural </v>

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.510
<v Speaker 1>appropriation and learning from one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.900
<v Speaker 1>It does the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

6
00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:21.901
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that there's no theft </v>

7
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:23.720
<v Speaker 1>between people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no,</v>

8
00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:27.430
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't mean that just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you encounter someone else's ideas,</v>

9
00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:30.580
<v Speaker 1>you have an immediate right to those </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas as if they were your own,</v>

10
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.650
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that manifesting in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own behavior,</v>

11
00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:40.651
<v Speaker 1>some element of another culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that that's somehow immoral is </v>

12
00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually one of the bases of peace.</v>

13
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that the various </v>

14
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.861
<v Speaker 1>groups of human beings that exist have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to offer each other is the tremendous </v>

15
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>value of their culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>it's been really interesting to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

17
00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>to watch the response of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ball of everyone,</v>

18
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.240
<v Speaker 1>but for this argument to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for young Caucasian males to hip hop,</v>

19
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an aggressiveness about hip hop </v>

20
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.031
<v Speaker 1>that's really attractive to young </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caucasian males and there's something </v>

21
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:09.031
<v Speaker 1>observed about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the,</v>

22
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>the spectacle of the young Caucasian </v>
<v Speaker 1>males taking on the persona of inner </v>

23
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:17.660
<v Speaker 1>city black gang members.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sympathetic to it because there </v>

25
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.481
<v Speaker 1>is an aggressiveness to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that art form that's a necessary </v>

26
00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:30.241
<v Speaker 1>corrective to the insistence that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest moral virtue for a modern man is</v>

27
00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:33.550
<v Speaker 1>harmlessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is observed.</v>

28
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Women don't even like harmless man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hate them.</v>

29
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flog them apart.</v>

30
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.300
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what</v>

31
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>are dangerous men who are civilized and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to help civilize them</v>

32
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>beauty and the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

33
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:57.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a funny story and only </v>

34
00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:57.141
<v Speaker 1>engineers could have come up with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they are the only ones that have</v>

35
00:01:57.141 --> 00:02:01.901
<v Speaker 1>the unparalleled blindness to social </v>
<v Speaker 1>convention that would allow them to </v>

36
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:04.430
<v Speaker 1>discover it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Google engineers,</v>

37
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>I like engineered by the way because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very straightforward.</v>

38
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>The Google engineers wrote a book awhile</v>
<v Speaker 1>back called a billion wicked thoughts,</v>

39
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:14.720
<v Speaker 1>which was a study of Internet searches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of them literally,</v>

40
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.240
<v Speaker 1>and they were looking a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pornography use.</v>

41
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:19.880
<v Speaker 1>And while there's lots of known about </v>
<v Speaker 1>male pornography use,</v>

42
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:24.881
<v Speaker 1>partly and it's easy to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean males are pretty visually </v>

43
00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>oriented in what attracts them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pornography is fairly straightforward.</v>

44
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 1>You can tell that if you look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>graffiti and a men's washroom,</v>

45
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:37.361
<v Speaker 1>you know it's like two circles in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>triangle and the men are absolutely </v>

46
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>transfixed.</v>

47
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>

48
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>The story is more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use pornography too,</v>

49
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>but it tends to be literary because </v>
<v Speaker 1>women tend to like words more.</v>

50
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.170
<v Speaker 1>They like visual stimuli and so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google guys tried to track down the </v>

51
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.040
<v Speaker 1>archetypal structure of how they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>use those words a female pornography </v>

52
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.031
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so some of you know how many of you </v>

53
00:03:12.031 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>know what a Harlequin romance is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

54
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are archetypal stories,</v>

55
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the taming of the wild man.</v>

56
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Essentially by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the desirable and virgin a woman.</v>

57
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 1>And if you think women don't want that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you better bloody well come up with</v>

58
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:27.420
<v Speaker 1>an explanation for 50 shades of grey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

59
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Which is the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most rapid selling novel in human </v>

60
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.221
<v Speaker 1>history and emerged at exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time that all of this noise about the </v>

61
00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>lack of the absence of gender roles is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being produced on Mohs.</v>

62
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like perfect female fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly archetypally correct.</v>

63
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:47.071
<v Speaker 1>It's beauty and the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the deal guys showed was the </v>

64
00:03:47.071 --> 00:03:51.421
<v Speaker 1>structure of beauty and the beast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they didn't use that as a </v>

65
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>reference that the female pornographic </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy was wild guy,</v>

66
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat careless about the wants and </v>

67
00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.090
<v Speaker 1>desires of others attractive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

68
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high status,</v>

69
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>tamed by the magic of a single woman and</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought into a relationship with her.</v>

70
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

71
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 1>but here's the comical part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This just made me laugh,</v>

72
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

73
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.530
<v Speaker 1>what were the five categories of most </v>
<v Speaker 1>desirable male entity used most broadly </v>

74
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 1>and female pornography?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

75
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>it's so embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women,</v>

76
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:22.351
<v Speaker 1>you have to cover your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will I say this because Vampire </v>

77
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Werewolf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaire surgeon and pirate.</v>
