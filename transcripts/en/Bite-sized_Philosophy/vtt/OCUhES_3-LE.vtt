00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>First contributors to poverty are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:05.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not so good to have a low Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.730
<v Speaker 1>people don't like the idea of Iq because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems so arbitrary,</v>

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a high Iq.</v>

5
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not like you deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>It's your setup that way pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>right from the beginning.</v>

7
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

8
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very stable.</v>

9
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.170
<v Speaker 1>You can make a high Iq person stupider </v>
<v Speaker 1>by not educating them up to the level of</v>

10
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:32.391
<v Speaker 1>their possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but taking someone who has a low Iq and </v>

11
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:35.571
<v Speaker 1>trying to raise that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you can figure out how to </v>

12
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:37.881
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know it's Nobel prize time for </v>

13
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>you because people have tried that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most recently with those,</v>

14
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:45.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luminol lumosity games and that sort of </v>

15
00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:48.081
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the evidence that those produce </v>

16
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>anything other than brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>performances on the lumosity game itself</v>

17
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.260
<v Speaker 1>is basically zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't been able to figure out how </v>

18
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.201
<v Speaker 1>to see because intelligence is across </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain phenomena and you can get really </v>

19
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:06.321
<v Speaker 1>good in a single domain by practicing </v>
<v Speaker 1>like mad and what you'd want is to </v>

20
00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:10.641
<v Speaker 1>practice like mad in a single domain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope that it generalizes to other </v>

21
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:14.331
<v Speaker 1>domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the holy grail of intelligence </v>

22
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:14.331
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

23
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's done it.</v>

24
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.930
<v Speaker 1>People claim it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the claims never hold up and people </v>

25
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 1>have been trying for a long time to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and they haven't been able to do it.</v>

26
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

27
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>differences in Iq really make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

28
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys,</v>

29
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 1>average Iq is probably one slash 25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One 30 ad at 1:15.</v>

30
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:44.751
<v Speaker 1>You're at the 85th percentile and 1:15</v>
<v Speaker 1>would barely get you going for you.</v>

31
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 1>For Harvard University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1:30,</v>

32
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>you're probably graduate school </v>
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>

33
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1:45.</v>

34
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>You're up there at the range where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can probably do pretty much whatever you</v>

35
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although as you get smarter,</v>

36
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>the scatter between your abilities </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>

37
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>So you might have a very high verbal Iq </v>
<v Speaker 1>but not be so good at mathematics or the</v>

38
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.740
<v Speaker 1>other way around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a massive contributor to </v>

39
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.741
<v Speaker 1>lifetime success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what to do about that.</v>

40
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean why do smart people make more </v>
<v Speaker 1>money?</v>

41
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Well they get to where the edge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>production is faster.</v>

42
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a thousand people and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>rank order them by ICU,</v>

43
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 1>the smart people are going to come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a new ideas first and they're gonna</v>

44
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>have more ideas and they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategize better.</v>

45
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an Iq of 90,</v>

46
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.960
<v Speaker 1>which is 15 percent of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about that 15 percent of the </v>

47
00:02:47.381 --> 00:02:52.381
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much the threshold for </v>

48
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:53.440
<v Speaker 1>reading instructions and being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow them.</v>

49
00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.510
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our society is increasingly </v>

50
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's by no means obvious.</v>

51
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Liberals Think,</v>

52
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:09.781
<v Speaker 1>well society is unfair because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment and the Conservatives think</v>

53
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 1>while there's a job for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none of them think,</v>

54
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are massive,</v>

55
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:20.401
<v Speaker 1>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive differences in people's ability </v>

56
00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:23.670
<v Speaker 1>far greater than anyone realizes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that poses a structural problem.</v>
