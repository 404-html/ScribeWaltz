1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.260
<v Speaker 1>In terms of my question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most of your belief that it's </v>

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.971
<v Speaker 1>extremely important and everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing to speak our mind to speak </v>

3
00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:10.020
<v Speaker 1>really that's why we're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of practicality,</v>

4
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:15.021
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things that get in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of our license students and we have </v>

5
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>our gala with a perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of practicality,</v>

7
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>what are kind of maybe your tips and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your perspective on the steps that </v>

8
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.601
<v Speaker 1>students can take to kind of speak their</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind while not sacrificing kind of </v>

9
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.030
<v Speaker 1>future prospects?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you a couple of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are very practical.</v>

11
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Don't break in your essays what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the professor wants to hear.</v>

12
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.840
<v Speaker 1>There's absolutely no excuse whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 1>for doing that.</v>

13
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

14
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>most professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even those who have descended into an </v>

15
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>estate of ideological possession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say most of them still have enough</v>

16
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>character to grade an essay that's well </v>
<v Speaker 1>written properly.</v>

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>So you're actually taking less of a risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you would think by stating what you</v>

18
00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:01.880
<v Speaker 1>have to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

19
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.610
<v Speaker 1>if you start practicing when you're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

20
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>when mistakes are rather low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pandering to the audience,</v>

21
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:12.410
<v Speaker 1>let's say and say what you think will </v>
<v Speaker 1>get you by,</v>

22
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.570
<v Speaker 1>you're going to train yourself to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

23
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.750
<v Speaker 1>and once that means is you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>train yourself in the false suffocation </v>

24
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Speaker 1>of your character and your character is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing you have to guide you </v>

25
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No people dream of riches and they dream</v>

26
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:29.801
<v Speaker 1>of luxury and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a thin defense against the </v>

27
00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:31.460
<v Speaker 1>harsh realities of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have your character,</v>

28
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>and so what you do when you go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>university is you learn to say what you </v>

29
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.971
<v Speaker 1>think is clearly as you can and to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>the slings and arrows that come along </v>

30
00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:39.971
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

31
00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Not In an arrogant manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

32
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you know?</v>

33
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got plenty to learn,</v>

34
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:46.160
<v Speaker 1>but you want to formulate your thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully.</v>

35
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.350
<v Speaker 1>You want to write what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:50.450
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're writing,</v>

37
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're laying out the arguments that </v>

38
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.461
<v Speaker 1>you're going to use to structure your </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence in the world throughout your </v>

39
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you start to twist and bend those</v>

40
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.840
<v Speaker 1>for expedient reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to warp your soul,</v>

41
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.620
<v Speaker 1>and I mean I could talk about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurophysiologically if you want to.</v>

42
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become what you practice.</v>

43
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>You automate what you practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you automate expedient speech for </v>

44
00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:22.411
<v Speaker 1>the sake of short term gain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's what you're going to </v>

45
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:22.411
<v Speaker 1>produce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to produce expedient speech</v>

46
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:23.380
<v Speaker 1>for short term gain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:02:23.381 --> 00:02:28.381
<v Speaker 1>God help you if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there is nothing that you will </v>

48
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:32.761
<v Speaker 1>possibly do in your entire life that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will serve you better than to get </v>

49
00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 1>control of your voice in university I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever see you do that by reading,</v>

50
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.940
<v Speaker 1>You read great people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do that by writing what you think.</v>

52
00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:47.941
<v Speaker 1>You stay true to yourself while you </v>
<v Speaker 1>write what you think and you take the </v>

53
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:48.370
<v Speaker 1>risks and you gain the benefits that go </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with that.</v>

54
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>You learn to stand up and speak and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen carefully and that makes you a </v>

55
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.231
<v Speaker 1>negotiator of unparalleled power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a negotiator of </v>

56
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:02.281
<v Speaker 1>unparalleled power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing the world that won't </v>

57
00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:05.041
<v Speaker 1>open itself up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what you're doing in </v>

58
00:03:05.041 --> 00:03:08.221
<v Speaker 1>university and if you find professors </v>
<v Speaker 1>who who reject that and there's fewer of</v>

59
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:14.011
<v Speaker 1>them than you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's your sacred obligation to </v>

60
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:19.111
<v Speaker 1>stand up for yourself against that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to happen to you </v>

61
00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:22.831
<v Speaker 1>throughout your whole life and you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well start practicing how to do it </v>

62
00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how it looks to me.</v>

63
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an old saying that I,</v>

64
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I right.</v>

65
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

66
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I write in order to know what I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll note how compelled speech </v>

67
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.520
<v Speaker 1>interferes in that process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

68
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.820
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that you have to write what </v>
<v Speaker 1>your professor wants is a form of </v>

69
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.130
<v Speaker 1>compelled speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

70
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental issue.</v>

71
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.440
<v Speaker 1>As a therapist say when I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help someone set their life straight,</v>

72
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I do my best not to compel their speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is quite clear.</v>

73
00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have your destiny with all</v>
<v Speaker 1>its attended,</v>

74
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.380
<v Speaker 1>triumphs and sufferings and it's on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders.</v>

75
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to tell you how to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to tell you how to think </v>

76
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.710
<v Speaker 1>because I do not know how you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

77
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.980
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure that out for yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to bear the </v>

78
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.491
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for that and you are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly arrogant fool if you dare to </v>

79
00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:31.230
<v Speaker 1>tell someone else how it is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should conduct themselves through life.</v>

80
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>

81
00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:34.890
<v Speaker 1>while obviously I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

82
00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you should tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least you shouldn't lie,</v>

83
00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:39.900
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a dictate of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

84
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.550
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

85
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.050
<v Speaker 1>of action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

86
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:45.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a dictative process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

87
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

88
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:50.961
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't interfere with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism that allows you to solve all </v>

89
00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:54.000
<v Speaker 1>the problems that you will face in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and you come to university maybe to</v>

90
00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:56.280
<v Speaker 1>prepare for a trip for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a profession,</v>

91
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.680
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to set yourself up economically,</v>

92
00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:01.560
<v Speaker 1>but to set yourself economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>economically,</v>

93
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:06.561
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what your profession is </v>

94
00:05:06.561 --> 00:05:08.781
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no one who is more powerful </v>

95
00:05:08.781 --> 00:05:10.290
<v Speaker 1>than someone who can communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what the field.</v>

96
00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:12.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if you're a plumber or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a politician.</v>

97
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.300
<v Speaker 1>If you can formulate your thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>

98
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.650
<v Speaker 1>If you can conduct yourself honorably in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your action and your speech,</v>

99
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.800
<v Speaker 1>if you're articulate and careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the world opens itself up to you.</v>

100
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:27.390
<v Speaker 1>You have an unlimited horizon of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility,</v>

101
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.130
<v Speaker 1>so thank you very much.</v>

102
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
