1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you've had repeated </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights with your wife about how domestic</v>

2
00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:09.260
<v Speaker 1>duties are going to be arranged among </v>
<v Speaker 1>around mealtime and you believe me.</v>

3
00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:12.560
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have those fights and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so.</v>

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.680
<v Speaker 1>What's happening is that mealtimes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant because there's a war for </v>

5
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.370
<v Speaker 1>power going on in the kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.730
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think one day while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna,</v>

7
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Note that and you're going to do an </v>

8
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>archaeological investigation and find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out just what the hell is going on.</v>

9
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>And so you start unpacking the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>mealtimes are not pleasant.</v>

10
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>And so what's in that little thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're unpacking that package?</v>

11
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 1>the entire power dynamic between men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women in the modern world is inside that</v>

13
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might find that part of the </v>

14
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.900
<v Speaker 1>reason that your wife is upset about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that mealtimes are arranged.</v>

15
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Because because her grand mother was </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat by her grandfather and that's </v>

16
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>playing a role in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It played a role in determining her </v>

17
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.891
<v Speaker 1>unconscious expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's pathologizing one of the day </v>

18
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>to day rituals in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to unpack that,</v>

19
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:15.830
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to unpack all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that into the.</v>

20
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>You take a little monster and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>decompose it and you find out it's a </v>

21
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.451
<v Speaker 1>hydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got 50 heads and then you have to work </v>

22
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>through every single one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

23
00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:28.300
<v Speaker 1>really difficult and so it's a container</v>
<v Speaker 1>that contains everything.</v>

24
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.400
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is if you unpack it </v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully,</v>

25
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.200
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you deal with it,</v>

26
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.650
<v Speaker 1>you negotiate a consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden you get,</v>

27
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.480
<v Speaker 1>you get paced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say around your meal times,</v>

28
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:42.481
<v Speaker 1>which is a major accomplishment man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to eat three times a </v>

29
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:43.630
<v Speaker 1>day and it's the center of the household</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>

30
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is is that often when </v>

31
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.550
<v Speaker 1>you're especially in the context of a of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an intimate relationship,</v>

32
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.320
<v Speaker 1>things will emerge that produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>discontinuity.</v>

33
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should your attitude towards that </v>

34
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.801
<v Speaker 1>discontinuity be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you can punish the person for </v>

35
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:03.160
<v Speaker 1>manifesting that discontinuity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the tyrannical aspect,</v>

36
00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:06.580
<v Speaker 1>or you can let it take the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart and that will happen.</v>

37
00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:11.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's often how relationships and is </v>

38
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:13.681
<v Speaker 1>that a discontinuity emerges and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into it and things go sideways so </v>

39
00:02:14.711 --> 00:02:19.711
<v Speaker 1>badly that the whole relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>descends into chaos and people bail out </v>

40
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:20.410
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

41
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's no wonder that people want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore it and it's also no wonder that </v>

42
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.800
<v Speaker 1>they want to tyrannized it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

43
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.110
<v Speaker 1>quit bothering me with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Speaker 1>possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably not.</v>

45
00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 1>And also if my attitude towards you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>quit bothering me with that,</v>

46
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.010
<v Speaker 1>your attitude towards me when I have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same sort of problem in reverse,</v>

47
00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:47.011
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're not going to get anywhere </v>

48
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:47.011
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
