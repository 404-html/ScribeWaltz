00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Serve traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serve the father a psychologically </v>

2
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:10.851
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>support the tradition because you live </v>

3
00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>on it there in the old Mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Enuma Elish,</v>

5
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:18.861
<v Speaker 1>which you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can read about if you're </v>

6
00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>interested in the original gods who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really badly behaved.</v>

7
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>They're like two year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

8
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:26.271
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot like two year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kill the primordial God absolute </v>

9
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>who's the Patriarchal God to kill them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to live on his corpse.</v>

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we all do,</v>

11
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we live on a corpse of our </v>

12
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.361
<v Speaker 1>ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say we live in the Corpus of </v>

13
00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:40.251
<v Speaker 1>our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dead and that's not a great place </v>

14
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:40.251
<v Speaker 1>to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to keep reinventing it.</v>

15
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:43.470
<v Speaker 1>So the damn thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stays active and awake.</v>

16
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.670
<v Speaker 1>You stay on the carbs for too long and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the devil of or the demon of chaos </v>

17
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>comes back.</v>

18
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian story.</v>

19
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:56.061
<v Speaker 1>It's like don't be thinking that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay on the core of your ancestors for </v>

20
00:00:56.061 --> 00:01:00.621
<v Speaker 1>too long without contributing to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>revivification of the system because the</v>

21
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>chaos that all of that holds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

22
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.150
<v Speaker 1>that all of that holds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Bay will definitely come and visit </v>

23
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>you and you'll see that in stories like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hobbit.</v>

24
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>You know hobbits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're nice,</v>

25
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>they like to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of fat,</v>

26
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>they're short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not very bright.</v>

27
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>You know there are hubris stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea what's out there in </v>

28
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>the broader world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're protected.</v>

29
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.861
<v Speaker 1>If you remember by the striders who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sons of great kings who looked like </v>

30
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>tramps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have nothing but contempt for them.</v>

31
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>They patrol the borders and keep the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody hobbits safe,</v>

32
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>but they're out there in the periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Hell is brewing and chaos is,</v>

33
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is generating,</v>

34
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.230
<v Speaker 1>informing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's an archetypal story and </v>

35
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>that's why people liked that story so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much because that's exactly right.</v>

36
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Like we're the hobbits and there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are protected from chaos by the </v>

37
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>spirits of our dead ancestors and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>too damn stupid to know it and we think,</v>

38
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 1>oh well we don't need them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that to me,</v>

39
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:57.651
<v Speaker 1>that's postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the bloody universities are </v>

40
00:01:57.651 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>doing with the humanities to absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>appalling and we will pay for it.</v>

41
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.670
<v Speaker 1>So unless we wake up and hopefully we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>wake up because that would be better </v>

42
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.601
<v Speaker 1>than paying for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though being awake is rather </v>

43
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:08.601
<v Speaker 1>painful.</v>
