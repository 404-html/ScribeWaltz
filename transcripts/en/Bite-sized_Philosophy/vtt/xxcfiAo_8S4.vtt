1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.530
<v Speaker 1>And human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our principal made in the image of that </v>

2
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.421
<v Speaker 1>logos and that's why we can speak things</v>
<v Speaker 1>into being and we do,</v>

3
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>and when you speak truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you speak paradise into being and </v>

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.570
<v Speaker 1>when you speak falsely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you speak.</v>

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Helen's being and that's the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that with every </v>

6
00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:27.580
<v Speaker 1>decision that you make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you decide for yourself and for everyone</v>

7
00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're going to tilt the world a</v>

8
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:32.740
<v Speaker 1>little bit more towards hell or a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit more towards heaven,</v>

9
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and that's the burden you bear for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence and the choices that you make </v>

10
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.820
<v Speaker 1>as you pass through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the fleeing from that.</v>

11
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>That's at the bottom of the nihilism of </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism and the escaped into the </v>

12
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian certainties of idol </v>
<v Speaker 1>worship.</v>

13
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>And none of this is fictional because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen the consequences.</v>

14
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan said quoting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the source,</v>

15
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>that there could be no poetry after </v>
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz,</v>

16
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>but that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the poetry has to be about </v>

17
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lesson for Marsh,</v>

18
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>which was never again and fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

19
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.930
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't</v>

20
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.940
<v Speaker 1>decide not to repeat something terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you understand it,</v>

21
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.700
<v Speaker 1>and the way to understand it is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>smallest things of each individual </v>

22
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.650
<v Speaker 1>culminate in a great sense of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so when you ask why terrible things </v>

23
00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>happened in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is quite simple.</v>

24
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>The answer is because you're not good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and it's because you don't tell </v>

25
00:01:59.111 --> 00:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>the truth</v>

26
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Speaker 2>and you know it.</v>

27
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan said something I thought was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>

28
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>It's something I've thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't talked to him about it at </v>

29
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

30
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.910
<v Speaker 1>What happens as you move towards the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth and the answer is everything comes</v>

31
00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:17.170
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>

32
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.270
<v Speaker 1>really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is everything comes together.</v>

33
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.790
<v Speaker 1>There's even a sexual element to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of course,</v>

34
00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:26.791
<v Speaker 1>the highest element of sexual ecstasy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come together and around someone </v>

35
00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:31.870
<v Speaker 1>who's telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything comes together and that's the</v>

36
00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:33.280
<v Speaker 1>potential guests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the world.</v>

37
00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:36.970
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you can partake in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the calls.</v>

38
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.910
<v Speaker 1>It's the call to the greatest adventure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is.</v>

39
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>You can bring forth something akin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise by speaking the truth and you </v>

40
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.090
<v Speaker 1>can start in your own life and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>start in,</v>

41
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.540
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the life of your own families,</v>

42
00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:54.541
<v Speaker 1>and these are people in principle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you love and so why would you do </v>

43
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.430
<v Speaker 1>anything to speak the truth to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect them from reality?</v>

44
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.940
<v Speaker 1>There's no protecting from reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reality just is you interact with it on </v>

45
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>your terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you do that?</v>

46
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.450
<v Speaker 1>My face get forthright and you do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>by not shying away from the challenge.</v>

47
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the sermon on the mount.</v>

48
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange document.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you what I think it </v>

49
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.910
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

50
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.550
<v Speaker 1>It means conceptualize the highest good </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you town and so you might think </v>

51
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>that would be the highest good for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would be the highest good for the</v>

52
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:41.311
<v Speaker 1>family around you that you love and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the highest good that sound </v>

53
00:03:41.311 --> 00:03:44.741
<v Speaker 1>like in the state and it would be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest good for the state in the world </v>

54
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>and that would be the highest possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

55
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Even though even though you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to that,</v>

56
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.800
<v Speaker 1>make that what you want and then tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth and it's an adventure because </v>

57
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:59.791
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea because if you treat </v>

58
00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>things instrumental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you treat people instrumental,</v>

59
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>you use them as tools for your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire and not.</v>

60
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is what do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about what you designed?</v>

61
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Many things that you chase will turn out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be empty.</v>

62
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you just tell the truth?</v>

63
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world will unfold around you in very</v>

64
00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:22.211
<v Speaker 1>strange and mysterious ways and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't anything that's more exciting to </v>

65
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:25.731
<v Speaker 1>now and it's perhaps something excited </v>
<v Speaker 1>me enough so that suffering that's </v>

66
00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:28.790
<v Speaker 1>attendant on being would redeem itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why that adventure,</v>

67
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>and that's the call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the western call to the </v>

68
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.631
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is suffering of being can redeem itself </v>

69
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>through truth and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

70
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a proposition that you need to </v>

71
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.820
<v Speaker 1>adhere to like a good citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

72
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 1>it's the proper way of winning your way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the terrible world without </v>

73
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.450
<v Speaker 1>making it worse than it already is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the possibility perhaps of making it</v>

74
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no more exciting possibility to </v>

75
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.721
<v Speaker 1>not a no higher moral demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is is everyone knows that you </v>

76
00:05:02.241 --> 00:05:07.160
<v Speaker 1>know when you lie according to your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>conception of the truth,</v>

77
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.240
<v Speaker 1>that there is some sheet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something shameful and demeaning about </v>

78
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.640
<v Speaker 1>that and know that it hurts people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

79
00:05:13.641 --> 00:05:16.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you do it despite all of that,</v>

80
00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:21.351
<v Speaker 1>in part because it's easy and partly the</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it because there's a crooked,</v>

81
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hellish part of your soul that's more </v>

82
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>than happy if part of what you do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>make everything worse.</v>

83
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.650
<v Speaker 1>The page for the sin of its existence.</v>
