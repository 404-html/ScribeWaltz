00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this cartoon,</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.470
<v Speaker 1>this is from a underground comic for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people who smoke way too much </v>

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.031
<v Speaker 1>marijuana and it's called a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are the fabulous furry </v>

4
00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>freak brothers and they were created by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gilbert Shelton who was one of the first</v>

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 1>underground cartoonists and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>least pathological ones with the best </v>

6
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>sense of humor and he writes these </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about these stupid hippies,</v>

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>three of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fabulous furry freak brothers.</v>

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>You see two of them there and all they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do is smoke pot and avoid responsibility</v>

9
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.240
<v Speaker 1>and and run away from the police and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's a nice satire and so and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have this cat and the fat one fat Freddy</v>

11
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>has the cat and they're too lazy to even</v>
<v Speaker 1>give her the cat in name.</v>

12
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.820
<v Speaker 1>So it's fat Freddy's cat and it has its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own adventure is mostly with like an </v>

13
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>army of cockroaches that that lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

14
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>They're like horrible slummy hell hole </v>
<v Speaker 1>of living place.</v>

15
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite comical.</v>

16
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hippies have stumbled across a small</v>

17
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>fortune and stoned out of their minds on</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine.</v>

18
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>They go out to set up utopia in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>countryside.</v>

19
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>They buy this terrible piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>

20
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>but they're so diluted that they think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a mansion and they bring their</v>

21
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>cat and I don't know if you've ever had </v>
<v Speaker 1>a cat,</v>

22
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:18.621
<v Speaker 1>but cats don't like to move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really bugs them and so they're not </v>

23
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 1>comfortable when you bring them to a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

24
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:24.921
<v Speaker 1>They're like the rat that's been taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of its comfortable cage and put it </v>

25
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:27.891
<v Speaker 1>into a new cage and the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put a cat in a new room and it </v>

26
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 1>depending on the cat obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally they'll retreat into a </v>

27
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.191
<v Speaker 1>corner and be and meow pityingly and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>very unhappy for quite a substantial </v>

28
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>amount of time.</v>

29
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>And so the cartoonist actually map this </v>
<v Speaker 1>out quite nicely.</v>

30
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>So the hippie takes the cat out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>box and says our new home,</v>

31
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out in the forest.</v>

32
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>This is the never been cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never been in the forest.</v>

33
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't know what the hell is up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the forest.</v>

34
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>And the cat's looking rather dubiously </v>
<v Speaker 1>and things.</v>

35
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:55.701
<v Speaker 1>So this is the country and then it's put</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the ground and it starts to slink as </v>

36
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slink,</v>

37
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>slink out into the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually what animals do.</v>

38
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a predatory evasion crouch.</v>

39
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 1>And so if they're put in a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>

40
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:09.231
<v Speaker 1>they'll hunker down and freeze first and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll slowly unfreeze and start </v>

41
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:15.351
<v Speaker 1>to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sniff first and then they'll start </v>

42
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>to move it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they do it like with trepidation and</v>

43
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:21.051
<v Speaker 1>slowly and tried to hide it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what the cat is doing and the </v>

44
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:24.051
<v Speaker 1>cat goes out into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far enough sniffing and all of a sudden </v>

45
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:24.051
<v Speaker 1>pow.</v>

46
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:29.030
<v Speaker 1>It goes underneath the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the toddler running back to </v>

47
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>the mother and the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another hippie there.</v>

48
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's fineas says,</v>

49
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:38.811
<v Speaker 1>where'd the cat disappeared to now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fat ready character says under </v>

50
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:42.981
<v Speaker 1>the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then accounts under there in the </v>

51
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:44.391
<v Speaker 1>dark with big eyes looking terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saying you'd hide too if you'd smelled </v>

52
00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:49.011
<v Speaker 1>what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what it smelled was this thing </v>

53
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:52.581
<v Speaker 1>that has like the head of a wolf and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a and antlers like a deer in the </v>

54
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>tail of a skunk and the feet of a like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken and horrible clause.</v>

55
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.560
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a monstrous amalgam of that which </v>
<v Speaker 1>lurks in the unknown.</v>

58
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.730
<v Speaker 1>And so the cartoonists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comedian got it perfect,</v>

59
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:11.491
<v Speaker 1>what is there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is out in the unknown while you </v>

61
00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>need one representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a thousand.</v>

62
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>And so you take pieces of what's out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that are relevant and you create a</v>

63
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>single image out of that and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

64
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>this is what's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

65
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:27.871
<v Speaker 1>well no such animal as that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually incorrect.</v>

66
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.590
<v Speaker 1>An animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much animals very much like that </v>

67
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a superordinate low resolution</v>

68
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It includes all those weird animals that</v>

69
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>might hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are out in the forest.</v>

70
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a useful category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird animals that might hurt you.</v>

71
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

72
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:52.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's differentiated things within </v>

73
00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:52.531
<v Speaker 1>that category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

74
00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every category has that nature.</v>

75
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Can still be further differentiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not protons,</v>

76
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could even be differentiated with </v>

77
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.551
<v Speaker 1>regards to location at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every category can be further </v>

78
00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>differentiated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is whether the category has</v>

79
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>some functional utility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least that's one of its questions.</v>

80
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's the thing to be afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
