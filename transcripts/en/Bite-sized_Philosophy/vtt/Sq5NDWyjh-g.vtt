00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're miserable and unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>here's a cure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find what's valuable and let it go.</v>

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>So we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:15.471
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a relationship that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's relationship with your </v>

5
00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:15.471
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

6
00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>and the relationship is pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're locked into it.</v>

7
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:22.701
<v Speaker 1>You value it and no wonder because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a relationship with your parents and </v>

8
00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>your suffering terribly because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you let it go.</v>

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a sacrifice and the idea is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

11
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>that'll clear the future for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>very frequently when people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering terribly,</v>

13
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>not always because sometimes you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer stupidly,</v>

14
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:41.781
<v Speaker 1>blindly and without recourse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you get cancer and then you </v>

15
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:45.621
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have no idea how to deal with </v>

16
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:48.171
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes the reason that you're </v>

17
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:50.091
<v Speaker 1>suffering is because you just won't let </v>
<v Speaker 1>go of the thing that's biting you and </v>

18
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:50.091
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I can't let go of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've had clients like this.</v>

20
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I can't stop communicating with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother who phones me three times a day </v>

21
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.020
<v Speaker 1>everyday of my life and never says </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that isn't unbelievably </v>

22
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>critical and demeaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't let that go.</v>

23
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

24
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>that's not such a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The funny thing too,</v>

25
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>often when people let something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that go,</v>

26
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.270
<v Speaker 1>it goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts itself out and then comes back so </v>

27
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.961
<v Speaker 1>they don't even end up losing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unless they're willing to let it go </v>

28
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>to sacrifice that they make no headway </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

29
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.200
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the rules is if people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>impeding your development,</v>

30
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>you sacrifice your relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

31
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

32
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>very rough rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
