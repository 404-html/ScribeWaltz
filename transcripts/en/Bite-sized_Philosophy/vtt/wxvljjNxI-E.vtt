1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Well then there's food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cole Cole,</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>who I have no respect for by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I think I've read a fair bit of full </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool and I think everything he says is </v>

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.680
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

5
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>he criticizes the idea of mental illness</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>as a social construct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.840
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not like psychiatrists and </v>

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.591
<v Speaker 1>psychologists and mental health </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals who are relatively well </v>

10
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:33.681
<v Speaker 1>informed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't known about that since for the </v>

11
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:36.171
<v Speaker 1>last 60 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might be a revelation to </v>

12
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:40.401
<v Speaker 1>people who who don't notice that psyche </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatry for example,</v>

13
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:46.011
<v Speaker 1>is something like a compromise between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the patient biology and the social </v>

14
00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

15
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Psychiatric ailments often have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological tilt,</v>

16
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:57.051
<v Speaker 1>but the way they manifest themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>society is clearly conditioned in very </v>

17
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>intense ways by the particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>

18
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Obtaining at the point that the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who has that biological predisposition </v>

19
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.181
<v Speaker 1>exists even whether or not that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological can be tilted one way or </v>

20
00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>another by the cultural norms.</v>

21
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with issues like </v>

22
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>insurance payment and treatment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitalization,</v>

23
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.230
<v Speaker 1>obviously you're pulling in all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that are by no means purely </v>

24
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.911
<v Speaker 1>scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't find it particularly useful </v>

25
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>critique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious as far as I'm concerned.</v>

26
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that the code did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think this is the typical,</v>

27
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>especially the French intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typical sleight of hand.</v>

28
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Once Marxism became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.170
<v Speaker 1>once you were no longer able to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself a committed Marxist because </v>

30
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>committed Marxism had led to </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable brutality,</v>

31
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a scale that had never,</v>

32
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>probably never been experienced in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire history of the planet,</v>

33
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>at least in terms of its reach and </v>
<v Speaker 1>duration.</v>

34
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get to call yourself a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxist anymore,</v>

35
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>although there were still people and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>still see them saying,</v>

36
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:12.891
<v Speaker 1>well that wasn't real Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I think is a cop out of staggering</v>

37
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>proportions.</v>

38
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>That usually means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

39
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 1>if I was the person running the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't have happened.</v>

40
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the logic behind it.</v>

41
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>They didn't put the principles into </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice properly.</v>

42
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

43
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:29.091
<v Speaker 1>well lots of people put the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles into practice and the same </v>

44
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:32.030
<v Speaker 1>thing happened everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at some point you have to kind of </v>

45
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>wonder if there's something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the principals.</v>

46
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Fico did was take the Marxist </v>

47
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.470
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that everything was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be boiled down to economics and </v>

48
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>economic power and translated it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that everything just boiled </v>

49
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.260
<v Speaker 1>down to power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.290
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that we have institutions</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to include and exclude and that the </v>

51
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>institutions always run for the benefit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those at the top.</v>

52
00:02:57.541 --> 00:02:58.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

53
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a little bit true,</v>

54
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:06.831
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a scientist would look at that and </v>

56
00:03:06.831 --> 00:03:06.831
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

57
00:03:06.831 --> 00:03:06.831
<v Speaker 1>well probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:03:06.831 --> 00:03:11.160
<v Speaker 1>power dynamics in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a functioning economic and political </v>

59
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.421
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe account for 10 percent of the </v>

60
00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:15.421
<v Speaker 1>variant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

61
00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:15.421
<v Speaker 1>maybe 15 percent.</v>

62
00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:19.770
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a say you want to go to an </v>

63
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>ivy league school while if your parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to the school,</v>

64
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:28.261
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to get in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not that much more likely to </v>

65
00:03:28.261 --> 00:03:28.261
<v Speaker 1>get in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you still have to be,</v>

66
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

67
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty decent,</v>

68
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high school gpa and you do very well on </v>

69
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.131
<v Speaker 1>the sats and you have some other talents</v>
<v Speaker 1>of some sort because that's also </v>

70
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:45.331
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they might pick you over someone </v>

71
00:03:45.331 --> 00:03:48.121
<v Speaker 1>else who's roughly will you qualified if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a familial history of </v>

72
00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:51.811
<v Speaker 1>attendance at school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously you get an exec and an </v>

73
00:03:51.811 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

74
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not the kind of advantage that </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts for the entirety of how the </v>

75
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>system is structured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an advantage.</v>

76
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 1>While you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not fair.</v>

77
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

78
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

79
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Most systems are certainly not 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent either.</v>

80
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:15.331
<v Speaker 1>Fair or just definitely not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

81
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:21.601
<v Speaker 1>instead of comparing them to utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might compare them to another </v>

82
00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:25.321
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the only reasonable way to do </v>

83
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:25.321
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything looks terrible when</v>

84
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>you compare it to the best thing you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly imagine,</v>

85
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.770
<v Speaker 1>but the best thing you can possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine is it's an empty fiction because</v>

86
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:37.771
<v Speaker 1>it's so devoid of detailed content that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't use it as a guide to reality.</v>

87
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea that things could be </v>

88
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.231
<v Speaker 1>better has its roots in in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a broad scale Utopian project and I </v>

89
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:52.681
<v Speaker 1>believe that things could be better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that when you're </v>

90
00:04:52.681 --> 00:04:56.281
<v Speaker 1>doing an analysis of a complex system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to compare it to an ideological </v>

91
00:04:56.281 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 1>utopia and then describe all the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's bad.</v>

92
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not appropriate to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too simplistic.</v>

93
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:09.751
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to do anything to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually address the problems that the </v>

94
00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:13.321
<v Speaker 1>system has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take that approach and then of </v>

95
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:17.791
<v Speaker 1>course like pure utopian thinking is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily dangerous because if you</v>

96
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:22.861
<v Speaker 1>think that your way of molding society </v>
<v Speaker 1>into some ultimate state of perfection </v>

97
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 1>is headed towards some ultimate state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfection,</v>

98
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.890
<v Speaker 1>then you can justify absolutely anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do right now on the basis of the </v>

99
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.760
<v Speaker 1>fact that things are going to improve so</v>
<v Speaker 1>radically.</v>

100
00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>In the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means any of your behaviors are</v>

101
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>excused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end is worth it.</v>

102
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone says that you have to kind of</v>

103
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:51.511
<v Speaker 1>wonder what they're actually planning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

104
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>what they're actually planning to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

105
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

106
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the issue?</v>

107
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue is that it's so the same </v>

108
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.450
<v Speaker 1>critic with regards to Food Co.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

109
00:06:06.451 --> 00:06:08.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically the same thing that food,</v>

110
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 1>coal criticized a variety of low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.750
<v Speaker 1>profound institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual institution say like marriage and</v>

112
00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:23.620
<v Speaker 1>then institutions of power like prisons </v>
<v Speaker 1>and institutions of um,</v>

113
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.950
<v Speaker 1>mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 1>the whole institutional framework.</v>

115
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.110
<v Speaker 1>He criticized them on the basis of power</v>
<v Speaker 1>and exclusion and you could do that and </v>

116
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>there's some truth in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

117
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:37.670
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coal also made the presupposition.</v>

118
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:42.671
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that presupposition is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everything is about something else </v>

119
00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:46.670
<v Speaker 1>is that it's almost impossible to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how it can be applied to fuko himself.</v>

120
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have to ask if you were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>student of flintco,</v>

121
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.030
<v Speaker 1>what power aims drove his attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze everything in terms of power.</v>

122
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.840
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think with google it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty obvious.</v>

123
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.470
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

124
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a game that never goes anywhere.</v>
