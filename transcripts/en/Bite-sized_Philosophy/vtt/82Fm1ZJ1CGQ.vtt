00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Speaker 1>When I talked to people about doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future authoring program,</v>

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.110
<v Speaker 1>they often put it off and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising because it's hard and and be,</v>

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>

4
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to write.</v>

5
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do a bad job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like assignments.</v>

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to do it perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to wait until I have enough time </v>

7
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>and like one of those is enough to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>you cold and all five of them you're </v>

8
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>just done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I tell people do it haphazardly,</v>

9
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>a tiny bit at a time and badly because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that.</v>

10
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 1>I tell my students when they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their thesis master's thesis,</v>

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>write a really bad first draft and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a little conversation about that</v>

12
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:45.411
<v Speaker 1>because they don't think I mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it sounds like a cliche in some </v>

13
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a cliche.</v>

14
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not a cliche at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means</v>

15
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.560
<v Speaker 1>you're a terrible writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

16
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>But if someone put a gun to your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

17
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to have your a hundred page </v>
<v Speaker 1>thesis done by next Monday,</v>

18
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>or I'll shoot you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't care how terrible it is,</v>

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>you would sit down and write it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is,</v>

20
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>then you have it right then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have something and then you can</v>

21
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:11.160
<v Speaker 1>fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can iterate and fix it.</v>

22
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>That bad first draft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most valuable thing.</v>

23
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:19.071
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a bad first draft of yourself </v>

24
00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>and there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an idea in the young developed </v>

25
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 1>about the trickster and the gesture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comedian,</v>

26
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:28.911
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the trickster is the precursor to </v>

27
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:31.431
<v Speaker 1>the savior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things I learned from </v>

28
00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:33.831
<v Speaker 1>young that was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so unlikely you'd never think that </v>

29
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>it's so amazing that that might be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>

30
00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

31
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

32
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the satirical in the erotic and the,</v>

33
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>and the troublemaker that the comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fool,</v>

34
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>the fool is the precursor to the savior.</v>

35
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're a fool when you start </v>

36
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.491
<v Speaker 1>something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you're not willing to be a </v>

37
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:52.491
<v Speaker 1>fool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll never start anything new,</v>

38
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>and if you never started anything new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you won't develop.</v>

39
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>And so the willingness to be a fool is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the precursor to transformation.</v>

40
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same as humility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're going to write your </v>

41
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>destiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do a bad first job.</v>

42
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get smarter as you move forward.</v>

43
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is that so something </v>
<v Speaker 1>beckons to you.</v>

44
00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:13.851
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the star that you pedal wished on </v>

45
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>was the wrong damn star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least it was a star,</v>

46
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least it was in the sky.</v>

47
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>At least it moved him forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you say in your life or something</v>

48
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>grips you and fills you with interest </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>

49
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I do that?</v>

50
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not that,</v>

51
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>then something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it's a mistake?</v>

52
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rest assured.</v>

53
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>What do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to stumble around,</v>

54
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's going to happen is this.</v>

55
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>You're going to move to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to not stay in spaces,</v>

56
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to wander around in </v>
<v Speaker 1>circles,</v>

57
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>and I see people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

58
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never knew what to do,</v>

59
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not so good,</v>

60
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>not so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>

61
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:56.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there is literature to that suggests</v>

62
00:02:56.481 --> 00:03:01.481
<v Speaker 1>that people are a lot more unhappy when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they look back in their lives about the </v>

63
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:07.081
<v Speaker 1>things they didn't do than they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the mistakes they made while they </v>

64
00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:10.981
<v Speaker 1>were doing things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's really worth thinking </v>

65
00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:13.561
<v Speaker 1>about too because there's redemptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes and a redemptive mistake would </v>

66
00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>be a mistake that you make when you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and try to do something.</v>

67
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>You know you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

68
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to do this.</v>

69
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>When you're not good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make a bunch of mistakes.</v>

70
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:21.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

71
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.570
<v Speaker 1>what's the consequence if you pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention is you're not quite so stupid </v>

72
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is you've been informed</v>

73
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>by your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the results of your errors,</v>

74
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>and so what happens is you follow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beacon,</v>

75
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>you follow the light and you're blind so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where the light is.</v>

76
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>It's dimly apprehended only and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to follow it,</v>

77
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.080
<v Speaker 1>but you decided to take some stumbling </v>
<v Speaker 1>steps towards it and as you take </v>

78
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.941
<v Speaker 1>stumbling steps towards it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become illuminated and enlightened </v>

79
00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>and informed because of the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your experience,</v>

80
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:57.781
<v Speaker 1>because you're pushing yourself beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are and you're going into the </v>

81
00:03:57.781 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>country that you have not yet been in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you learn something,</v>

82
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>and so what happens then is the star </v>
<v Speaker 1>moves.</v>

83
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>You move 10 feet towards it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

84
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>

85
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't there.</v>

86
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:08.970
<v Speaker 1>It's actually there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then you,</v>

87
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.210
<v Speaker 1>you see it somewhere else and you shift </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself slightly and you move forward </v>

88
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's what happens is that</v>

89
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you continue as you changed the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guides you forward,</v>

90
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.210
<v Speaker 1>moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

91
00:04:23.211 --> 00:04:25.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like God in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

92
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.780
<v Speaker 1>in the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Egypt,</v>

93
00:04:26.781 --> 00:04:28.340
<v Speaker 1>the pillar of light that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>following,</v>

94
00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:31.040
<v Speaker 1>it's moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a permanent thing.</v>

95
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.050
<v Speaker 1>You move towards it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it moves away,</v>

96
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:35.390
<v Speaker 1>it guides you forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you say,</v>

97
00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:39.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what I'm aiming at paradise itself,</v>

98
00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:41.510
<v Speaker 1>and the answer to that is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what do you know?</v>

99
00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:44.420
<v Speaker 1>You see you couldn't see paradise if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was right in front of you,</v>

100
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>but you might get a glimmer of it and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move towards it and you grow and </v>

101
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.551
<v Speaker 1>then the next time you open your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a little bit more clearly and </v>

102
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:56.150
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens is that just happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over,</v>

103
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It keeps moving</v>

104
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.850
<v Speaker 1>and so you move like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that's so cool is that all</v>

105
00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:08.010
<v Speaker 1>those zigs and zags you say on each of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those Zags,</v>

106
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.650
<v Speaker 1>zigs is a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit a wall,</v>

107
00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:13.020
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I had to die a little bit and I</v>

108
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.930
<v Speaker 1>barely got back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a phoenix transformation at each,</v>

109
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.540
<v Speaker 1>at each turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's painful,</v>

110
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.880
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is is that even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've.</v>

111
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 1>You've traveled 20 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say on that road and you've only </v>

112
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.120
<v Speaker 1>moved three miles forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've moved three miles forward instead</v>

113
00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:35.121
<v Speaker 1>of falling backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the thing too is that if </v>

114
00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:35.460
<v Speaker 1>you stand still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fall backwards.</v>

115
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.570
<v Speaker 1>You cannot stand still because the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>moves away from you.</v>

116
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:42.480
<v Speaker 1>If you stand still and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaces,</v>

117
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.840
<v Speaker 1>there's only backwards and so if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not moving backward,</v>

118
00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:47.160
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forwards,</v>

119
00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:52.161
<v Speaker 1>then you're moving backwards and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more more of the underlying truth of the</v>

120
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 1>matthew principle to those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything more will be given from those</v>

121
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 1>who have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything will be taken.</v>

122
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a warning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not stay in one place.</v>

123
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Well as you zig and zag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the maybe the cataclysm of each </v>

124
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>transformation starts to lessen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not so much of you that has to </v>

125
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>die with every mistake</v>

126
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.930
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you end up oriented at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably properly.</v>

127
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.990
<v Speaker 1>And if you were sensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have been your trip,</v>

128
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that and perhaps it's a lot worse </v>

129
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.691
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps there's no shortage of </v>

130
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:35.691
<v Speaker 1>backtracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

131
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Because as you stumble forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

132
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 1>you illuminated and inform yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps that's partly because the </v>

133
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.671
<v Speaker 1>world is made of information and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter it and tangle with it,</v>

134
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>then it informs you and then you become </v>
<v Speaker 1>informed and then your information and </v>

135
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.730
<v Speaker 1>then you're ready.</v>
