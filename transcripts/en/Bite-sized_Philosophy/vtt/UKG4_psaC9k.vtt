1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.970
<v Speaker 1>So people often ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you believe in God,</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.310
<v Speaker 1>which I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that question.</v>

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an attempt to to.</v>

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.920
<v Speaker 1>It's an attempt to box me in in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that it's an attempt to </v>

5
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:20.931
<v Speaker 1>box me in is because the question is </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked so that I can be firmly placed on </v>

6
00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>one side of a two of a binary argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I don't like to answer it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because a,</v>

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to be boxed in and B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know what the person </v>

9
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.941
<v Speaker 1>means by believe or God and they think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know and the probability that they </v>

10
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>construe belief and construed God the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way I do is virtually zero.</v>

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a question that doesn't work for me</v>

12
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:50.610
<v Speaker 1>on multiple levels of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but strangely enough,</v>

13
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:55.611
<v Speaker 1>just as we were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I the answer to that question popped </v>

14
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:55.611
<v Speaker 1>into my head.</v>

15
00:00:55.611 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I act as if God exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can decide for yourself whether </v>

16
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>that means that I believe in him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

17
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>but I act as if he exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good enough answer for that.</v>

18
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Then with regards to these other issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the divinity of Christ,</v>

19
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:18.471
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the same problems with the </v>

20
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:21.501
<v Speaker 1>question formulation obtain what do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean by divine and also what do you mean</v>

21
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>by Christ?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are very,</v>

22
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>very difficult questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

23
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>I believe that for all intents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>

24
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the logos is divine in so</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as we.</v>

25
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>If if by divine you mean of ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>value of ultimate transcendent value.</v>

26
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's divine.</v>

27
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>It's associated with death and rebirth </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly because the logo's dismantles </v>

28
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.151
<v Speaker 1>you and rebuilds you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what happens when you make an </v>

29
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:50.151
<v Speaker 1>error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you make an error,</v>

30
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:51.720
<v Speaker 1>some part of you has to go.</v>

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>That's the sacrifice you have to let it </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

32
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's a big part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

33
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>it's sometimes it can be such a big part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you that you actually die,</v>

34
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of dying and being reborn,</v>

35
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.060
<v Speaker 1>is there something more than merely </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical about the idea of being of </v>

36
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>dying and being reborn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

37
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:13.491
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because those are associated with </v>

38
00:02:13.491 --> 00:02:13.491
<v Speaker 1>physiological transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

39
00:02:13.491 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>What's the ultimate extent of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

40
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is what happens to the </v>

41
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.001
<v Speaker 1>world around you as you embark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you increasingly embody the logos and</v>

42
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the ultimate level of</v>

43
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the hypothesis is,</v>

44
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's a hypothesis that extends to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree to Buddha as well.</v>

45
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.200
<v Speaker 1>The hypothesis is that there has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>one or two individuals who managed that </v>

46
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>and that in their management of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they transcended death itself.</v>

47
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Well then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by transcended death?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

49
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>in the case of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's assume he was a historical figure </v>

50
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the time being,</v>

51
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.290
<v Speaker 1>which I think is the simplest thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume.</v>

52
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Uhm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there is sufficient evidence to </v>

53
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>conclude that you could conclude </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,</v>

54
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.851
<v Speaker 1>but I personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel that there's sufficient evidence </v>

55
00:03:08.851 --> 00:03:08.851
<v Speaker 1>to conclude that.</v>

56
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Did He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is his resurrection real but his spirit </v>

57
00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:20.580
<v Speaker 1>lives on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's certainly the case.</v>

58
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.190
<v Speaker 1>In what sense do you mean spirit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to qualify that,</v>

59
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>how well let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's imagine that a spirit is a pattern</v>

60
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>of being and we know that patterns can </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

61
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Independent patterns can be transmitted </v>
<v Speaker 1>across multiple substrates,</v>

62
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vinyl,</v>

63
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>electronic impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>air vibrations in your ear,</v>

64
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>neurological patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dance,</v>

65
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>so all the translation of what you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe as a spirit,</v>

66
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

67
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>it's that pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's independent of its material,</v>

68
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 1>substrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Christ spirit lives on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

70
00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>it's had a massive effect across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>is that an answer to the question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did his body resurrect?</v>

73
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

74
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The accounts aren't clear for one thing.</v>

75
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>What the accounts mean isn't clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened to a person </v>

76
00:04:24.721 --> 00:04:27.990
<v Speaker 1>if they bring themselves completely into</v>
<v Speaker 1>alignment.</v>

77
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.870
<v Speaker 1>I've had intimations of what that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

78
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.010
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand the world very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand how the world could </v>

79
00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:40.890
<v Speaker 1>be mastered if it was mastered </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

80
00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:43.680
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how an individual might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to manage that.</v>

81
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.680
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what transformations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might make possible.</v>
