1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got these two evil creatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>here at Fox and the cat.</v>

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I think this one's based on one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marx brothers,</v>

3
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>actually Harpo Marx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I believe,</v>

4
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>never said anything but be that as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>may,</v>

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.670
<v Speaker 1>there are these Ne'er do well characters</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Fox in particular.</v>

6
00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Now Fox is a standard trickster animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

8
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

9
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a classic animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because it's,</v>

10
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>it's good at hiding and it's good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

11
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an coyotes are like that too.</v>

12
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>They're classic trickster animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>he's Kinda like Wiley Coyote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

14
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:37.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

15
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>the warner brothers character who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>genius at large and of course whose </v>

16
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 1>arrogance continually gets him walloped </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this character has a lot of features</v>

17
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

18
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he feigns being,</v>

19
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:54.951
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an English gentleman of like the 18 </v>

20
00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:54.951
<v Speaker 1>nineties and pretends to be educated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

21
00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.010
<v Speaker 1>it has our kind of high blown way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking and he's a fraud through and </v>

23
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.010
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

24
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>And he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got this,</v>

25
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sidekick who is barely there at all and </v>

26
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't treat him that well,</v>

27
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>but he's got someone to Lord it over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that keeps his dominance hierarchy </v>

28
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.901
<v Speaker 1>thing going well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that he's like a second </v>

29
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:20.991
<v Speaker 1>rate companion while he never really </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed is that although he'll treat </v>

30
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>them contemptuously whenever he gets the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chats.</v>

31
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.430
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're walking down the street and uh,</v>

32
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Fox is bragging about some crooked thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's done and how he pulled the </v>

34
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.401
<v Speaker 1>wool over someone's eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he confuses that with a wisdom and </v>

35
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:38.451
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that you see this </v>

36
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:41.691
<v Speaker 1>is worth knowing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're preyed upon by a </v>

37
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you will be to some degree at some</v>

38
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:48.471
<v Speaker 1>point in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychopath who will be narcissistic </v>

39
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>will presume that you're stupid and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

40
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>and that you deserve to be taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of because you're naive and </v>

41
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

42
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually a good thing that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

43
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his proof for,</v>

45
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>and I'm saying he because there are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>male psychopaths,</v>

46
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

47
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:08.871
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proof that you're stupid naive is </v>

48
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>that he can take advantage of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like if you were wiser you,</v>

49
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.420
<v Speaker 1>you'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd know his tricks and then it </v>

51
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.201
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be morally necessary for him to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show you just exactly who knows what </v>

52
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:22.341
<v Speaker 1>about what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the psychopath will use his </v>

53
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>ability to fool you as proof of his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandiose,</v>

54
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>grandiose omnipotence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>omniscience and narcissism.</v>

55
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be fooled by a psychopath and </v>

56
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>virtually anybody can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that Robert Hare,</v>

57
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:41.301
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who studied psychopaths for a long time </v>

58
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>and interviewed a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hundreds of them and videotape many</v>

59
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>of the interviews he said when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to the psychopath,</v>

60
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>he always believed what they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

61
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.160
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd watched the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and see where the </v>

62
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>conversation went off the rails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

63
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.210
<v Speaker 1>the pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proclivity to be polite in a </v>

64
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>conversation is very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're polite,</v>

65
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>you don't object to the way that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person unfolds their strategy,</v>

66
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:09.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and psychopaths are pretty good at </v>

67
00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:12.181
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to manipulate obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to manipulate people and the </v>

68
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>probability that you will be immune to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is extraordinarily low.</v>

69
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Go Watch Paul Bernardo being interviewed</v>
<v Speaker 1>by policemen on,</v>

70
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bloody,</v>

71
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>that's enlightening man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Bernardo,</v>

72
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 1>he's like the CEO of a meeting in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

73
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives the cops hell.</v>

74
00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>It gives the lawyers hell protested his </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocence.</v>

75
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:35.131
<v Speaker 1>He basically tells them that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>rude and untrustworthy because they </v>

76
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:39.931
<v Speaker 1>don't trust him because he did a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>little things 17 years ago and he gets </v>

77
00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few little things,</v>

78
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he killed a bunch of people,</v>

80
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:46.040
<v Speaker 1>including the sister of his girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time and you know,</v>

81
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>he was a repeat sexual offender and </v>
<v Speaker 1>murderer.</v>

82
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he basically goes,</v>

83
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>that's a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're,</v>

85
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>we're past that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't we?</v>

86
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a discussion with you.</v>

87
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to solve help you solve some </v>
<v Speaker 1>crimes,</v>

88
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>which by the way I committed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we won't bring that up,</v>

89
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>

90
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're accusing me of being a liar,</v>

91
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>like you're not playing fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with you?</v>

92
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>And then when they answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looks at his fingernails,</v>

93
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:14.221
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lovely little manipulative </v>

94
00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:16.801
<v Speaker 1>thing because it basically means </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens to be under my </v>

95
00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:20.101
<v Speaker 1>fingernail at the moment is much higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>priority than listening to your foolish </v>

96
00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:24.241
<v Speaker 1>story and you watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see people do that to you and </v>

97
00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:24.241
<v Speaker 1>then you get a little insight into what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're up to.</v>

98
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 1>He's very good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

99
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>or he looks outside or are you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at his hands and he looks out the</v>

100
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:32.950
<v Speaker 1>window immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dismissive in his nonverbal behavior.</v>

101
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant that the courts were </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced to release that by the way,</v>

102
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>but look it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Bernardo on Youtube.</v>

103
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

104
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.180
<v Speaker 1>it's just mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

105
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.260
<v Speaker 1>he's so good at what he does and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good looking and he's charismatic and </v>

106
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can really pull it off and you can't </v>

107
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.150
<v Speaker 1>tell what's happening with the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the lawyers,</v>

108
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.931
<v Speaker 1>whether they're just letting them play </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a routine to get some information </v>

109
00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 1>from him or whether he's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting them back on his heels.</v>

110
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect it's a bit of both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a masterful performance.</v>

111
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't know who he was and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were watching it without the audio,</v>

112
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:12.511
<v Speaker 1>you'd think he's the CEO of some company</v>
<v Speaker 1>given its employees hell for not being </v>

113
00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>up to scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all his body language,</v>

114
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.860
<v Speaker 1>his eye contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything just speaks that it's </v>

115
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.860
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
