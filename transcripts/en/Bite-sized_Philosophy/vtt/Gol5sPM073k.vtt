1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.350
<v Speaker 1>This is a critical issue with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shamanic transformation is that </v>

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.040
<v Speaker 1>people go through these terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible experiences,</v>

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.990
<v Speaker 1>often drug induced by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the [inaudible].</v>

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>They usually use psychedelic chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 1>of one form or another,</v>

5
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:18.561
<v Speaker 1>often mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've come up with some very </v>

6
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:21.231
<v Speaker 1>strange concoctions like Iowasca down in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Amazon and Iowasca has an amazing </v>

7
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:26.211
<v Speaker 1>substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of the bark of one thing </v>

8
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 1>and another plant whose name I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that hardly even grow in the </v>

9
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.681
<v Speaker 1>same place and that has to be cooked </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in a special way and no one has</v>

10
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>any idea how the damn Amazonians figured</v>
<v Speaker 1>that out.</v>

11
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>It looks impossible and if you ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

12
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plants told us how to do it,</v>

13
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>which was western people don't find very</v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful,</v>

14
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:48.171
<v Speaker 1>but the shamans are perfectly healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy with that description and Iowasca </v>

15
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>takes them apart and it does that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part because it effects the serotonergic</v>

16
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>system very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerfully.</v>

17
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Like all psychedelics do and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>transports them to another world and </v>

18
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>that's how they interpreted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

19
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

20
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>and what we know about psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put in a thimble and then throw </v>

21
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>the thimble away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know nothing about psychedelics,</v>

22
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>so there's new experiments going on at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Johns Hopkins,</v>

23
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:13.950
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with suicide,</v>

24
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>but in which is part of this active </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical in magic mushrooms,</v>

25
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.340
<v Speaker 1>same structure basically as Lsd and </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine and all the real psychedelics </v>

26
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.241
<v Speaker 1>have basically the same structure except</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that's derived from Anita </v>

27
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Mascara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called muscular kinic acid and </v>

28
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.331
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's its own weird thing that no one </v>

29
00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:32.331
<v Speaker 1>knows anything about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

30
00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 1>they have profound neurochemical effects</v>
<v Speaker 1>in very small doses and I'm the research</v>

31
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 1>group at Johns Hopkins has given </v>
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin to research subjects,</v>

32
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 1>purified psilocybin because they started</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new experimentation with </v>

33
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.161
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics and that's been banned for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 40 years because psychedelics were </v>

34
00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>so terrifying to our culture that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>just put them away and it's like,</v>

35
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going there.</v>

36
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>And so even from a research perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even though some of the psychedelics</v>

37
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:01.050
<v Speaker 1>look very promising for the treatment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorders like alcoholism,</v>

38
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.320
<v Speaker 1>they recently used psilocybin to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>people stop smoking down at Johns </v>

39
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Hopkins and I think they had an 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent success rate.</v>

40
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Which is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just absolutely mind boggling and</v>

41
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:13.410
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you give people silicide and they</v>

42
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:18.411
<v Speaker 1>have a mystical experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very common among people who </v>

43
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:21.921
<v Speaker 1>take these sorts of chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then their personality transforms </v>

44
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>permanently such that one year later </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're one standard deviation,</v>

45
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:30.201
<v Speaker 1>higher in openness and openness is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity dimension and that seems to </v>

46
00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:32.530
<v Speaker 1>be a permanent transformation and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really remarkable.</v>

47
00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:37.531
<v Speaker 1>And about 80 percent of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergo the Johns Hopkins Experiments </v>

48
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:42.651
<v Speaker 1>report that the experience is like one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the two or three most important </v>

49
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>things they've ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's never ever happened to them.</v>

50
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

51
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>that's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:52.191
<v Speaker 1>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this guy named Rick </v>

53
00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:54.501
<v Speaker 1>strassman down at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was at the University of </v>

54
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Texas and he did experimentation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>DMT,</v>

55
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>

56
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Mathilde tryptamine I remember if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember correctly,</v>

57
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>is the active ingredient in Iowasca and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you produce it in your brain and it's in</v>

58
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a very common chemical,</v>

59
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.620
<v Speaker 1>but DMT is a weird hallucinogen because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it has an extraordinary short mechanism </v>

60
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>of action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

61
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>and people who take it report that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're blasted out of their body,</v>

62
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.500
<v Speaker 1>like out of a cannon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they go out somewhere and </v>

63
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.901
<v Speaker 1>encounter beings of various sorts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then 10 minutes later they're back and </v>

64
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>virtually everyone reports that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really strange.</v>

65
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:33.181
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so straussman was giving people dmt </v>

66
00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>intravenously so that the trip would </v>
<v Speaker 1>last longer.</v>

67
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was all,</v>

68
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.770
<v Speaker 1>all nih funded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.020
<v Speaker 1>experimentation all cleared with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant ethics boards all conducted </v>

70
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.020
<v Speaker 1>within the last 10 years.</v>

71
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And he basically quit doing it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a pretty straight scientists,</v>

72
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was measuring heart rate and pulse </v>

73
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.491
<v Speaker 1>and all that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to look at the physiology and </v>

74
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:56.251
<v Speaker 1>then the people he was giving these </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals to kept coming back and </v>

75
00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 1>telling them these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these crazy stories.</v>

76
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it just,</v>

77
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>it was too much for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>because they all said the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'd say,</v>

80
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a dream.</v>

81
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>And they'd say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was the most real thing that ever</v>

82
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 1>happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'd say,</v>

83
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>it's an archetypal experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'd say,</v>

85
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

86
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was no archetypal experience.</v>

87
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:19.771
<v Speaker 1>I went somewhere else and I saw things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm back and I don't care what you </v>

88
00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>think and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell knows?</v>

89
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's all subjective.</v>

90
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the weird thing about it is that </v>

91
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>everyone's reporting the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the hell do you account for that?</v>

92
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 1>And then the shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 1>when they take these psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals,</v>

94
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>they basically say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

95
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it more or less killed me.</v>

96
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.530
<v Speaker 1>That's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

97
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I dissolved to the skeleton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I climbed a tree that Unites </v>

98
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Heaven and earth and I went into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realm of the gods and they gave me some </v>

99
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 1>information and I'm back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

100
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

101
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know what to make of </v>

102
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we certainly.</v>

103
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what len describes when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>describes the shamonic,</v>

104
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 1>this romantic procession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the shamanic initiation.</v>

105
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:04.921
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's dissolution to a skeleton first </v>

106
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>and then like a death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this symbolic death or experienced as an</v>

107
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:11.011
<v Speaker 1>actual death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then bang up into the realm of the </v>

108
00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:11.011
<v Speaker 1>gods and then they come back.</v>

109
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a very old idea and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>medieval representation of the tunnel </v>

110
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>that people travel through at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life to,</v>

111
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find the light,</v>

112
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>which is a very common near death </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience report.</v>

113
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 1>And people don't have any idea what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell to do with those reports except </v>

114
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

115
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 1>it's the paroxysms of the dying brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you'd expect to be a hell of a lot</v>

116
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:35.671
<v Speaker 1>more random in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is there's a rebirth after </v>

117
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:39.451
<v Speaker 1>that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here this is the Scandinavian </v>

118
00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 1>representation of that tree that unites </v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth with heaven.</v>

119
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this Scandinavian </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

120
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:49.261
<v Speaker 1>has a snake snakes down here eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's the Amazonian </v>

121
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

122
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you account for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

123
00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:58.381
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those pictures are so similar that it's </v>

124
00:05:58.381 --> 00:05:58.381
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beyond belief.</v>

125
00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 1>we lived in trees for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long,</v>

127
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

128
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years,</v>

129
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>and there were lots of snakes around </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

130
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.000
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that reality is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree that's surrounded by a snake is,</v>

131
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 1>that's in house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

132
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>It's down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's deep.</v>

133
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 1>And there's something about it that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

134
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we normally think of truth,</v>

135
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 1>a truth true in an entirely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

136
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that's pretty damn strange.</v>

137
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 1>We'll start with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My son drew this when he was seven years</v>

138
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blew me away man.</v>

139
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had it laminated.</v>

140
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 1>And so here is what it is on the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand side,</v>

141
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:41.381
<v Speaker 1>that's the order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Yin Yang thing that's </v>

142
00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 1>ordered left side chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And those are all mushroom houses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was amazing.</v>

144
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this river that runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>right down the middle,</v>

145
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:53.441
<v Speaker 1>like the line for order and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this tree that goes up </v>

146
00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 1>to heaven and that's having up there.</v>

147
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like there is St Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the pearly gates,</v>

148
00:06:56.751 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 1>there's the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he never went to church,</v>

149
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like what the hell?</v>

150
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a little bug there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes up and down from heaven to earth.</v>

151
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.920
<v Speaker 1>And that was him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he had a very organized </v>

152
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.920
<v Speaker 1>psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kid,</v>

153
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.400
<v Speaker 1>he was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very stable kid and still is and know he</v>

154
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.440
<v Speaker 1>drew that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

155
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just bloody well,</v>

156
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.690
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I still think that when I look at </v>

157
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.691
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a great example of an </v>

158
00:07:25.691 --> 00:07:25.940
<v Speaker 1>archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll see you Tuesday.</v>
