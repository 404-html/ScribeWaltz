1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Buddha's farther is visited by an angel </v>
<v Speaker 1>who tells him that his son is going to </v>

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.651
<v Speaker 1>grow up to be the greatest temporal </v>
<v Speaker 1>profane ruler of the world has ever seen</v>

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>or a great spiritual leader and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

4
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Being a pragmatic and conservative man </v>
<v Speaker 1>decides that there's no possible way.</v>

5
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:22.101
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to allow my son to take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambivalent road of spiritual </v>

6
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:26.750
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to allow him to fall </v>

7
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.811
<v Speaker 1>completely in love with the world so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he will remain attached to his </v>

8
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So prior to Buddha's birth,</v>

9
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.840
<v Speaker 1>his father constructs a great city with </v>
<v Speaker 1>walls around it and inside that city he </v>

10
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>removes all signs of pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration,</v>

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>and disappointment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any sign of ugliness,</v>

12
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:50.631
<v Speaker 1>the end aids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only people that are allowed to </v>

13
00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:53.600
<v Speaker 1>exist within the city or those who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>in perfect mental and physical health </v>

14
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>who are paragons of beauty and virtue.</v>

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.370
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that lurks behind that </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal story is that when a father </v>

16
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>has a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the his moral obligation is to shield </v>

17
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:12.561
<v Speaker 1>the developing consciousness of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>child from contact with any of the </v>

18
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:16.671
<v Speaker 1>horrors of life that could provide the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child with an experience too traumatic </v>

19
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:22.461
<v Speaker 1>for that developing consciousness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>apprehend so because it's an archetypal </v>

20
00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:26.481
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it relates to the development of all </v>

21
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:26.481
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the redemptive savior,</v>

22
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 1>and that's the motif that the Buddhist </v>
<v Speaker 1>story initially follows.</v>

23
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.280
<v Speaker 1>A good father makes his child fall in </v>
<v Speaker 1>love with life by enticing that child </v>

24
00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>into a direct relationship with all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>life has to offer.</v>

25
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.120
<v Speaker 1>So Buddha grows up within this walled </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden.</v>

26
00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:46.121
<v Speaker 1>It's unselfconscious paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but precisely because he's been shielded</v>

27
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.170
<v Speaker 1>to this degree and allowed to mature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His consciousness continues to expand </v>

28
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>and the world outside the boundaries </v>
<v Speaker 1>that his parents have established for </v>

29
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>him starts to attract his attention.</v>

30
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Now we know already that the forbidden </v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit,</v>

31
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:06.561
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lawyer of what's outside the walls </v>

32
00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>is something that human beings just </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't keep their mangy little paws off.</v>

33
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are absolutely uncontrollably curious</v>

34
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>and the best way to make sure that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigate something is to lay down a </v>

35
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>stricture that says whatever you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>under whatever circumstances,</v>

36
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>never look there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

37
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>and then the automatic systems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlie our orienting and that motivate</v>

38
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:30.501
<v Speaker 1>our seeking experience are constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling our attention precisely to that </v>

39
00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:34.251
<v Speaker 1>forbidden spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling us to investigate exactly </v>

40
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:37.941
<v Speaker 1>that which has been forbidden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because Buddha is a consciousness </v>

41
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:42.771
<v Speaker 1>developing in a healthy manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he immediately becomes curious about </v>

42
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:47.001
<v Speaker 1>what lies beyond the the limits that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been established with him and he </v>

43
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>makes a decision to go outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paradise.</v>

44
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which seems a particularly ridiculous </v>

45
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.571
<v Speaker 1>thing to do given that in principle he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has everything he could possibly want </v>

46
00:02:56.571 --> 00:03:00.110
<v Speaker 1>inside the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then again we have the troublesome </v>

47
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>notion of the original sin of Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Which is that if any of you were offered</v>
<v Speaker 1>a forbidden fruit,</v>

49
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.840
<v Speaker 1>again under circumstances mythologically</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to those that are obtained in</v>

50
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:15.241
<v Speaker 1>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd immediately reach your hand out </v>

51
00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:17.431
<v Speaker 1>and take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what we haven't got for human </v>

52
00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>beings is always far more compelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>than what we have got.</v>

53
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>So Buddha goes outside the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his father,</v>

54
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 1>who's a good father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although somewhat conservative,</v>

55
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:35.011
<v Speaker 1>decides he's going to rig the game a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit so it gets rid of everybody </v>

56
00:03:35.011 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>that's diseased or unhappy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable or ugly rolled or anything</v>

57
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>that could possibly disturb the Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any lines,</v>

58
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:45.151
<v Speaker 1>the streets with flower waving women and</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts pedals on the road and census,</v>

59
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>son out into gilded chariot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the gods who are lurking around </v>

60
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.641
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the troublemaking gods who represent </v>

61
00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>chaos and disorder in the unknown decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stand in front of Buddha.</v>

62
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 1>A sick man who hobbles unsteadily </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview and Buddha asks,</v>

63
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:05.071
<v Speaker 1>is his retainer precisely what this </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena represent sound?</v>

64
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>His retainer says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

65
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings like you,</v>

66
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:14.851
<v Speaker 1>sincere human are subject to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deterioration of these physical powers </v>

67
00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:19.530
<v Speaker 1>in an arbitrary way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this man is one person who's being </v>

68
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 1>so affected.</v>

69
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.630
<v Speaker 1>And so buddha is completely disenchanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>by his exploratory move out into the </v>

70
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:30.301
<v Speaker 1>terrible unknown and runs back into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>castle walls and shuts the door and is </v>

71
00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Speaker 1>perfectly happy to think of nothing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

72
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>But then as his anxiety habituates and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his curiosity grows,</v>

73
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 1>he can't stand the notion of never going</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the walls again and outside.</v>

74
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:44.671
<v Speaker 1>He goes again and this time where after </v>
<v Speaker 1>his father prepares the route ever so </v>

75
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:49.771
<v Speaker 1>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the godsend insight and old man who </v>

76
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:52.891
<v Speaker 1>hobbles interview and mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks at him in shock and horror and </v>

77
00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 1>says to his retainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just precisely what's going on here.</v>

78
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 1>And His retainer says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

79
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>that's an old man and everybody gets old</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to get old too.</v>

80
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:06.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way of all humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the point at which voted.</v>

81
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Self consciousness expands not to only </v>
<v Speaker 1>include the possibility of degeneration,</v>

82
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 1>but to include the temporal horizon </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's characteristic of life.</v>

83
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.930
<v Speaker 1>And he finds that so terribly shocking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he runs back into the castle and </v>

84
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>shuts the walls down and plays with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends for another six months,</v>

85
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Speaker 1>maybe a year till his anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally habituates.</v>

86
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:31.130
<v Speaker 1>And he goes out one final time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this time the godsend,</v>

87
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>a funeral parade for him and he sees his</v>
<v Speaker 1>first dad body.</v>

88
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:41.161
<v Speaker 1>And this is such a terrible shock to him</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he can't even go back to the </v>

89
00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:44.941
<v Speaker 1>castle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his father prepares for him a great </v>

90
00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>party in the woods near the castle full </v>
<v Speaker 1>of nude dancing.</v>

91
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:51.691
<v Speaker 1>Women who are perfectly willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>flaunt themselves into offer themselves </v>

92
00:05:51.691 --> 00:05:55.171
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Buddha is so absolutely </v>

93
00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:57.550
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really shocked by this notion of </v>

94
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.911
<v Speaker 1>emergent death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he can't take any pleasure </v>

95
00:05:59.911 --> 00:05:59.911
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever and what's being offered to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

96
00:05:59.911 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>And he leaves the kingdom once and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

97
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

98
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what happens to you when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you grow up.</v>

99
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're reasonably well socialized and</v>

100
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:13.691
<v Speaker 1>properly looked after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your curiosity gets the better of </v>

101
00:06:13.691 --> 00:06:16.451
<v Speaker 1>you and you keep going out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world until what year parents have </v>

102
00:06:16.451 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 1>established for you is no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient for you.</v>

103
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence of that movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>own into the world,</v>

104
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>you find out all sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of your own life that not</v>

105
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:28.290
<v Speaker 1>only your parents can't precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>explained to you,</v>

106
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.460
<v Speaker 1>but even the broader formal structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your culture have a very difficult </v>

107
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.441
<v Speaker 1>time handling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you finally do encounter such </v>

108
00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:41.651
<v Speaker 1>realities and allow their effect on you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fully manifest itself well then </v>

109
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>you're finally independent and you no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer can return home,</v>

110
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.310
<v Speaker 1>but from that point forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are also burdened as Adam is </v>

111
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.061
<v Speaker 1>burdened when he loses his Paradise Hill</v>
<v Speaker 1>unselfconscious snus with the full </v>

112
00:06:55.061 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 1>revelation of what it means to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited and alive.</v>

113
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.520
<v Speaker 1>So what happens to Buddha as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of this revelation,</v>

114
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.270
<v Speaker 1>he becomes an apprentice and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronicles of the Buddhist adventure are</v>

115
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:13.331
<v Speaker 1>careful to say that he becomes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's most proficient practitioner of </v>

116
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:18.851
<v Speaker 1>Sam [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a philosophical precursor to </v>

117
00:07:18.851 --> 00:07:21.941
<v Speaker 1>yoga and then to yoga so he masters all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the positions and the asanas until he's </v>

118
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 1>disciplined physically to an almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlimited degree.</v>

119
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.850
<v Speaker 1>And then he decides that he'll adopt a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stance of world renunciation,</v>

120
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:31.010
<v Speaker 1>which is also something he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkably good at,</v>

121
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.250
<v Speaker 1>and he starved himself until the chronic</v>
<v Speaker 1>lewis say he resembles nothing so much </v>

122
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.420
<v Speaker 1>as a pile of dust and then having </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhausted all the disciplinary </v>

123
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 1>structures that his sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture has to offer him,</v>

124
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:47.810
<v Speaker 1>but still not precisely finding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer that he's looking for.</v>

125
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.930
<v Speaker 1>He retreats into the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place of the unknown and sits himself </v>

126
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.190
<v Speaker 1>at the base of a tree underneath the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>

127
00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:00.190
<v Speaker 1>He's visited by visions and temptations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first vision is an essentially </v>

128
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.451
<v Speaker 1>erotic one life itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>camps him back out of his self conscious</v>

129
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:07.430
<v Speaker 1>state into the domain of pure physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>

130
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 1>a perfectly reasonable temptation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

131
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.920
<v Speaker 1>and one that's powerful enough so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindu philosophers say,</v>

132
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:18.460
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as their churches and cathedrals are </v>

133
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.891
<v Speaker 1>covered with erotic drawings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't get past the erotic </v>

134
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:24.521
<v Speaker 1>drawings into the church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the domain that you should still </v>

135
00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:27.581
<v Speaker 1>inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in the dawning phases of life at </v>

136
00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:30.641
<v Speaker 1>least till middle age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the appropriate motive being to </v>

137
00:08:30.641 --> 00:08:33.050
<v Speaker 1>be enticed and seduced by the physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasures that life has to offer,</v>

138
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.200
<v Speaker 1>but in the final analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are not sufficient to solve the </v>

139
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.510
<v Speaker 1>problem of emergent self consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the angel of death visits him and</v>

140
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:46.511
<v Speaker 1>offered him the opportunity to exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently in a state of Nirvana.</v>

141
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting twist on the story </v>

142
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.061
<v Speaker 1>because you have to wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given the association saved between </v>

143
00:08:55.061 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>suicidality and the notion of paradise </v>
<v Speaker 1>that exists underneath that.</v>

144
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.290
<v Speaker 1>If what Buddha isn't being offered by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the angel of death is in fact death and </v>

145
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>the cessation of all the problems of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being regardless,</v>

146
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
<v Speaker 1>he rejects that attains enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 1>briefly and then decides to return to </v>

147
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 1>the world to share what he's discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all of suffering humanity.</v>

148
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 1>The idea being that the Buddha who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the awakened or enlightened one,</v>

149
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 1>is capable of attaining a transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

150
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:27.801
<v Speaker 1>but also knows fully that because human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have a shared social aspect,</v>

151
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.400
<v Speaker 1>it is not possible for any one person to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attain redemption until all people </v>

152
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.931
<v Speaker 1>attain redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason being that it's very </v>

153
00:09:38.931 --> 00:09:41.901
<v Speaker 1>difficult to be transcendent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened when you see someone who's </v>

154
00:09:41.901 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 1>sick lying in a ditch.</v>
