1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.530
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I want to talk about postmodernism a</v>

2
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:07.880
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that's my youth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michel Foucault in the Middle,</v>

4
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:16.101
<v Speaker 1>and the more reprehensible individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could partly ever discover or even </v>

5
00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:20.961
<v Speaker 1>dream up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how twisted your imagination </v>

6
00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>and a food co and Dera Dahlia would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more,</v>

7
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>but I would say they're the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>architects of the,</v>

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the postmodernist movement,</v>

9
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:33.891
<v Speaker 1>and in brief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what they did was in the late </v>

10
00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:37.251
<v Speaker 1>sixties and early seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were avowed Marxist some way low </v>

11
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>way after anyone with any shred of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical decency had stopped being a </v>

12
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:46.521
<v Speaker 1>Marxist by that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even John Paul Sartre and woken up </v>

13
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:49.851
<v Speaker 1>enough to figure out that the Soviets </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't ushered into the Kingdom of </v>

14
00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he had evidence stretching back 45 </v>

15
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.421
<v Speaker 1>years that he could have attended to if </v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have been willing to open his </v>

16
00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:56.421
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about bad faith,</v>

17
00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>which was his ethical critique.</v>

18
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something quite staggering.</v>

19
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>The postmodernists knew that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much done with regards to pushing</v>

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
<v Speaker 1>their classic Marxism by the late </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties in the early seventies because </v>

21
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.480
<v Speaker 1>the evidence that Stella Russia not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stalinists,</v>

22
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>certainly lennon was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no saint by any stretch of the </v>

23
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.801
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That killing certainly got underway </v>

24
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 1>while he was still alive and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>continued after Stalin was dead as well,</v>

25
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>although perhaps with not the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree of brutality and efficiency.</v>

26
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a course Mao's China </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the estimates,</v>

27
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows how many people died under </v>

28
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.511
<v Speaker 1>mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the estimates are run as high as </v>

29
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:38.511
<v Speaker 1>$100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people,</v>

30
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:43.491
<v Speaker 1>which actually turns out to be quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few people in the fact that we can't </v>

31
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:47.121
<v Speaker 1>keep count accurately without an error </v>
<v Speaker 1>margin of something in the tens of </v>

32
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>millions just tells you exactly how </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible the situation was.</v>

33
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.140
<v Speaker 1>They transformed the Marxist dialogue of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich versus poor into oppressed versus </v>

34
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>oppressor and Fuko in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who never fit in anywhere and who was an</v>

35
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>outcast in many ways and a bitter one in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a suicidal one his entire life.</v>

36
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Did everything he possibly could with is</v>
<v Speaker 1>staggering Iq to figure out every </v>

37
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.381
<v Speaker 1>treacherous way possible to undermine </v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure that wouldn't accept him </v>

38
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:19.371
<v Speaker 1>in all his peculiarity and it's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder because there would be no way of </v>

39
00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:23.241
<v Speaker 1>making a structure that could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>function if it was composed of people </v>

40
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>who were as peculiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter and resentful as Michelle Foodco,</v>

41
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 1>so you couldn't imagine this functioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>society that would be composed of </v>

42
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>individuals with his particular makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>

43
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.030
<v Speaker 1>he did put his brain to work trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way how to resurrect </v>

44
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Marxism under a new guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

45
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:44.901
<v Speaker 1>and B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to justify the fact that it wasn't </v>

46
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>his problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was an outsider.</v>

47
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:51.951
<v Speaker 1>It was actually everyone else's problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did a pretty damn good job of </v>

48
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laid the groundwork for this,</v>

49
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

50
00:02:55.171 --> 00:03:00.171
<v Speaker 1>the rise of the marginalized against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>center and is thinking is very much the </v>

51
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

52
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Derek,</v>

53
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.840
<v Speaker 1>even though my fuco and Derrida hated </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and regard each other as </v>

54
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>intellectual charlatans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was about the only thing either of</v>

55
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:14.131
<v Speaker 1>them was ever really correct about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Derrida was also dared in some ways </v>

56
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:22.921
<v Speaker 1>is even more treacherous thinker because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes the claim in some sense that I </v>

57
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>a political system has a center around </v>
<v Speaker 1>which the majority congregate.</v>

58
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

59
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>it's quite similar to food co's analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that there are,</v>

60
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.880
<v Speaker 1>there are people who are outside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>category system and then which is </v>

61
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>obviously true because no matter how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>categorize people,</v>

62
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>there are certain people inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>category and certain people outside.</v>

63
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>That's actually why you categorize </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

64
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if every category holds every </v>

65
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.950
<v Speaker 1>entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then every,</v>

66
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>every cognitive operation is infinitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

67
00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.020
<v Speaker 1>You can't manage that way to categorize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to include an excluded.</v>

68
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 1>It's the very nature of categorization </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't just scrap categorization </v>

69
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>because without simplification and </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorization,</v>

70
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>you actually can't function in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

71
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>You just die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

72
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:16.021
<v Speaker 1>You die of excess stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like something like that </v>

73
00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:19.261
<v Speaker 1>happens to schizophrenia people because </v>
<v Speaker 1>their category systems break down and </v>

74
00:04:19.261 --> 00:04:22.950
<v Speaker 1>they're completely incapable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning in the world as a </v>

75
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.950
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

76
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

77
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Derrida went and flew co as well,</v>

78
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 1>went a step farther and this is one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the incredibly crooked elements of their</v>

79
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think another slight of hand which was</v>

80
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>well category systems exclude political </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

81
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>exclude economic systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exclude any hierarchy of value.</v>

82
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Excludes obviously because if there is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of value,</v>

83
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:48.761
<v Speaker 1>some things are more valuable than </v>
<v Speaker 1>others and the less valuable things are </v>

84
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:50.260
<v Speaker 1>excluded because otherwise it wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a hierarchy of value.</v>

85
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.740
<v Speaker 1>But the next claim they essentially make</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the reason that those </v>

86
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies of value are constructed </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't to produce whatever it is that's a</v>

87
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:04.111
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to exclude and to maintain the </v>

88
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 1>structure of power that's intrinsic to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy of value.</v>

89
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an unbelievably crooked claim </v>

90
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.761
<v Speaker 1>because there are multiple reasons why a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of value might be put into </v>

91
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:18.421
<v Speaker 1>place there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hierarchies of beauty and there's </v>

92
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:20.551
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies of competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies of intelligence and and </v>

93
00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and athletic ability and musical talent.</v>

94
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:28.471
<v Speaker 1>There's multiple hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in order for those things to exist </v>

95
00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:29.680
<v Speaker 1>at a high order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order for us to,</v>

96
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

97
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.300
<v Speaker 1>to laud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

98
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Musical genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to excuse all the people.</v>

99
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:41.461
<v Speaker 1>We have to exclude all the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>can only squawk their clarinet from the </v>

100
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:44.230
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy because otherwise you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any music and there's no option.</v>

101
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:49.231
<v Speaker 1>There's no direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to claim that the purpose of the </v>

102
00:05:49.231 --> 00:05:53.251
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy is to exclude is unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>crooked and it's central claim for both,</v>

103
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.590
<v Speaker 1>for both Fuko and and Dera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those slights of hands </v>

104
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.591
<v Speaker 1>that people don't quite notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that have absolutely catastrophic </v>

105
00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:02.591
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>

106
00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Now for food co and Derrida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

107
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 1>here's how you could imagine their world</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

108
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the philosopher Hobbes,</v>

110
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>life was nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutish and short,</v>

111
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 1>and people were at each other's throats </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the state of nature,</v>

112
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Hobbs really thought about that as </v>

113
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.230
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

114
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 1>as the chaos of individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he believed that a central authority</v>

115
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:31.481
<v Speaker 1>had to exert force in order to organize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that intrinsic chaos so that some degree</v>

116
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:36.551
<v Speaker 1>of peace could rain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of the opposite of John Shaw </v>

117
00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 1>crusoe's theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was that human beings were </v>

118
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.371
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically good and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the state the government was </v>

119
00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:45.851
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that all of what made people evil </v>

120
00:06:45.851 --> 00:06:46.180
<v Speaker 1>derive from the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

121
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 1>I would say if you put hobbes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rousseau together,</v>

122
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 1>you actually get the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they do seem to be coming at</v>

123
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:58.031
<v Speaker 1>it from opposite perspectives because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are actually good and evil and </v>

124
00:06:58.031 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 1>social structures are also good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

125
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.690
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's paradoxical and we don't like </v>

126
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 1>paradoxical categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's still how it is.</v>

127
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Fuco and Derrida and the </v>

128
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.240
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists did was that they kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>added the collective element to that.</v>

129
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:16.241
<v Speaker 1>So there are hobbsy and world isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>world of individuals struggling against </v>

130
00:07:16.241 --> 00:07:18.320
<v Speaker 1>one another in the initial state of war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nature.</v>

131
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:23.321
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's groups of individuals bound by </v>

132
00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:26.411
<v Speaker 1>whatever their identity happens to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling against each other for power.</v>

133
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Because in the postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxist universe,</v>

134
00:07:30.031 --> 00:07:35.031
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing but power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a variety of reasons for </v>

135
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:38.801
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly it's because the postmodernists </v>

136
00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 1>don't admit that there are any standards</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of arbitrary opinion,</v>

137
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.390
<v Speaker 1>essentially they don't really believe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real world,</v>

138
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:47.060
<v Speaker 1>which is why they can generate critiques</v>
<v Speaker 1>of science,</v>

139
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:52.061
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is increasingly characterized is </v>

140
00:07:52.061 --> 00:07:52.950
<v Speaker 1>nothing but part of the euro centric </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchies,</v>

141
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:58.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call desire to impose </v>

142
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.761
<v Speaker 1>their power structure on the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world despite the fact that it also </v>

143
00:08:00.761 --> 00:08:02.170
<v Speaker 1>makes planes fly and computers operate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

144
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

146
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.940
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a rare bloody,</v>

147
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warrior that doesn't have</v>

148
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.840
<v Speaker 1>an iphone or a android,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't work if quantum mechanics </v>

149
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.591
<v Speaker 1>wasn't actually correct because the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that quantum mechanics is correct is one</v>

150
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:25.601
<v Speaker 1>of the reasons why these unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly developed pieces of technology </v>

151
00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:29.741
<v Speaker 1>actually functioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they bitch and whine about the </v>

152
00:08:29.741 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal underpinnings of Eurocentric</v>

153
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Science and use the gadgets all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>to aggregate,</v>

154
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:38.870
<v Speaker 1>to complain about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really pretty appalling.</v>

155
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

156
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:45.491
<v Speaker 1>the worldview of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the postmodern neo marxists is that </v>

157
00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:48.611
<v Speaker 1>everybody is basically not an individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's really a fiction.</v>

158
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 1>And a eurocentric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal fiction at that,</v>

159
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:56.501
<v Speaker 1>but a member of whatever their identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>group happens to be and there's no real </v>

160
00:08:56.501 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 1>possibility of communication between </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity groups,</v>

161
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.980
<v Speaker 1>hence phenomena like cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriation.</v>

162
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a war of all groups against </v>
<v Speaker 1>all groups and it's all,</v>

163
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing but a struggle for power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there is no higher order ethic to be</v>

164
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.130
<v Speaker 1>referred to because for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists,</v>

165
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no such thing as a higher order</v>

166
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>ethic.</v>

167
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 1>There is no such thing as a uniting </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>

168
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:21.510
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hallmark of their thinking.</v>

169
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

170
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:27.141
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work out in practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>because without an ethic or a higher </v>

171
00:09:27.141 --> 00:09:30.621
<v Speaker 1>order value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't anything you can do with </v>

172
00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:30.621
<v Speaker 1>your life because you keep undermining </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

173
00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 1>If everything's just a whim and </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective,</v>

174
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:37.791
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no hierarchy of values than </v>

175
00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:37.791
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you do when you get up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

176
00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:39.690
<v Speaker 1>if one thing isn't better than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

177
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:44.691
<v Speaker 1>you might as well just lay there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>smother yourself with a pillow would be </v>

178
00:09:44.691 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 1>a lot easier than opening your eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling in the world.</v>

179
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's so it's completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a self defeating philosophy and I </v>

180
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:56.571
<v Speaker 1>think that's part of the reason why it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less self evident that it's a </v>

181
00:09:56.571 --> 00:09:59.721
<v Speaker 1>mask for the continuation of Marxism </v>
<v Speaker 1>because at least Marxism has as one of </v>

182
00:09:59.721 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 1>its advantages at direction.</v>

183
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.500
<v Speaker 1>It's an ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

184
00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:07.501
<v Speaker 1>Do you have something to struggle </v>
<v Speaker 1>against even though what you're </v>

185
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 1>struggling against is certainly one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that you actually rely on and</v>

186
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:13.821
<v Speaker 1>second something that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>oversimplify in a very ungrateful and </v>

187
00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 1>resentful way to justify fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>against it to begin with.</v>

188
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:21.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's especially true in western </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures because as pathological as they</v>

189
00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:26.331
<v Speaker 1>certainly are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is approximately as pathological </v>

190
00:10:26.331 --> 00:10:29.061
<v Speaker 1>as all of you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot less pathological than </v>

191
00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:32.031
<v Speaker 1>almost everything that's ever happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pretty much everything that's </v>

192
00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:33.180
<v Speaker 1>currently happening elsewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

193
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.360
<v Speaker 1>And you can kind of tell that by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that people tend to come to </v>

194
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.000
<v Speaker 1>immigrate to the West rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse.</v>

195
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 1>the postmodern new Marxists would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>an answer to that,</v>

197
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:46.170
<v Speaker 1>which would be the only reason the west </v>
<v Speaker 1>functions is because it's raped the rest</v>

198
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of humanity and the planet.</v>

199
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:49.440
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less said about that,</v>

201
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:54.210
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>
