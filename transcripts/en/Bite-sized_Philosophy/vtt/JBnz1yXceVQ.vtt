1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's in the 19 twenties.</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>It's after the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After World War One rushes in pretty bad</v>

3
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:10.971
<v Speaker 1>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The villages are full of brutalized men </v>

4
00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:13.641
<v Speaker 1>who have posttraumatic stress disorder </v>
<v Speaker 1>and lots of people who are not doing </v>

5
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>well at all and the bloody intellectuals</v>
<v Speaker 1>come into the town and they say,</v>

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those successful farmers up the street </v>

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.450
<v Speaker 1>that you've always been pretty jealous </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in your useless manner while </v>

8
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>they're actually pigs and demons who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing from you,</v>

9
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:31.161
<v Speaker 1>so why don't you come out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll form a nice little mob and we'll </v>

10
00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>take everything they've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happened.</v>

11
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:36.921
<v Speaker 1>And all those people were killed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>raped or set off to Siberia in the </v>

12
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:40.611
<v Speaker 1>middle of the bloody winter where there </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't even anything for them to to </v>

13
00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>anywhere for them to live or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to eat.</v>

14
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>So they all died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the consequence of that was a </v>

15
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>few years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>6 million people starved to death in the</v>

16
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine.</v>

17
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>And Malcolm Muggeridge had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporting on that since the 19 thirties.</v>

18
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.650
<v Speaker 1>And so that was the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the first wind really that the </v>

19
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Speaker 1>west God of exactly what was happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union,</v>

20
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>but even at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bloody left wing intellectuals in </v>

21
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.281
<v Speaker 1>North America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're so damn clueless and in Europe </v>

22
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:07.281
<v Speaker 1>that they never paid much attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it with,</v>

23
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>with the exception of certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like George Orwell,</v>

24
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.140
<v Speaker 1>who wrote 1984 and animal farm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course a discussion.</v>

25
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>The main pig in animal farm is stalad </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>

26
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>and it's a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an allegory about the Russian revolution</v>

27
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.970
<v Speaker 1>whose basic motif is we're all equal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course some all animals are </v>

28
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.411
<v Speaker 1>equal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some are more equal than others and </v>

29
00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>that's the motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Motif of animal farm.</v>

30
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>So there had been warnings all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

31
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:41.001
<v Speaker 1>right from the beginning of the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution to the West about exactly </v>

32
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:41.001
<v Speaker 1>what was going on.</v>

33
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>But because Communist and Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology is very good at Adelaide and </v>

34
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>the at the week binds of idiot </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals,</v>

35
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>there was a huge section of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population who was fomenting,</v>

36
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the standard.</v>

37
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>What would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Political,</v>

38
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>psychological and social order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who were absolutely committed to the </v>

39
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:05.571
<v Speaker 1>ethic that's encased in statements like </v>
<v Speaker 1>from each according to his ability to </v>

40
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:09.411
<v Speaker 1>each according to his need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sounds perfectly wonderful if you </v>

41
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:12.651
<v Speaker 1>think about it for about 15 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you think about it for six </v>

42
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:15.861
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes unbelievably murderous and its </v>

43
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:15.861
<v Speaker 1>reach and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

44
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>and the intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>

45
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:23.151
<v Speaker 1>the French for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be particularly opaque to </v>

46
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>

47
00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>the doctrine of Pol Pot in Cambodia that</v>
<v Speaker 1>also killed about 6 million people hit.</v>

49
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>So what they did in Cambodia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the revolution occurred was decided</v>

50
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:38.781
<v Speaker 1>that everyone in the city were parasites</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the countryside because the </v>

51
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>countryside full of farmers was where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the primary production was taking place.</v>

52
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 1>And they regarded the city dwellers as </v>
<v Speaker 1>parasites on that fundamental </v>

53
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.690
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they basically emptied out the cities</v>

54
00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>and set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sent all the people in the cities out to</v>

55
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>work in the country as forced labor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And 6 million people died there.</v>

56
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:58.011
<v Speaker 1>And the chief architect of that bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>project got his phd from the Sorbonne </v>

57
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>and said exactly what he was going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he went back to Cambodia,</v>

58
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.330
<v Speaker 1>was cheered along by the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals who thought that that was </v>

59
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>just a fine idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's all background for why I don't</v>

60
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>think any of you guys really know much </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 20th century history.</v>

61
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.680
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened in the 19 seventies when </v>

62
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.390
<v Speaker 1>when Soulja Nansen published the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 1>archipelago was the.</v>

63
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.640
<v Speaker 1>It was so brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book and so overwhelming and it's </v>

64
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.740
<v Speaker 1>emotional and intellectual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical power that it became </v>

65
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.331
<v Speaker 1>impossible for anyone to continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim that Marxism slash communism had </v>

66
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>any intellectual or ethical integrity </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

67
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>It was done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was done.</v>

68
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the reason why he won</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nobel Prize.</v>

69
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

70
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>why the Soviet Union collapsed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>once word got out about exactly what was</v>

71
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:56.341
<v Speaker 1>actually going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no way of making a coherent </v>

72
00:03:56.341 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>argument in favor of say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exporting the Worker's revolution around</v>

73
00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:03.061
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the consequence of that was </v>

74
00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:06.150
<v Speaker 1>well documented by social units and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing the western intellectuals tried </v>

75
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.531
<v Speaker 1>to make excuses for what had happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union by blaming it on </v>

76
00:04:10.531 --> 00:04:14.911
<v Speaker 1>Stalin's cult of personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perversion of the original accurate </v>

77
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Marxist doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they basically said,</v>

78
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:23.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lenin had Lenin lived because he died </v>

79
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>quite young and was replaced by Stella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had Lenin lived.</v>

80
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 1>The promised Utopia would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivered,</v>

81
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 1>but solzhenitsyn being an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>genius,</v>

82
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.290
<v Speaker 1>documented the relationship number one </v>
<v Speaker 1>be between the axioms of Marxist and </v>

83
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:40.291
<v Speaker 1>communist thought and the laws that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>generated primarily by Lenin and the and</v>

84
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>the construction of these camps and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dea Kula,</v>

85
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>causation and all the mass murders.</v>

86
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.620
<v Speaker 1>He documented the causal relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between them and laid them clearly at </v>

87
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 1>the feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not of Stalin but of Lenin.</v>

88
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 1>And so that was also a major blow </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it.</v>

89
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:59.341
<v Speaker 1>It undermined the remaining argument of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left wing radical left wing </v>

90
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 1>apologists in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

91
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.520
<v Speaker 1>in the West for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the viability of Marxist slash </v>

92
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>communist doctrines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you still hear people today.</v>

93
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're faced with the,</v>

94
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're,</v>

95
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:15.301
<v Speaker 1>if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're Marxist in their orientation </v>

96
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:17.761
<v Speaker 1>and they're faced with the data </v>
<v Speaker 1>pertaining to what happened in the </v>

97
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:17.761
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say something like,</v>

98
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't real Marxism,</v>

99
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to that is,</v>

100
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

101
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:27.361
<v Speaker 1>except that in every bloody country in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world where that doctrine was </v>

102
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:27.361
<v Speaker 1>implemented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>

103
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:30.540
<v Speaker 1>regardless of the wide cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between the cultures,</v>

104
00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>say the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

105
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Cambodia and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the same thing happened every </v>

106
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.530
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

107
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>And we still have a great example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that today in the form of North Korea.</v>

108
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever looked at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>map of the world at night.</v>

109
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a map of the entire globe at</v>

110
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at South Korea,</v>

111
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:53.281
<v Speaker 1>it's lit up like jewels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing but light like the east </v>

112
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>coast of the United States and Canada </v>
<v Speaker 1>and North Korea is dark,</v>

113
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.880
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 years of barbaric communist despotic </v>

114
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:06.101
<v Speaker 1>rule means a country that's completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>in an industrialized where every single </v>

115
00:06:06.101 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>person is malnourished or starving to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

116
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.510
<v Speaker 1>where everyone lives in terror all the </v>
