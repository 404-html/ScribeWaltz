00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:00.810
<v Speaker 1>On,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.560
<v Speaker 1>is there ever a legitimate use for human</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights tribunal or counsel?</v>

3
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:09.561
<v Speaker 1>And if you could comment also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going forward in the fight over </v>

4
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>gender expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do people combat or,</v>

6
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:16.920
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

7
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>or win that fight in front of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights?</v>

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>courts and tribunals and um,</v>

9
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

10
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.140
<v Speaker 2>we'll leave it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>

11
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 2>there is no excuse for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're called social justice</v>

12
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 2>tribunals in Ontario like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're called.</v>

13
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 2>And so look it up yourself and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they are.</v>

14
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.100
<v Speaker 2>So we had a court system that works </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly well,</v>

15
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.130
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't mean it worked very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it means it works better than any </v>

16
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.461
<v Speaker 2>alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if anyone has ever been able to </v>

17
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:51.561
<v Speaker 2>think up and a human rights tribunal can</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspend nor normal jurisprudential </v>

18
00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 2>standards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use preponderance of evidence.</v>

19
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:58.551
<v Speaker 2>They don't assume individual innocence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can change the rules as they </v>

20
00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:03.261
<v Speaker 2>see fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those bloody things are </v>

21
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:05.661
<v Speaker 2>pathological to the core and their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their mouthpieces of the postmodernist </v>

22
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:09.801
<v Speaker 2>neo Marxists as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're setting up a parallel law </v>

23
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 2>system and they're also doing that</v>

24
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.340
<v Speaker 2>there also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

25
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:20.210
<v Speaker 2>this is the wind government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're also forcing the universities to</v>

26
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 2>adopt particular definitions of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>harassment that make every,</v>

27
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 2>let's call it complicated interchange </v>
<v Speaker 2>between human beings into a act of </v>

28
00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:33.770
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that I'm trying to justify stupidity</v>

29
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:38.771
<v Speaker 2>or oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're all stupid and we're all </v>

30
00:01:38.771 --> 00:01:41.691
<v Speaker 2>oppressors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the probability that we'll make </v>

31
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:43.931
<v Speaker 2>some sort of dopey sexual error is 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent and now that's become grounds </v>

32
00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:44.870
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

33
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:49.871
<v Speaker 2>accusations of rape and where they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>forcing the universities and the </v>

34
00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 2>colleges to become parallel legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems as well.</v>

35
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.680
<v Speaker 2>And that's already well advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's already been adopted at the UFT.</v>

36
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.980
<v Speaker 2>It's as a consequence of direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation and you better look out </v>

37
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.830
<v Speaker 2>because even if the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>running those institutions right now are</v>

38
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 2>reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they're not,</v>

39
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.630
<v Speaker 2>they will absolutely be replaced by </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who exactly want that kind of </v>

40
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.090
<v Speaker 2>power and will absolutely use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>

41
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 2>those things should be abolished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a legal system,</v>

42
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 3>no</v>

43
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.670
<v Speaker 2>law society now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may not have this exactly right,</v>

44
00:02:24.671 --> 00:02:29.671
<v Speaker 2>but I've got it mostly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Lost Society in Ontario has already </v>

45
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:33.001
<v Speaker 2>decided that lawyers are racists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to force them to undergo </v>

46
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.361
<v Speaker 2>on unconscious bias training and they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to and they were agreeing by the </v>

47
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:39.811
<v Speaker 2>way they've already come to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion that because the legal </v>

48
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:43.561
<v Speaker 2>profession does not have the precise </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation that you would expect if </v>

49
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:47.341
<v Speaker 2>you did a demographic analysis of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population according to the terms </v>

50
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:50.410
<v Speaker 2>defined by the social justice warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's racist and that they're racist</v>

51
00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:53.470
<v Speaker 2>and that they need to be trained </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious first.</v>

52
00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:54.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so go ahead.</v>

53
00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Lawyers like lineup man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>admit your guilt.</v>

54
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 2>You're done and you deserve it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
