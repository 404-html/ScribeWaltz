1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.450
<v Speaker 1>And then the worst snake of all his </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence,</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.020
<v Speaker 1>and that's I think that's technically </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct because one of the things that </v>

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>you view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

4
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at posttraumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress disorder,</v>

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>is that it's almost always the case that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who suffers from post traumatic </v>

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.201
<v Speaker 1>stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you might think of as a real real </v>

7
00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:25.041
<v Speaker 1>life re incarnation of the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people encounter something </v>

8
00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 1>malevolent and it breaks them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the worst thing to understand.</v>

9
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like suffering is one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

10
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bad enough.</v>

11
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Vulnerability and suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bad enough,</v>

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.040
<v Speaker 1>but to encounter someone who wishes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon you and will work to bring it </v>

13
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.091
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different category of </v>

14
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:46.251
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it also reflect </v>

15
00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:49.401
<v Speaker 1>something back to you about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if someone else can do that to </v>

16
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:53.931
<v Speaker 1>you and they're human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that you partake of the same </v>

17
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:53.931
<v Speaker 1>essence.</v>

18
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Strangely enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually the cure to some degree,</v>

19
00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>to posttraumatic stress disorder is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've been victimized,</v>

20
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:05.181
<v Speaker 1>you're naive and you've been victimized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way out of that is to no longer be </v>

21
00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.410
<v Speaker 1>naive and to no longer be victimized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means that you.</v>

22
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>You see this reflected in the Harry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Potter idea,</v>

23
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:14.841
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the reason that Harry Potter can </v>

24
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>withstand voldemort is because he's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of a already been touched by it </v>

25
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 1>and the way that you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that you keep the psychopaths at</v>

26
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>bay is to develop the inner psychopaths </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you know when,</v>

27
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>when you see what right and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a voluntary thing.</v>

28
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so.</v>

29
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a a set of tools that you have</v>

30
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>at your disposal which has full </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of evil and that does.</v>

31
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Nina said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look into an abyss for too long,</v>

32
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>you risk having the abyss gaze back into</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

33
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that if you look at </v>

34
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.091
<v Speaker 1>something monstrous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a tendency to turn into a </v>

35
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>monster and people are often very afraid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of looking at monsters.</v>

36
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Things exactly for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the question is,</v>

37
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should you turn into a monster?</v>

38
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>

39
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>but you should do it voluntarily and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally,</v>

40
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.460
<v Speaker 1>and you should do it with the good in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind rather than falling prey to it by </v>

41
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>possession essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the alternative.</v>

42
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And how does it possess you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's easy.</v>

43
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.690
<v Speaker 1>You're suffering makes you better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your bitterness makes you resentful,</v>

44
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>you're resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mate means meat,</v>

45
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>makes you vengeful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you're on that road,</v>

46
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>you go down that a little bit farther,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

47
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.450
<v Speaker 1>while you end up fantasizing in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>basement about shooting up the local </v>

48
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>high school and then killing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Because that's sort of the ultimate end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that line of pathological reasoning.</v>

50
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Beings should be eradicated because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its intrinsic evil.</v>

51
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>And I'm exactly the person to do it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll cap it off with an indication of my</v>

52
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:40.890
<v Speaker 1>own lack of worth just to hammer the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point home.</v>

53
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I can garner a little post post </v>

54
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>post you miss fame along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that'll satisfy my primordial </v>

55
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>primate dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a imaginings to at least in fantasy.</v>

56
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.290
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the full package if you want to go </v>

57
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.290
<v Speaker 1>down that route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course people don't like to think</v>

58
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 1>about that sort of thing and it's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody wonder,</v>

59
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>but without the capability for mayhem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

60
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

61
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>you're a potential victim to mayhem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you need your sword.</v>

62
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.330
<v Speaker 1>It should be sheath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need to have it and it's very </v>

63
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.271
<v Speaker 1>frequently the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you treat someone with posttraumatic </v>

64
00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:15.271
<v Speaker 1>stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

65
00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>There's two things you have to do.</v>

66
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.270
<v Speaker 1>You have to help them develop a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated philosophy of evil because </v>

67
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>otherwise their brain bothers him over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over and over.</v>

68
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why were you so deal with naive?</v>

69
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>How did you become victimized?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why were you such as soccer?</v>

70
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.130
<v Speaker 1>These are good questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to have that happen to </v>

71
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.130
<v Speaker 1>you again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be exploited twice.</v>

72
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your eyes have to open up.</v>

73
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>We know the price of that from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian myth,</v>

74
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come into contact with Seth,</v>

75
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're a god,</v>

76
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>you lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

77
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>it's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

78
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.030
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the cure for that is the </v>

79
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 1>movement down into the underworld and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the revitalization of the father.</v>

80
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>That's the identification with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest that created culture,</v>

81
00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.360
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that then there's you and that </v>

82
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.360
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can withstand malevolence.</v>

83
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can withstand tragedy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence and then that's the whole </v>

84
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.310
<v Speaker 1>secret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

85
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what you want in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to be able to withstand tragedy</v>

86
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.850
<v Speaker 1>and you need to be able to withstand </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence because those are the forces</v>

87
00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>that are always working against you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's.</v>

88
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.250
<v Speaker 1>This is associated with the union idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of incorporation of the shadow,</v>

89
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be.</v>

90
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.080
<v Speaker 1>We know this God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know how predators work with regards </v>

91
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>to children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're a pedophilic Predator and</v>

92
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at a landscape of </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

93
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.390
<v Speaker 1>the child that you're going to go after </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the one that's timid and won't fight </v>

94
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.351
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've picked your victim and predatory </v>

95
00:04:40.351 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>people in general are exactly like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>man there because they're predators.</v>

96
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.730
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to attack someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's who's going to fight back.</v>

97
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue is likely not to even come up.</v>

98
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.600
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be looking for someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>one way or another that cannot </v>

99
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize what they are and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

100
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's open season and it's open season,</v>

101
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 1>and so if you're treating someone with </v>
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>

102
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 1>first they need an introduction to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of malevolence and second,</v>

103
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 1>they have to learn to become dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the only way out.</v>

104
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.180
<v Speaker 1>What's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get these recurrent thoughts about </v>

105
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.551
<v Speaker 1>their vulnerability in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence and their own naive nutty </v>

106
00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:24.600
<v Speaker 1>because by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone psychopathic has exploited </v>

107
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too naive.</v>

108
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a definitional issue.</v>

109
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

110
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:30.340
<v Speaker 1>that's no fault of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the hell could I be prepared?</v>

111
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

112
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Perfectly reasonable objection doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve your problem because it's an.</v>

113
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 1>It's an eternal problem.</v>
