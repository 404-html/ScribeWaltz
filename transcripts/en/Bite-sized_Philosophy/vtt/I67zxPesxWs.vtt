00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Stalin the great father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right wise man at the helm of the ship </v>

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is after the wall came down,</v>

4
00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:13.000
<v Speaker 1>some old man kissing a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gilded statue,</v>

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Stalin before it's going to be before </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be torn down.</v>

6
00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:20.851
<v Speaker 1>There he is with happy children and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the children that his policies starve to</v>

7
00:00:21.701 --> 00:00:22.840
<v Speaker 1>death as you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might.</v>

8
00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Well imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is in his military uniform sitting</v>

9
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Speaker 1>on what's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>

10
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:29.450
<v Speaker 1>a throne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

11
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 1>this is really an uncanny one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very positive,</v>

12
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Hitler is or still in his head of</v>

13
00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:38.110
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in this hellish Mendola of fire.</v>

14
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Perfect with God the father at his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Lennon.</v>

15
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.310
<v Speaker 1>You know who people still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who people still revere.</v>

16
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may know and perhaps you don't,</v>

17
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:50.710
<v Speaker 1>that I was nominated to be rector of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Glasgow.</v>

18
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.960
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an honorary position.</v>

19
00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:57.961
<v Speaker 1>And today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday the different candidates put </v>

20
00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>up their manifestos in the student </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper,</v>

21
00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:06.490
<v Speaker 1>put them up and then wrote analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the manifestos which were biased.</v>

22
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.700
<v Speaker 1>And there were appallingly biased in one</v>
<v Speaker 1>sided.</v>

23
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>And I wrote and told them that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

24
00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:14.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a perfect right to our political</v>

25
00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:14.980
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

26
00:01:14.981 --> 00:01:15.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well for sure,</v>

27
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:20.971
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are journalists after all and maybe </v>

28
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:21.850
<v Speaker 1>you could be just trying to tell what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

29
00:01:21.851 --> 00:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

30
00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

31
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:25.930
<v Speaker 1>there's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said that one of the candidates</v>

32
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:26.770
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>that they clearly recommended who seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a person who's perfectly heroic in</v>

34
00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 1>his own right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's taken on very many difficult</v>

35
00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:39.991
<v Speaker 1>legal cases and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and worked for the oppressed and </v>

36
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:41.000
<v Speaker 1>downtrodden who clearly exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 1>it was either him or another candidate </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really matter that they </v>

38
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 1>described as bolshy and an outspoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolshie meaning Bolshevik,</v>

39
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:50.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

40
00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:50.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>he's appropriately Bolshie.</v>

42
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no different than saying,</v>

43
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's appropriately not see.</v>

44
00:01:55.631 --> 00:01:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what the hell is that?</v>

45
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were 50 million people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were killed in the Soviet Union by the </v>

46
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.360
<v Speaker 1>bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's and maybe twice that many in,</v>

47
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.720
<v Speaker 1>in China that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that says nothing about Cambodia and all</v>

48
00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:10.720
<v Speaker 1>the other places there were radical left</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood bass.</v>

49
00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>You think it's cute to call someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolshie Jesus appalling.</v>

50
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.540
<v Speaker 1>It's appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not some fashionable thing that you</v>

51
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:23.541
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's participation in some of the </v>

52
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:26.361
<v Speaker 1>deepest intellectual morasses of evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>that human beings have ever managed to </v>

53
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet it's fashionable.</v>

54
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>It shows you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the universities are worth.</v>

55
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the downside of Stella.</v>

56
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stella,</v>

57
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.450
<v Speaker 1>in his hangman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of cartoon would've gotten you</v>

58
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:42.451
<v Speaker 1>killed in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are Stellan as st himself in a </v>

59
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:46.221
<v Speaker 1>stained glass representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a statue of Stella and covered </v>

60
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:50.290
<v Speaker 1>with red paint for the blood after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wall came down there Stellan as what?</v>

61
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>It's very much like Medina's Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>You look at that and it's exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

63
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Marketable idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the Americans going.</v>

64
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.940
<v Speaker 1>It had a cap in hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a little large.</v>

65
00:02:59.941 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From Papa Stellan.</v>

66
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a painting of the Communists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forcibly collectivizing,</v>

67
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>the productive farmers in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union in the early 19 twenties.</v>

68
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:14.220
<v Speaker 1>The kulaks right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything from whom they stole and rape</v>

69
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>them and murdered them and ship them off</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Siberia and killed them and wiped out</v>

70
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:23.371
<v Speaker 1>the productive farmers of the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union and then starved 6 million </v>

71
00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:27.691
<v Speaker 1>Ukrainians to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is some poor kid in the 19 </v>

72
00:03:27.691 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>thirties who's ribs are showing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.790

<v Speaker 1>wide.</v>

74
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:35.791
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the fortunate ones because </v>

75
00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:35.791
<v Speaker 1>he's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like bull sheet.</v>

76
00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
