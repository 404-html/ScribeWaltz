1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I tell you the Zebra story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>any of you know that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.130
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell it.</v>

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Stop me if I've told it to you before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This tells you everything you need to </v>

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>know about human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's worth it.</v>

6
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>It's worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth knowing.</v>

7
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so zebras have stripes and people say,</v>

8
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for camouflage,</v>

9
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>and then you think about that for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds and you think that's a really </v>

10
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>stupid theory because lions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>camouflaged and they're like golden,</v>

11
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>like the grass and zebras are black and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>

12
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:30.710
<v Speaker 1>so you can see a zebra five miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a zebra,</v>

13
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:35.711
<v Speaker 1>it's black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the whole camouflage thing that's </v>

14
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 1>just not working out so well as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>

15
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bylaw biologists go and they decided </v>

16
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.121
<v Speaker 1>to take a look at some zebras and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking at zebra at on the herd </v>

17
00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>because there's no zebra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Just like there's no fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are schools of fish and there are </v>

19
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>herds of zebras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a fish.</v>

20
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>This is why I think the cod aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming back.</v>

21
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.510
<v Speaker 1>There are no cod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are massive hundred mile long </v>

22
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>schools of cod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 stories deep,</v>

23
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>20 million years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wipe out the school.</v>

24
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't just get to throw a quad in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the water and say,</v>

25
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>off you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

27
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's my city?</v>

28
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like launching you in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a field.</v>

29
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 1>go out there and reproduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

31
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not gonna happen,</v>

32
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:22.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so without the school that there's no </v>

33
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:24.951
<v Speaker 1>cod and you can't just introduce a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>school of cod because you don't have a </v>

34
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:25.040
<v Speaker 1>whole school of cod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

35
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe the cod are never coming back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>zebras are the same thing there.</v>

36
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.200
<v Speaker 1>There's not a zebra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's zebras and so you're looking at </v>

37
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.491
<v Speaker 1>the zebras trying to study as zebra and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the Zebra and you make some </v>

38
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>notes and you look up and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Christ.</v>

39
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Which zebra was I looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is you don't know</v>

40
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camouflage is against the herd and </v>

41
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.910
<v Speaker 1>the black and white stripes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a variety of reasons for this.</v>

42
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Stripes flies also seem not to like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stripes,</v>

43
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually people,</v>

44
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>things evolve for multiple reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

45
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to parse out a zebra</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the herd.</v>

46
00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>You look down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look up,</v>

47
00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

48
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll hold those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn zebras look the same.</v>

49
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camouflage is effective,</v>

50
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:04.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's against the herd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

51
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

52
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>we better identify as zebra so we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see what he's up to.</v>

53
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>So then you take your jeep and a can of </v>
<v Speaker 1>red paint and a stick with a rag on the </v>

54
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.260
<v Speaker 1>end of it and you drive up to the zebras</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you paint their haunch.</v>

55
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:21.261
<v Speaker 1>Read that a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a nice red dot on their haunch or </v>

56
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:23.601
<v Speaker 1>maybe clipped the rear with a cattle </v>
<v Speaker 1>clip and then you stand back and you </v>

57
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:23.601
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

58
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty smart now.</v>

59
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.700
<v Speaker 1>I gotta watch that Zebra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think happens to the </v>

60
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Zebra?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lions kill it,</v>

61
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

62
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because lions,</v>

63
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>they're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

64
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Hunter hunting animals are smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have to identify a zebra before</v>

65
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 1>they can organize their hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't just hunt the whole herd.</v>

66
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.140
<v Speaker 1>They have to pick out a zebra and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's like a zebra that's got a </v>

67
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.050
<v Speaker 1>sore hip or something and so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>nature's kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just takes the week.</v>

69
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:54.570
<v Speaker 1>It's still no zebra or lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really healthy,</v>

70
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:59.571
<v Speaker 1>delicious zebras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they look like all the other </v>

71
00:02:59.571 --> 00:03:02.001
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious zebras so they can't get a </v>

72
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:04.171
<v Speaker 1>beat on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if there are small and just born or </v>

73
00:03:04.171 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>if they're limping or there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that identifies them,</v>

74
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>then the lions can pick them out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they do pick them out.</v>

75
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.070
<v Speaker 1>And so the rule for human beings is keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>your damn stripes on so the lions don't </v>

76
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>get you.</v>

77
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

78
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>if you want to remember one thing from </v>
<v Speaker 1>my class about human motivation,</v>

79
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People camouflage themselves against the</v>

80
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>herd and they like to be in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the herd,</v>

81
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>which is what fish do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

82
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>if you have a big school of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smart,</v>

83
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.880
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large fish are in the middle of the </v>

84
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>school because you know what you call a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish on the outside of the school bait,</v>

85
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what people are doing there </v>

86
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 1>are trying to move into the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the herd all the time and the herd moves</v>

87
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 1>around or the school moves around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going,</v>

88
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the middle,</v>

89
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:52.651
<v Speaker 1>I'm staying in the middle here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've got this protective ring of </v>

90
00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>people around me so the predators don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick me out and do me in.</v>

91
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's part of the reason why I said,</v>

92
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:04.321
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't sell something to someone for </v>

93
00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:04.321
<v Speaker 1>success because you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

94
00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>people are aiming at success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

95
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:10.561
<v Speaker 1>don't be thinking that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not by any means necessarily true </v>

96
00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism is a potential most powerful</v>

97
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:17.971
<v Speaker 1>motivator and trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism is let's not be too </v>

98
00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:17.971
<v Speaker 1>threatened or hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

99
00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:22.711
<v Speaker 1>That's the negative emotion system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the negative emotion system is a </v>

100
00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:23.190
<v Speaker 1>killer source of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

101
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>you also see that there are scales of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing that have been designed mostly</v>

102
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 1>by social psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they're very bad scales most</v>

103
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 1>of the time because their psychometric </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity is is is absurdly low,</v>

104
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:39.121
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you find with scales of </v>

105
00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:42.061
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing sometimes they're talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>as scales of happiness even is that </v>

106
00:04:42.061 --> 00:04:43.050
<v Speaker 1>people aren't after happiness </v>
<v Speaker 1>thereafter,</v>

107
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>not hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so they don't want to be </v>

108
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.271
<v Speaker 1>extroverted and enthusiastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and and bubbly and full of smiles </v>

109
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>and laughter.</v>

110
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what they mean by I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be happy.</v>

111
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 1>What they mean is I don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious or in pain,</v>

112
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.430
<v Speaker 1>and so wellbeing scales tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like neuroticism,</v>

113
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability plus extroversion,</v>

114
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>but the big loading is on emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability.</v>

115
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 1>The reverse of neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to avoid suffering.</v>

116
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to avoid suffering,</v>

117
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>and one way to avoid suffering is not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the Lions Gnaw on you.</v>

118
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.800
<v Speaker 1>And one way of doing that is to stay in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the damn hurt.</v>

119
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 1>And so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being a smart Alec about this.</v>

120
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I understand why people do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's real danger to being visible.</v>

121
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:29.290
<v Speaker 1>There's real danger in being visible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

122
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 1>You might be successful if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>visible,</v>

123
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 1>but you also might be dead.</v>
