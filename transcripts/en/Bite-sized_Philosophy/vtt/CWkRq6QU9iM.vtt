00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Any more pages and stuff coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

3
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Think with psm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I was saying this to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to his wife.</v>

5
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you're making music and </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing and stuff,</v>

6
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes you quote the greats and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

7
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>you quote a hunter s Thompson or you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>a young or whatever,</v>

8
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.980
<v Speaker 1>but they're all dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:19.360
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were already.</v>

10
00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Or if there are audio recordings of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

11
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>they're not very good and there aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>that many of them.</v>

12
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.910
<v Speaker 1>And here we have peterson like spitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking napalm on a daily basis,</v>

13
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>like dropping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laying in hours of audio everyday.</v>

14
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>It's all fucking brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all incredibly valuable.</v>

15
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:40.281
<v Speaker 1>And it's also incredibly sonorous </v>
<v Speaker 1>musical and beautiful and important and </v>

16
00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>necessary right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I did nothing else in my life,</v>

17
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>even if I didn't even eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could just sit there making peterson </v>

18
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>music forever because there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

19
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I will continue to make Peterson stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it will continue to be useful when </v>

21
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>there's also many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other things to draw into music and</v>

22
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>make useful in that fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically,</v>

23
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:06.141
<v Speaker 1>it appears to be a new genre or at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new way of sort of communicating ideas</v>

24
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 1>and stuff and I've always done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always made mixed tapes that bought</v>

25
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>in people talking and bringing in ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and meeting musical.</v>

26
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Just like now there's a real big </v>
<v Speaker 1>appetite for it and thanks to those </v>

27
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.400
<v Speaker 1>lovely robots over at Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an expanding universe of,</v>

28
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>of a potential for people actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to listen to it and being able </v>

29
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.811
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there will be a jd and low fi </v>

30
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:32.811
<v Speaker 1>genre?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 1>there is no other people are doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

32
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>If you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go look it up,</v>

33
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
<v Speaker 1>there's actually loads of people doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it now to like varying degrees of </v>

34
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But lots of people are doing it and I've</v>

35
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>been doing it with other things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

36
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.280
<v Speaker 1>it's called meaning wave now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Speaker 1>someone called it that in a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a genre.</v>

38
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>It's now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

39
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 1>it's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called meeting wave.</v>

40
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it combines music,</v>

41
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>aesthetics of low fire and vapor wave </v>
<v Speaker 1>and vapor trap and,</v>

42
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>and cloud rap and with meaningful spoken</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

43
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.790
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just peterson?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

44
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>it's now just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda like the intellectual dark </v>

45
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>web thing I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with music,</v>

46
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle for power size each other up </v>

47
00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:28.081
<v Speaker 2>and elect the competent and they do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>at every level of society.</v>

48
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.700
<v Speaker 2>Side rail crew in southern Saskatchewan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rough guys,</v>

49
00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:41.701
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of them have been in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when you first came onto the </v>

50
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:45.821
<v Speaker 2>rail crew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a stupid nickname and people </v>

51
00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:48.410
<v Speaker 2>tease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I remember this one kid called </v>

52
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.940
<v Speaker 2>lunchbox because he came to the rail </v>
<v Speaker 2>crew with a lunch bucket that looked </v>

53
00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:57.530
<v Speaker 2>like his moment packed in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a bad idea.</v>

54
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 2>So they him lunch buckets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she wasn't very happy about.</v>

55
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.390
<v Speaker 2>That was a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He should have taken it with a smile and</v>

56
00:03:05.391 --> 00:03:09.620
<v Speaker 2>then he was always to bowman if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked him to do something even wide,</v>

57
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.000
<v Speaker 3>why</v>

58
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 2>it's about 60 men on this stretched on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trucks.</v>

59
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.490
<v Speaker 2>Soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anonymous philosophers were throwing </v>

60
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.470
<v Speaker 2>pebbles out during her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on and so the gateway,</v>

61
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 2>let's see if we can get that lunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucket.</v>

62
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 2>And that was purposeful because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

63
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't take a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

64
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see if he could take this job,</v>

65
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.220
<v Speaker 2>and then it just got more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>peevish and the pebbles got bigger and </v>

66
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.641
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learned anything from experience,</v>

67
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.820
<v Speaker 2>but you come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you take a job,</v>

68
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.800
<v Speaker 2>can you be useful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you at least be amusing?</v>

69
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Is there something worthwhile?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

70
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

71
00:04:13.681 --> 00:04:18.681
<v Speaker 2>well then you're rounding because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>never know when we actually might need </v>

72
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:22.070
<v Speaker 2>to depend on you.</v>
