1
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.830
<v Speaker 1>One thing that I'd been doing in my tour</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly when I talk about the first </v>

2
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:11.301
<v Speaker 1>chapter of my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is stand up straight with your </v>

3
00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:13.581
<v Speaker 1>shoulders back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a discussion of hierarchies and </v>

4
00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:13.581
<v Speaker 1>their eternal nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5
00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Because my claim is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not my claim,</v>

6
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:19.731
<v Speaker 1>I think it's mirror fact that organisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have to cooperate and compete with </v>

7
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:27.741
<v Speaker 1>other organisms have their type </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitably arranged themselves into </v>

8
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies and that's been going on for</v>
<v Speaker 1>so long,</v>

9
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.900
<v Speaker 1>which is at least 300 million years that</v>
<v Speaker 1>our nervous systems have adapted to </v>

11
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:40.971
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies as if they're a permanent </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of being right,</v>

12
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.430
<v Speaker 1>more permanent than trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like seriously permanent at the most </v>

13
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>fundamental neurochemical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that regulates the entire brain.</v>

14
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin is acutely sensitive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical distinctions.</v>

15
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.120
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I laid that proposition </v>

16
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.781
<v Speaker 1>forward was to say whatever pitfalls </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies might produce,</v>

17
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.870
<v Speaker 1>you cannot lay them at the feet of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>West Patriarchy or capitalism.</v>

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a nonstarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wrong and not just a little bit </v>

19
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.261
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so seriously wrong that if you </v>

20
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:20.811
<v Speaker 1>insist upon doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't even achieve your own aims </v>

21
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>because you're actually not grappling </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the problem.</v>

22
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>The problem is if hierarchies are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

23
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>which they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is way more serious than </v>

24
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.920
<v Speaker 1>mere capitalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way deeper and if you're actually </v>

25
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.240
<v Speaker 1>interested in rectifying the constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative consequences of </v>

26
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:43.311
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have to get a lot </v>

27
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>more sophisticated than their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than your idiot Marxism.</v>

28
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

29
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>so part of the elaboration of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument is,</v>

30
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:52.911
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies are inevitable because we </v>

31
00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>have to solve complex problems and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to solve them socially.</v>

32
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 1>And when you implement a solution to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex problem,</v>

33
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:02.391
<v Speaker 1>socially you produce a hierarchy because</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people are better at the </v>

34
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>implementation than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a hierarchy of competence and</v>

35
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>then there's a hierarchy of distribution</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the spoils.</v>

36
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in both of those hierarchies,</v>

37
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:15.501
<v Speaker 1>you get a disproportionate clumping of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources at the top and dispossession </v>

38
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>at the bottle and the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>

39
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.030
<v Speaker 1>So what's the left for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The left is to remind those who are </v>

40
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:28.521
<v Speaker 1>benefiting from the hierarchies that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy comes at a cost and the cost </v>

41
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:35.061
<v Speaker 1>is the clumping of people at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that's an eternal cost and it's</v>

42
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:40.401
<v Speaker 1>not trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what the left should be </v>

43
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:43.881
<v Speaker 1>properly focused on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The left should be providing the voice </v>

44
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:47.661
<v Speaker 1>of those who are dispossessed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies and the right should be </v>

45
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:47.661
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

46
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>but the damn hierarchies are necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not only necessary,</v>

47
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>but there are also productive than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left says yes,</v>

48
00:02:57.091 --> 00:03:02.091
<v Speaker 1>but they tilt towards tyranny and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be occupied inappropriately by </v>

49
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:07.681
<v Speaker 1>people who are playing games of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough to write has to take that </v>

50
00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>into account.</v>

51
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.010
<v Speaker 1>The hierarchy can rigidity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigidity,</v>

52
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.480
<v Speaker 1>and is likely to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can be taken over by people who </v>

53
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>are corrupt and that's likely to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

54
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's okay because the dialogue could</v>

55
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>work out the right can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

56
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:27.001
<v Speaker 1>we need the damn hierarchies and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be buttressed and the left can </v>

57
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:30.091
<v Speaker 1>say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have to be maintained property </v>

58
00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>so they don't deteriorate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerate.</v>

59
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's,</v>

60
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I think that's ancient wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the ancient Egyptians had </v>

61
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 1>figured that out in their symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations.</v>

62
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.460
<v Speaker 1>So now when the left goes too far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does something like say,</v>

63
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about no hierarchy?</v>

64
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

65
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:51.991
<v Speaker 1>how about not wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because all that happens if you fly.</v>

66
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.240
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happens if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>flatten out the hierarchy is that you </v>

67
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.240
<v Speaker 1>can't even organize your perceptions.</v>

68
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>You can't perceive the world without </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world through a hierarchy</v>

69
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:06.571
<v Speaker 1>of value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if because you can't perceive the </v>

70
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:09.841
<v Speaker 1>world unless you make one thing more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important than all the other things </v>

71
00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:09.841
<v Speaker 1>because you don't even know what to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

72
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>and if one thing isn't more important </v>
<v Speaker 1>than all the other things,</v>

73
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>then you have nothing to aim at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have nothing to aim at,</v>

74
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:19.741
<v Speaker 1>then you have no meaning in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the left can't just demolish the </v>

75
00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies in the name of some equality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of outcome,</v>

76
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you blow out the future,</v>

77
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:29.401
<v Speaker 1>you leave people aimless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you destroyed the very institutions </v>

78
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 1>that allow people to make competent </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress in the world.</v>

79
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>That's not an acceptable outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have to,</v>

80
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.720
<v Speaker 1>we have to agree to live with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tension necessity for hierarchies that </v>

81
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:46.431
<v Speaker 1>proclivity for them to pathologize and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the necessary voice of the left and </v>

82
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 1>speaking for the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the dispossessed.</v>
