1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Obsessive compulsive disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so chronic handwashing for example,</v>

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>is this is as an anxiety disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is an anxiety component to it,</v>

3
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe that that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate classification.</v>

4
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:15.981
<v Speaker 1>I think that obsessive compulsive </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder is actually a disorder of </v>

5
00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:18.801
<v Speaker 1>disgust because all of the behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including hyper grooming people </v>

6
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.941
<v Speaker 1>sometimes have trichotillomania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll pull out the hairs on their </v>

7
00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:26.181
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grooming behaviors and that sort of </v>

8
00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:28.281
<v Speaker 1>thing seemed to be more associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the operation of the disgust system and </v>

9
00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:31.971
<v Speaker 1>almost everything about obsessive </v>
<v Speaker 1>compulsive disorder has a disgust basis.</v>

10
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:37.071
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are who have ocd obsessive about is that</v>

11
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>I've got a client once who was this poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

12
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:44.751
<v Speaker 1>By the time her ocd was done with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She built the equivalent of an airlock </v>

13
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:49.101
<v Speaker 1>on her house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like not technically proficient or </v>

14
00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:51.411
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And her husband and her children had to </v>

15
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>go through an elaborate decontamination </v>
<v Speaker 1>process before they were allowed to step</v>

16
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>foot in the house.</v>

17
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things she was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned about was that she would go </v>

18
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>out to a supermarket and touch a piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of fruit.</v>

19
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and become contaminated and then come </v>

20
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.991
<v Speaker 1>home and touch her children and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would become contaminated and so </v>

21
00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:09.590
<v Speaker 1>while she ended up in the hospital and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was divorced and I just did it in </v>

22
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.700
<v Speaker 1>her life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>and so then people who have obsessive </v>
<v Speaker 1>compulsive disorder,</v>

24
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

25
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>they'll wash their hands until the soap </v>
<v Speaker 1>is gone,</v>

26
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>like a whole bar of soap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

27
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:22.131
<v Speaker 1>And you can often tell who they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>because their hands are shiny from </v>

28
00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Washington much and they'll shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't get out of the shower,</v>

29
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:26.330
<v Speaker 1>they'll shower until the hot water is </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely gone and you know,</v>

30
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>so the self cleaning mechanism so to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>

31
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:34.431
<v Speaker 1>have gone seriously astray and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you treat them as by exposing them to </v>

32
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>things that are disgusting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminating.</v>

33
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I had a client with ocd once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was quite the character and I.</v>

34
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I had him do was we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would look for things on the Internet,</v>

35
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 1>pictures of things that really disgusted</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

36
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not that much fun by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treating someone who has ocd because I'm</v>

37
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>rather disgust sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was also rather hard on me,</v>

38
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would look for things on the Internet</v>

39
00:01:57.421 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he really didn't like.</v>

40
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>And then I'd print them out and have him</v>
<v Speaker 1>put him on his fridge,</v>

41
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>which he did not like at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would,</v>

42
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a bunch of other problems and we </v>

43
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.931
<v Speaker 1>got along quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for a long time I treated him for </v>

44
00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:14.901
<v Speaker 1>about three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would phone me like three or four </v>

45
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>times a day because he had obsessive </v>
<v Speaker 1>compulsive disorder and just swear at me</v>

46
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.770
<v Speaker 1>just swear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

48
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>get these messages.</v>

49
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>He'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

50
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.490
<v Speaker 1>he phoned me and he was just so mad at </v>
<v Speaker 1>me because I'd have to put these things </v>

51
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.490
<v Speaker 1>on his fridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

52
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>And so he'd curse and swear and yell at </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

53
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>And then two minutes later he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone and apologize and say he was </v>

54
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>really sorry and helped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would continue to see them.</v>

55
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.040
<v Speaker 1>And God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just went.</v>

56
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I just went on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I felt sorry for the poor guy.</v>

57
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he eventually ended up getting a puppy.</v>

58
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.960
<v Speaker 1>You agreeable people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

59
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.640
<v Speaker 1>puppy God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

60
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:47.590
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

61
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

62
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.460
<v Speaker 1>that was good for him because he had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go around and clean up after the PA,</v>

63
00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>PA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that had poor puppy.</v>

64
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>It was quite dominant and had all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that happened to that poor guy so</v>

65
00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>the puppy would dominate him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he'd take it outside to take it for a</v>

66
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>walk and he wasn't a very skilled person</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many,</v>

67
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 1>many ways.</v>

68
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>He had a very large number of severe </v>
<v Speaker 1>impediments and so,</v>

69
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.450
<v Speaker 1>but he really liked this pop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have any friends or anything </v>

70
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.890
<v Speaker 1>like that and he was supported by his </v>
<v Speaker 1>aged mother and God.</v>

71
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.900
<v Speaker 1>It was just a catastrophe and he'd go </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside and try to walk the puppy and </v>

72
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>the puppy would just sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

73
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:28.411
<v Speaker 1>because it was doing dominant stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know how to overcome it and </v>

74
00:03:28.411 --> 00:03:31.740
<v Speaker 1>then these crazy people from across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way who styled themselves as animal </v>

75
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.611
<v Speaker 1>rights activists started to harass me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they phoned up his mother and told </v>

76
00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:35.611
<v Speaker 1>them that if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

77
00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>if she didn't take the dog away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that retard,</v>

78
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:42.691
<v Speaker 1>they were going to come over and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible things to him and then he got </v>

79
00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:46.141
<v Speaker 1>harassed on the street and then he went </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a park with his dog and they came up </v>

80
00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>to him and pushed him on the card and </v>
<v Speaker 1>swiped his dog and ran off to the,</v>

81
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.420
<v Speaker 1>to the SPCA and dumped it there and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to move away from his apartment and </v>

82
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

83
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>it was just an absolute catastrophe.</v>

84
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>They had plenty of sympathy for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn dog,</v>

85
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 1>but no sympathy whatsoever for the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

86
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really something.</v>

87
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that story ended happily.</v>

88
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Weirdly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got a.</v>

89
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.890
<v Speaker 1>He got a job with a woman who used to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychiatric nurse who was training </v>

90
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.480
<v Speaker 1>dogs and she gave him a little job </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting up the dog training thing and </v>

91
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.371
<v Speaker 1>then he got to learn to train his dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost like he was a thin guy to begin </v>

92
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:26.851
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost like 30 pounds trying to learn </v>

93
00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:26.851
<v Speaker 1>how to take care of this puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just.</v>

94
00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was gonna die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is no way he was going to give</v>

95
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 1>up that dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>

96
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>OCD,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite the bloody catastrophe.</v>

97
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.530
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a good thing for someone who </v>

98
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.530
<v Speaker 1>has ocd to have a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

99
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Because dogs are messy and so there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things that are messy about</v>

100
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:48.031
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to kind of live with the </v>

101
00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:48.031
<v Speaker 1>mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to live with the mass.</v>

102
00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:51.301
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to have a child or if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a partner of any </v>

103
00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:51.301
<v Speaker 1>sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:54.701
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't let the orderliness part of </v>

105
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:56.650
<v Speaker 1>you get the upper hand so terribly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible for you to lift.</v>
