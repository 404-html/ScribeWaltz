1
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Ask and it shall be given you seek and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you shall find knock and it shall be </v>

2
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.990
<v Speaker 1>opened unto you for everyone that asks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>receives and he that seeketh findeth and</v>

3
00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:13.550
<v Speaker 1>to him that knocks it shall be opened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounded pretty optimistic again,</v>

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.950
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

5
00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a description of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of existential reality and and</v>

6
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.830
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by which I mean</v>

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>when I'm in my clinical practice and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>observe and this is also the case with </v>

8
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.291
<v Speaker 1>my students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is let's say people's lives aren't what </v>

9
00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>they would like them to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you ask why?</v>

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about tragedy and catastrophe </v>

11
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>because that's self evident and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to discuss that.</v>

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Although the degree to which you bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your own tragedy is always </v>

13
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.160
<v Speaker 1>indeterminant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would never say that every </v>

14
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing that is visited on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person is something they deserved.</v>

15
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's a very dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition,</v>

16
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.240
<v Speaker 1>especially because everyone gets sick </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone dies,</v>

17
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 1>but one of the main reasons that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get what they want is because they</v>

18
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:13.261
<v Speaker 1>don't actually figure out what it is and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to </v>

19
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would be good for you,</v>

20
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would even be better than what you</v>

21
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:22.311
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be wrong about what you want </v>

23
00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you could get.</v>

24
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>What would really be good for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 1>why don't you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>because you don't try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think,</v>

27
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

28
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>here's what I would like if I could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and I don't mean I don't mean in a </v>

29
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.571
<v Speaker 1>way that you manipulate the world to </v>
<v Speaker 1>force it to deliver you good for status </v>

30
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:44.350
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what I mean.</v>

31
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean something like imagine that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were taking care of yourself like you </v>

32
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 1>were someone you actually cared for and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you thought,</v>

33
00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:53.170
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am caring for this person.</v>

34
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I would like things to go as well for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as possible.</v>

35
00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>What would their life have to be like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order for that to be the case where </v>

36
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.830
<v Speaker 1>people don't do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't sit down and think,</v>

37
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:03.400
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know?</v>

38
00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's figure it out.</v>

39
00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a life.</v>

40
00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:06.940
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

41
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like three years from now you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have what you need.</v>

42
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.340
<v Speaker 1>You got to be careful about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have everything you can have,</v>

43
00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:20.341
<v Speaker 1>what would be good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to figure out what it is </v>

44
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:20.341
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to aim at it.</v>

45
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my experience with people is been as if </v>

46
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 1>they figure out what it is that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for them and then they aim at it.</v>

47
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Then they get it and it's strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't ness.</v>

48
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite that simple because you </v>

49
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.601
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may formulate an idea about what </v>

50
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:41.411
<v Speaker 1>would be good for you and then you take </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 steps towards that and you find out </v>

51
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:42.980
<v Speaker 1>that your formulation was a bit off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to reformulate your goal.</v>

52
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.030
<v Speaker 1>So you're kind of going like this as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>move towards the goal.</v>

53
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.360
<v Speaker 1>But a huge part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people fail is because they don't ever </v>

54
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.500
<v Speaker 1>set up the criteria for success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so since success is a very narrow </v>

55
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.121
<v Speaker 1>line and very unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to </v>

56
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.611
<v Speaker 1>stumble it randomly is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if there's a proposition here in </v>

57
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>the proposition is if you actually want </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

58
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>you can have it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question then would be,</v>

59
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by actually want?</v>

60
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is that you reorient your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life in every possible way to make the </v>

61
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>probability that that will occur as </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain as possible.</v>

62
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's a sacrificial idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

63
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't get everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you obviously,</v>

64
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.640
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you can have what you need and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe all you have to do to get it is </v>

65
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.980
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but asking isn't a whim or,</v>

66
00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:47.981
<v Speaker 1>or today's wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to be deadly serious </v>

67
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to think,</v>

68
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:53.251
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking stock of myself and if I was </v>

69
00:03:53.251 --> 00:03:56.941
<v Speaker 1>going to live properly in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to set myself up such that </v>

70
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>being would justify itself in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimation.</v>

71
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean as a harsh judge </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what is it that I would aim at?</v>

72
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've found is that in </v>

73
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>test of this theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you could try this.</v>

74
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.610
<v Speaker 1>This is a form of prayer knocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sit on your bed one day and ask </v>

75
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.261
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's what remarkably stupid things am </v>

76
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>I doing on a regular basis to absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>screw up my life,</v>

77
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>and if you actually asked that question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to want to know the answer,</v>

78
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:38.491
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's actually what asking the </v>

79
00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:38.491
<v Speaker 1>question means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean just mouthing the words.</v>

80
00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:40.510
<v Speaker 1>It means you have to decide that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to know.</v>

81
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 1>You'll figure that out so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll make your hair curl,</v>

82
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>you'll you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as if young thought about this,</v>

83
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:53.671
<v Speaker 1>he saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought that people had two poles of </v>

84
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:56.011
<v Speaker 1>consciousness in one was the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that we each identify </v>

85
00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:59.761
<v Speaker 1>within.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other was something he called the </v>

86
00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:01.261
<v Speaker 1>self and the self is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think about it as the divine </v>

87
00:05:01.261 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 1>within.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's close enough approximation.</v>

88
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 1>It's the universal part of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

89
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>It's your conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

90
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Whatever your conscience is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that you can consult.</v>

91
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:16.771
<v Speaker 1>It's like the socratic daymond socrates </v>
<v Speaker 1>said that the thing that made him </v>

92
00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 1>different than everyone else in Greece </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that he consulted his demon,</v>

93
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:25.111
<v Speaker 1>his genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He asked himself how it was that he </v>

94
00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>should conduct himself in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he did that,</v>

95
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't try to force a solution.</v>

96
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't try to force a solution.</v>

97
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Selfishly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he asked,</v>

98
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to manifest myself in the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible manner in the world.</v>

99
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:40.240
<v Speaker 1>I would like to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would that be?</v>

100
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 1>While you're perfectly capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

101
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.440
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how you're perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of immense feats of imagination </v>

102
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.020
<v Speaker 1>and dreams and fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how you do all of that.</v>

103
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.470
<v Speaker 1>What would happen if you consulted </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself about the best possible outcome</v>

104
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:58.930
<v Speaker 1>for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might get an answer.</v>

105
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what this proposition is.</v>
