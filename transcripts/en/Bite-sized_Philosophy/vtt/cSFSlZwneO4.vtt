1
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.290
<v Speaker 1>If you concentrate solely on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.830
<v Speaker 1>you can get along way in your career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that that's a strategy </v>

3
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>that a minority of men preferentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.310
<v Speaker 1>that that's all they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They worked like 70,</v>

5
00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Speaker 1>80 hours a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd go flat out on their career.</v>

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 1>They're staking everything on the small </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of exceptional status in a </v>

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.120
<v Speaker 1>narrow domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

8
00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>It's hard on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a life.</v>

9
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult for them to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

10
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how to take any leisure </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity like they get very one </v>

11
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.021
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it may be that that unit </v>

12
00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:36.260
<v Speaker 1>dimensionality is the price you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay to be exceptional at one thing,</v>

13
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're going to be something </v>

14
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 1>like a genius level mathematician and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do that for,</v>

15
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.750
<v Speaker 1>or a scientists say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're in your lab,</v>

16
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>you're in your lab all the time.</v>

17
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.560
<v Speaker 1>You're working 70 hours a week or 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a week,</v>

18
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.390
<v Speaker 1>you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dedicated,</v>

19
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:55.391
<v Speaker 1>you're unit dimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how you get to beat all the </v>

20
00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:56.360
<v Speaker 1>other people who are doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only way,</v>

21
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is you don't get a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

22
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:04.001
<v Speaker 1>if you love being a scientist and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that kind of focus of mind,</v>

23
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.550
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a rare person and second you're </v>

24
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.550
<v Speaker 1>going to pay for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fine.</v>

25
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.160
<v Speaker 1>More power to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

26
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a risky business to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sacrifice a lot for it.</v>

28
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say most often if you're </v>

29
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.960
<v Speaker 1>speaking about having a healthy life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what you do.</v>

30
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.360
<v Speaker 1>You spread yourself out more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

31
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:29.240
<v Speaker 1>you have a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have some things that you do outside</v>

32
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>of work that are meaningful to you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

33
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.860
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a network of friends,</v>

34
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

35
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.620
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those three things,</v>

36
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:38.630
<v Speaker 1>a loaner for things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a loner,</v>

37
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.930
<v Speaker 1>plenty to keep you well oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if one of those things </v>

38
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.930
<v Speaker 1>collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.080
<v Speaker 1>everything doesn't go now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The price you pay for that is,</v>

40
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>the more you strive to optimize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance,</v>

41
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.260
<v Speaker 1>the less likely you are to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastically successful at any single </v>

42
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.780
<v Speaker 1>one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you might have a very,</v>

43
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you consider your life as a whole,</v>

44
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>that might be a winning strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things,</v>

45
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad,</v>

46
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.130
<v Speaker 1>I really liked this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought that men went after </v>

47
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>perfection and when women went after </v>
<v Speaker 1>wholeness,</v>

48
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>so there are different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are different value there.</v>

49
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>They're different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something different at the top </v>

50
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.590
<v Speaker 1>of the value hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So perfection would be steak,</v>

51
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:24.200
<v Speaker 1>it all in one thing and look for radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

52
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Not all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that all men do that because they </v>

53
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.001
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're talking about extremes at </v>

54
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:31.190
<v Speaker 1>least with regards to the men that do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

55
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.320
<v Speaker 1>The wholeness ideas more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want.</v>

57
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like I want one thing in my life to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be 150 percent or I want five things in </v>

58
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>my life to be 80 percent.</v>

59
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Well there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more richness in a life </v>

60
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.080
<v Speaker 1>where you have five things operating at </v>
<v Speaker 1>80 percent,</v>

61
00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:53.470
<v Speaker 1>but you're not operating in any at any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them at 150 percent.</v>

62
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really believe this because I've </v>

63
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.201
<v Speaker 1>watched men and women go through their </v>
<v Speaker 1>careers now for a long period time and </v>

64
00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that produce this,</v>

65
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.960
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that I've noticed </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that mostly women in their thirties </v>

66
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>bear bail out of unidimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional careers.</v>

67
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>They won't do them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't.</v>

68
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.390
<v Speaker 1>They won't put it in the 80 hours a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would have to put in in order </v>

69
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>to dominate that particular area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't.</v>

70
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.920
<v Speaker 1>The reason that they won't do it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they decide it's not worth it </v>

71
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder because why would that be </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth it?</v>

72
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>You have to ask yourself that.</v>

73
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

74
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>you want to be an outstanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>

75
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

76
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

77
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:39.781
<v Speaker 1>that's what you want because that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do because you're </v>

78
00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>competing with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 1>they're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hardworking,</v>

80
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:47.491
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to be at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be smarter and work harder </v>

81
00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:50.821
<v Speaker 1>than any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And working hard means working long </v>

82
00:03:50.821 --> 00:03:50.821
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

83
00:03:50.821 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>it also means working diligently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in in the final analysis,</v>

84
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:58.561
<v Speaker 1>it's also an additive issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm smart and hard working and I can </v>

85
00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 1>crank out for 70 hours a week and you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it for 30,</v>

86
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like in two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so far ahead of you.</v>

87
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>You will never ever catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>

88
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.500
<v Speaker 1>And I think partly maybe part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason too that women are oriented that </v>

89
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.711
<v Speaker 1>way more than men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's two reasons is one is </v>

90
00:04:16.711 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic status does not make women</v>
<v Speaker 1>more attractive on the mating market,</v>

91
00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 1>but it does make men more attractive.</v>

92
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>And the second is women's timeframe is </v>
<v Speaker 1>compressed,</v>

93
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because guys can always say,</v>

94
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>well I'll have kids later and they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that until they're like 80.</v>

95
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Whereas women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

96
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>no way man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta get you gotta get it together.</v>

97
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:32.410
<v Speaker 1>By the time you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say 40,</v>

98
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:37.411
<v Speaker 1>but really probably by 35,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but definitely by 40 because otherwise </v>

99
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>it ain't happening and that's bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreadful.</v>

100
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Like the most unhappy people you ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

101
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.130
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

102
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.970
<v Speaker 1>One of the common roots to extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappiness is to want children and not </v>

103
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Speaker 1>have the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend that.</v>

104
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see couples who were in their </v>

105
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.561
<v Speaker 1>thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one couple in three over the age of 30 </v>

106
00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:01.201
<v Speaker 1>has fertility problems that's defined as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an inability to conceive after one year </v>

107
00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:05.371
<v Speaker 1>of trying one in three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's worth thinking about because </v>

108
00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 1>people are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unhappy.</v>

109
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 1>If they want to have kids and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

110
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the medical mill for 10 years.</v>

111
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>If that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's what happens to you.</v>
