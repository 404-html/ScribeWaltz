1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>You've said that a marriage must be </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on trust and transparency and </v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.161
<v Speaker 1>being shackled together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How and for how long should you get to </v>

3
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:09.130
<v Speaker 1>know someone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does set a foundation?</v>

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

6
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.720
<v Speaker 1>there's no simple answer to that.</v>

7
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hello.</v>

8
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that you should know someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>well enough so that you can so that you </v>

9
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:35.121
<v Speaker 1>know if you can negotiate with them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you have started to formulate a </v>

10
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:40.311
<v Speaker 1>vision of your joint future that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>both look forward to with enthusiasm and</v>

11
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

12
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>and of course that's going to depend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree on your level of maturity,</v>

13
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.350
<v Speaker 1>but that means you've considered such </v>
<v Speaker 1>things as do you have a sufficient </v>

14
00:00:55.891 --> 00:01:00.891
<v Speaker 1>number of joint interests and are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented in the same direction with </v>

15
00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:04.521
<v Speaker 1>regards to how you're going to handle </v>
<v Speaker 1>your joint careers and the possibility </v>

16
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:08.421
<v Speaker 1>of children and that the manner in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to interact with your in </v>

17
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>laws and you have to start thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

18
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>You have to start</v>

19
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.470
<v Speaker 1>considering your life together from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of practicality and </v>

20
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

21
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't just be that massive erotic </v>

22
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>attraction that's associated with with </v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

23
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.980
<v Speaker 1>although I think that's extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>important and you're unbelievably </v>

24
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.680
<v Speaker 1>fortunate if you have that and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should do everything you can to maintain</v>

25
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which and that takes effort.</v>

26
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.510
<v Speaker 1>That takes real effort at will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need to ally that with with </v>

27
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>maturity and intelligence and maturity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and intelligence is okay,</v>

28
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put our lives together.</v>

29
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>What's that going to look like at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of detail?</v>

30
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to handle our finances?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are we going to live?</v>

31
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>What are our joint plans going to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's et cetera.</v>

32
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.740
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that my business </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners and I plan to do in,</v>

33
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.200
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say that in as an analog </v>

34
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.881
<v Speaker 1>to the self authoring suite is that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to develop an online program to </v>

35
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:12.111
<v Speaker 1>help people negotiate their </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships and and so it would </v>

36
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 1>actually provide an answer to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>question in a more comprehensive manner,</v>

37
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>is that imagine that if you want to set </v>
<v Speaker 1>up a household with someone,</v>

38
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.770
<v Speaker 1>then there's a lot of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to get straight and you either do </v>

39
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>that by bringing your unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions to bear on the situation and</v>

40
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:33.291
<v Speaker 1>perhaps clashing where they don't match </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you sit down like a conscious and </v>

41
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:39.381
<v Speaker 1>aware and articulate couple and start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate what your joint </v>

42
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities are going to be.</v>

43
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be well,</v>

44
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

45
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>who's responsible for the meals and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what are you going to eat and who's </v>

46
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.901
<v Speaker 1>going to get groceries and who's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay the bills and who's going to do </v>

47
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:53.320
<v Speaker 1>which part of what household chores </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are to do.</v>

48
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:55.480
<v Speaker 1>And how is that going to be laid out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair.</v>

49
00:02:55.481 --> 00:03:00.481
<v Speaker 1>And so you should get to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should get to know the person that </v>

50
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:05.581
<v Speaker 1>you're with well enough so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>start discussing the real practical </v>

51
00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:10.411
<v Speaker 1>issues of life and determine whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not you're capable of of negotiating </v>

52
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that necessarily means</v>

53
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>that you should live together because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence is actually quite strong.</v>

54
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 1>At least the last time I looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who live together are more rather</v>

55
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>than less likely to be divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that might be.</v>

56
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>That might have nothing to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual act of living together.</v>

57
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>It might be that people who are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to get divorced or also those who</v>

58
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:36.181
<v Speaker 1>are more likely to merely live together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that's a great </v>

59
00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>solution for reasons I won't get to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into now.</v>

60
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>And with regards to being shackled </v>
<v Speaker 1>together is that.</v>

61
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a complicated one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

62
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.880
<v Speaker 1>and I learned this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part from reading Carl Jung </v>

63
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.431
<v Speaker 1>and the idea there is that unless you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>really made a commitment to someone like</v>

64
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>a lifetime commitment and that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious commitment,</v>

65
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>one that you're not going to back out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

66
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the seriousness that's</v>

67
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:05.281
<v Speaker 1>necessary to make it have the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible quality and sustainability </v>

68
00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:09.661
<v Speaker 1>across the course of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really important that it is of </v>

69
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>that high quality and sustainability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the relationship,</v>

70
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>especially when it starts to produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

71
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>is a.</v>

72
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.160
<v Speaker 1>A machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say a machine that you jointly </v>

73
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.721
<v Speaker 1>operate that adds immensely to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of your life and the depth of </v>

74
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:22.400
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you.</v>

75
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>You have the rope and strand of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and your partner has the strands in</v>

76
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>the rope of his or her life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then those are tied together to make</v>

77
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>a stronger rope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that unites you across time.</v>

78
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>And then you undertake massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventures together.</v>

79
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:42.331
<v Speaker 1>And some of that is the establishment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a household and the establishment of </v>

80
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:45.931
<v Speaker 1>joint careers and the maintenance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other's mental and physical health </v>

81
00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>and the maintenance of a high quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual life and all of that very,</v>

82
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:52.951
<v Speaker 1>very challenging to do all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the joint production and,</v>

83
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 1>and care of children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

84
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 1>which sets you up properly for the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>half of your life.</v>

85
00:04:58.121 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 55 now,</v>

86
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

87
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 1>both my kids just got engaged in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last month,</v>

88
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>so that's pretty bloody amazing.</v>

89
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.100
<v Speaker 1>And they're both setting up households </v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

90
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>and there are stepping into adulthood </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm fortunate enough to have them in</v>

91
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 1>the city that I live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Hooray for me,</v>

92
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>that's so bloody a fortunate that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly believe it.</v>

93
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:23.101
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've helped them out and tried to make </v>

94
00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:23.101
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

95
00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:26.670
<v Speaker 1>what would you say to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of their living here be </v>

96
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 1>something that's viable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm absolutely thrilled that they're</v>

97
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:33.391
<v Speaker 1>going to be around and I'm looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward immensely to having </v>

98
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:36.571
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else are you going to do when </v>

99
00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 1>you're 55?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

100
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:38.490
<v Speaker 1>when you're going to be 55,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to,</v>

101
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I already have 40 more years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what am I going to do with those </v>

102
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.530
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

103
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.740
<v Speaker 1>so I have a good marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God for that.</v>

104
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly due to the outstanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral quality of my life,</v>

105
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.520
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I'm also extraordinarily attracted </v>

106
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.520
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

107
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.520
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

108
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.841
<v Speaker 1>we've built a life together and we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>had kids together and we're happy with </v>

109
00:05:57.841 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 1>our kids and we had plenty of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of struggle with our kids because one of</v>

110
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>our children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter had serious,</v>

111
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:07.061
<v Speaker 1>serious health problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which she seems to have managed to </v>

112
00:06:07.061 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>resolve partly as a consequence of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>own brilliance.</v>

113
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

114
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:16.571
<v Speaker 1>we've set ourselves up now so that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>children are respectable and mature </v>

115
00:06:16.571 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 1>young adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thank God for that.</v>

116
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.080
<v Speaker 1>And they've got partners who we both </v>
<v Speaker 1>really like and they're gonna have </v>

117
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 1>children and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hooray.</v>

118
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:28.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that this next part of my </v>

119
00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:28.811
<v Speaker 1>life is going to be something that I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>advance into with a,</v>

120
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.930
<v Speaker 1>with a fair bit of hope and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

121
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.150
<v Speaker 1>and excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of having little kids </v>

122
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>around again is thrilling because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really liked little kids.</v>

123
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 1>They're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fun.</v>

124
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>And so there's the shackled together is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more like it's a,</v>

125
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

126
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 1>it's such a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may have even said that,</v>

127
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:47.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's such a cynical way of looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

128
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:52.211
<v Speaker 1>It's more like what you've produced is </v>
<v Speaker 1>an unbreakable bond between two beings </v>

129
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>and that that makes both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of them better in every way.</v>

130
00:06:56.751 --> 00:07:01.751
<v Speaker 1>If it's based on if it's a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's based on trust and genuine </v>

131
00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 1>communication at a very difficult thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to attain because you have to be willing</v>

132
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:09.281
<v Speaker 1>to tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is generally a horrible </v>

133
00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:09.281
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

134
00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:13.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to tell truth when everyone </v>

135
00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:15.701
<v Speaker 1>wants to hear what you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very difficult to tell the </v>

136
00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 1>truth when no one wants to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Least of all yourself.</v>

137
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 1>And so marriage gets a very bad rap in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture and Sodas,</v>

138
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>child rearing.</v>

139
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:27.010
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's absolute catastrophe </v>
<v Speaker 1>because really being in a longterm </v>

140
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:29.030
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a marriage,</v>

141
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having children,</v>

142
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:36.311
<v Speaker 1>that's two thirds of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a highly career oriented </v>

143
00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:40.331
<v Speaker 1>person that's two thirds of your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a highly career oriented person </v>

144
00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:44.620
<v Speaker 1>and my family has been unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to me and has also been </v>

145
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.090
<v Speaker 1>something that's enabled me to be a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective in my career.</v>

146
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Because my house has been a sanctuary </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me and thank God for that.</v>

147
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Especially over on many times in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

148
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:57.050
<v Speaker 1>but especially over the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you should.</v>

149
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.200
<v Speaker 1>You should get to know someone long </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to know that you too can now go </v>

150
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.500
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Communicate and negotiate.</v>

151
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Because the most important part of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship is the fact that you can </v>

152
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:11.660
<v Speaker 1>tell each other the truth and negotiate.</v>
