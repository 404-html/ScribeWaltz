1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're socially anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:05.520
<v Speaker 1>so what happens when you're socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious?</v>

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>You go to a party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your heart's beating.</v>

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The party is a monster.</v>

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's judging you and it's </v>

6
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>judging you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's putting you low down the dominance </v>

7
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.071
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy because that's what a negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment is and that interferes with </v>

8
00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>your sexual soul success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you're being harshly</v>

9
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>evaluated by nature itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

10
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:32.691
<v Speaker 1>So you are confronting the dragon of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos when you go into the social </v>

11
00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what do you do?</v>

12
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>You like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you hunch over and that's low </v>

13
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no threat.</v>

14
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

15
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to get you very far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.030
<v Speaker 1>but that's a logical thing to do in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

17
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>in the face of a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm no threat.</v>

18
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the king and your dad,</v>

19
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm no threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hunched over.</v>

20
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>And then what's happening internally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are,</v>

21
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>what are people thinking about me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are people thinking about me or am </v>

22
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I looking stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I looking foolish?</v>

23
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm awkward.</v>

24
00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I hate being here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

25
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm sweating too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all internalized,</v>

26
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:04.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all self focused,</v>

27
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.300
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

28
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I isn't work,</v>

29
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>the eye isn't working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you tell people?</v>

30
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't stop thinking about yourself </v>

31
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>because you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

32
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>don't think of a white elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white elephant,</v>

33
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>White,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephant,</v>

34
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>White,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephant.</v>

35
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell someone to stop thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about something because they get caught </v>

36
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 1>in the loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do with socially anxious people</v>

37
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at other people.</v>

38
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

39
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you look at them,</v>

40
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>you can tell what they're thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>

41
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>unless you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're terribly socialized and </v>

42
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>some people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people have no social skills and so</v>

43
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.800
<v Speaker 1>the reason they can't go to a party is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't even know how to </v>

44
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.800
<v Speaker 1>introduce themselves.</v>

45
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just no one ever taught </v>
<v Speaker 1>them how to behave and so they're really</v>

46
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:53.151
<v Speaker 1>good candidates for behavior therapy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you walk them through the </v>

47
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:57.921
<v Speaker 1>process of how you actually manifest the</v>
<v Speaker 1>procedures that are associated with </v>

48
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>social acceptability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most people aren't like that.</v>

49
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 1>They have the ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they're really introverted in high</v>

50
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:09.591
<v Speaker 1>in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can usually talk quite well to </v>

51
00:02:09.591 --> 00:02:09.591
<v Speaker 1>someone one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

52
00:02:09.591 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Because they look at them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I look at you,</v>

53
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.940
<v Speaker 1>it's another thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're ever speaking to a group of </v>

54
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never speak to the group of people there</v>

55
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talk to individuals and then they </v>

56
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>reflect for you the entire group because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all in trained.</v>

57
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>You look at one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they broadcast to you what everyone's </v>

58
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>thinking and you know how to talk to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

59
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as you focus on the person,</v>

60
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>not you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you push your attention outward.</v>

61
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Use Your I push your attention outward </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start watching.</v>

62
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:47.331
<v Speaker 1>Well then all your automatic mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick in and you start being awkward </v>

63
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>because if we're talking and I'm looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

64
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>next and I'm going to put disjunctions </v>

65
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>into the like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like a bad chords and the melody</v>

66
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.130
<v Speaker 1>of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our conversation.</v>

67
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is I'm not paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

68
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's why the I is the thing at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the pyramid.</v>

69
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like the thing that enables you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>win the set of all possible dominance </v>

70
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies is the I pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay Attention.</v>

71
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the critical issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why the Egyptians worshiped </v>

72
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.671
<v Speaker 1>horace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why horace was the thing that </v>

73
00:03:20.671 --> 00:03:20.671
<v Speaker 1>rescued Osiris from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the depths.</v>

74
00:03:20.671 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>It's the capacity to pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you pay attention to?</v>

75
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Most?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

76
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Your right hemisphere signals as </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalous.</v>

77
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>It attracts your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this isn't going quite right.</v>

78
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking at that wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you look at.</v>

79
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>That's what you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's not going right,</v>

80
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>because that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

81
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>that's the terrible monster that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat you,</v>

82
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the place you get all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

83
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.460
<v Speaker 1>so that's why it's useful to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions with your enemies because </v>

84
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.051
<v Speaker 1>they will tell you things you do not </v>
<v Speaker 1>know and that's such a great thing </v>

85
00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't know them well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not very smart,</v>

86
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there may be a time when you go</v>

87
00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:03.841
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing you need to know and </v>

88
00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe your enemy will kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you're such a fool,</v>

89
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a bunch of other things that aren't </v>

90
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>true to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even one thing that's accurate,</v>

91
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:10.050
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

92
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.060
<v Speaker 1>thanks very much man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll do some work on that and I </v>

93
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>won't have to carry that forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

94
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 1>And then that's part of the reason again</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the terrible predator.</v>

95
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 1>It's always the terrible Predator that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has the gold.</v>

96
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the person who delivers </v>
<v Speaker 1>the message you do not want to hear.</v>

97
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rough,</v>

98
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is rough.</v>
