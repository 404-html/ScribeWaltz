1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.080
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an appalling ideology because the </v>

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.080
<v Speaker 2>people who created it had the idea about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it should be before they made it.</v>

4
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say exactly what frozen is </v>

5
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's propaganda.</v>

6
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.760
<v Speaker 2>A truly mythologically based story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can never fully say what it's about.</v>

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 2>You can just talk about it forever and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever and ever and ever.</v>

8
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a wellspring of meaning,</v>

9
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.150
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

10
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course that's what they're doing.</v>

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's calculated marketing.</v>

12
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

13
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hyper politically correct.</v>

14
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

15
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't need men and you know,</v>

16
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me a break,</v>

17
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because you need men doesn't mean </v>

18
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 2>you have to like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:54.741
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean I thought a lot about the </v>

20
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:57.051
<v Speaker 2>difference between propaganda and art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So art actually a process rather than an</v>

21
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 2>end product and with any luck if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a piece of art,</v>

22
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:06.471
<v Speaker 2>the process is embedded in the byproduct</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it reflects the process when you </v>

23
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 2>bring it into your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's an active,</v>

24
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.270
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a crystallized active exploration </v>

25
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 2>and the real artist doesn't know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>

26
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're exploring.</v>

27
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can recommend a film.</v>

28
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:25.161
<v Speaker 2>There's a film made of Picasso wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>boat 1957 and it was a black and white </v>

29
00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:29.541
<v Speaker 2>film and it was actually a film of him </v>
<v Speaker 2>making a painting and he painted it on </v>

30
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 2>glass so you could see what he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

31
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 2>It's really quite fascinating because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that he's playing,</v>

32
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.570
<v Speaker 2>he sketches it in and then he rubs it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out so then he sketches it in again and </v>

33
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.081
<v Speaker 2>he rubs it out and he sketches over here</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like there's a real dynamism </v>

34
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't plan it out to begin with.</v>

35
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Not that there's necessarily anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with that as an artistic endeavor </v>

36
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.081
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But PAGASA was trying to explore and </v>

37
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 2>understand and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you knew about cubism,</v>

38
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 2>but cubism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a strange thing.</v>

39
00:01:55.141 --> 00:02:00.141
<v Speaker 2>But what he was doing with his cubism </v>
<v Speaker 2>was to try to show you that you only see</v>

40
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:05.241
<v Speaker 2>things from one perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the things exist in multiple </v>

41
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

42
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 2>a cubist painting is your face this way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your face this way at the same time.</v>

43
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Speaker 2>And so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

44
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:17.121
<v Speaker 2>is that a more accurate way of of </v>
<v Speaker 2>representing a person that just the </v>

45
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:20.441
<v Speaker 2>standard portrait and Picasso would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well in some ways definitely because it </v>

46
00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 2>captures the transformative element </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than the static element.</v>

47
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 2>And so someone who's a true artist </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a political message.</v>

48
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.910
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny because my house is full </v>
<v Speaker 2>of ideological propaganda from the </v>

49
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just packed full of it and it's so </v>

50
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.761
<v Speaker 2>interesting to watch these artifacts </v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of them were socialist </v>

51
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 2>realist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although mostly they're impressionist.</v>

52
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:46.881
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting to watch them </v>

53
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:49.161
<v Speaker 2>because in that painting themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a war that you can perceive and</v>

54
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:54.381
<v Speaker 2>the war is a lot of the people who made </v>
<v Speaker 2>these paintings were incredibly </v>

55
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 2>talented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

56
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 2>really skilled because the Russians kept</v>
<v Speaker 2>their.</v>

57
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Their Formula Academy's open so the can </v>
<v Speaker 2>really paint impressionism.</v>

58
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:05.971
<v Speaker 2>It's remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their talents were encapsulated </v>

59
00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:09.541
<v Speaker 2>within this what mostly this ideology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so in each canvas there's this war </v>

60
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:14.701
<v Speaker 2>between the ideological message and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>artistic message and what's so cool is </v>

61
00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 2>the farther we get away from the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union,</v>

62
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.630
<v Speaker 2>the more the art winds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in 300 years there isn't going </v>

63
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.241
<v Speaker 2>to be a shred left of that ideology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that will be left to the paintings </v>

64
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:25.241
<v Speaker 2>is the art,</v>

65
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.180
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

66
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that people are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>attracted to art is because the artist </v>

67
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.961
<v Speaker 2>actually manifests identity with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process of transformation and so that's </v>

68
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:41.210
<v Speaker 2>why the artist is a cultural hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's also why every nihilist worth his</v>

69
00:03:41.211 --> 00:03:44.030
<v Speaker 2>salt wants to be an artist like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are you?</v>

70
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.580
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a nihilist snow.</v>

71
00:03:46.581 --> 00:03:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

72
00:03:47.721 --> 00:03:48.350
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

73
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>but I can see why you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

74
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.980
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

75
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Just because you're a failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean you're an artist.</v>

76
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

77
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it depends on who you are.</v>

78
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting to me,</v>

79
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 2>but I'm really interested enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

80
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:17.281
<v Speaker 2>and I'm also interested in the way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies coopt more fundamental </v>

81
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 2>processes to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

82
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.450
<v Speaker 2>and harness their energy as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a rational and motivating force.</v>

83
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.720
<v Speaker 2>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these pieces of art propaganda are </v>

84
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 2>extremely interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

85
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting to be surrounded </v>
<v Speaker 2>by them because I can see this war going</v>

86
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 2>on all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very cool.</v>

87
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 2>And there are twinning far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell,</v>

88
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 2>so that's very interesting because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were pure propaganda,</v>

89
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:53.461
<v Speaker 2>many of them when I bought them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's getting farther and farther </v>

90
00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:56.311
<v Speaker 2>away from the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the more architectural elements are </v>

91
00:04:56.311 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 2>coming to the forefront.</v>
