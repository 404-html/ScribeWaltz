1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.110
<v Speaker 1>People wish upon a star because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some intuition that aiming above </v>

2
00:00:05.331 --> 00:00:09.860
<v Speaker 1>the mundane has the potential to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transform themselves.</v>

3
00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:11.600
<v Speaker 1>They make a wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.650
<v Speaker 1>if you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a wish.</v>

5
00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:20.651
<v Speaker 1>You should aim at something high and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even just aiming at that is more likely </v>

6
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:25.340
<v Speaker 1>to make the wish come true and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a metaphor.</v>

7
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this program which you guys are </v>

8
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.300
<v Speaker 1>going to do called the future authoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>program is one of two assignments.</v>

9
00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 1>One is that you write an autobiography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the past authoring.</v>

10
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.330
<v Speaker 1>The other is that you write a plan for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

11
00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:43.331
<v Speaker 1>That's the future authoring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend that you get started </v>

12
00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:43.331
<v Speaker 1>on those right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not right now,</v>

13
00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:48.071
<v Speaker 1>but like really soon because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>harder than you think and some of you </v>

14
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:49.970
<v Speaker 1>are going to write like 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

15
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get sucked right in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This happens all the time.</v>

16
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get sucked right into it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you write an autobiography </v>

17
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.651
<v Speaker 1>because you need to know where you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>and who you are right now because how </v>

18
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 1>the hell are you going to plot a pathway</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the future?</v>

19
00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:09.371
<v Speaker 1>Unless you know where you are and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to write about the future </v>

20
00:01:09.371 --> 00:01:10.550
<v Speaker 1>because you going to hit something </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless he aim at it,</v>

21
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lots of times people won't admit </v>

22
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.540
<v Speaker 1>what they want because they're afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason they're afraid is because if </v>

23
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.991
<v Speaker 1>you specify what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've specified your conditions of </v>

24
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:27.111
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you fail and it's better </v>

25
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:27.111
<v Speaker 1>just to keep it foggy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

26
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:32.031
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm succeeding or </v>

27
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:32.031
<v Speaker 1>failing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

28
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:32.031
<v Speaker 1>I can't really tell while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

29
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Except you can't hit anything you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>aim at.</v>

30
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>And so the future authoring program is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

31
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an attempt to have you articulate your </v>

32
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as the past authoring program,</v>

33
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.640
<v Speaker 1>who are you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past authoring program and asked you</v>

34
00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:54.250
<v Speaker 1>to break your life into the parks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then to write about the emotional,</v>

35
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that you regard as important </v>

36
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 1>important events that have shaped who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are and you know,</v>

37
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:06.751
<v Speaker 1>you may find that some of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that writing makes you </v>

38
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.011
<v Speaker 1>emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say if you have a memory that's </v>

39
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:09.560
<v Speaker 1>more than 18 months old roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

40
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:13.190
<v Speaker 1>and when you bring it to mind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has an emotional impact,</v>

41
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>especially in negative emotional impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

42
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like part of your soul is stuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>back there and I know that's a </v>

43
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I mean is that</v>

44
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.740
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you still experience the</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion is because you have not solved </v>

45
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.730
<v Speaker 1>the problem that that situation face do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

46
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 1>It might be a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you got tangled up with </v>

47
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 1>someone who was really bad and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>rough man,</v>

48
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.601
<v Speaker 1>because you got to come up with a theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>of malevolence to deal with something </v>

49
00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:46.430
<v Speaker 1>like that and that's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's still produces emotion,</v>

50
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>it means you haven't solved the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and your.</v>

51
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Your brain is still pegging it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>

52
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:56.621
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a part of your territory that you </v>

53
00:02:56.621 --> 00:02:56.621
<v Speaker 1>did not master threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat,</v>

54
00:02:56.621 --> 00:02:56.621
<v Speaker 1>threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat,</v>

55
00:02:56.621 --> 00:03:00.971
<v Speaker 1>threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and until you take it apart and </v>

56
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.620
<v Speaker 1>articulation really helps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that writing really helps that then </v>

57
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to free yourself from </v>
<v Speaker 1>its grip and that what might not be that</v>

58
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:11.911
<v Speaker 1>pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is one of those situations </v>

59
00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:14.191
<v Speaker 1>were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tends to produce a detriment in </v>

60
00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>people's mood in the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but quite radical improvements,</v>

61
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:19.380
<v Speaker 1>three to six months down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.390
<v Speaker 1>and it's often the case that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately have to do something you </v>

63
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>don't want to do in order to progress.</v>

64
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common.</v>

65
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.370
<v Speaker 1>So in the future authoring program asks </v>
<v Speaker 1>you about different dimensions of your </v>

66
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like because you're,</v>

67
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of yourself as a </v>

68
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.131
<v Speaker 1>personality inside your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your nested in systems that </v>

69
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>transcend you and they're just as real </v>
<v Speaker 1>as whatever's in your head.</v>

70
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

71
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 1>what do you need for life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty easy actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some friends,</v>

73
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.820
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intimate relationship,</v>

74
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Family,</v>

75
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.610
<v Speaker 1>you know either the one you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce or the one that you come from </v>

76
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>where people to some degree of love and </v>
<v Speaker 1>care for one another.</v>

77
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing to work on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need,</v>

78
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.600
<v Speaker 1>you need some plan for your career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to fit in somewhere that </v>

79
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.651
<v Speaker 1>people regard as important and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll trade with you so that you can </v>

80
00:04:16.651 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need something worthwhile to do with</v>

81
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 1>the time that you're not at work and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to pay attention to your mental and</v>

82
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 1>physical health and you need to regulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>your use of substances,</v>

83
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.970
<v Speaker 1>which is a strange one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but alcohol does lots of people in so </v>

84
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.970
<v Speaker 1>it's worth.</v>

85
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>It's worth thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we put it in there,</v>

86
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>so then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

87
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from your friends?</v>

88
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.720
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from your career?</v>

89
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 1>If you could have what you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the program asks you.</v>

90
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Three to five years down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to have what you want.</v>

91
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm assuming that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach this like,</v>

92
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable adults and not like 13 year </v>

93
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.161
<v Speaker 1>old dreamers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I want the most expensive yacht </v>

94
00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like fine,</v>

95
00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:05.011
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't really what it's supposed to </v>

96
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:08.941
<v Speaker 1>be more concentrating on your character </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then it asks you to write for 15 </v>

97
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:15.001
<v Speaker 1>minutes without thinking too much about </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammar or sentence structure.</v>

98
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:20.221
<v Speaker 1>Any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what your life could be like three </v>

99
00:05:20.221 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>to five years down the road if you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>treating yourself like someone you cared</v>

100
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:28.411
<v Speaker 1>for and you were helping them figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they wanted and then it asks you to</v>

101
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:34.141
<v Speaker 1>do the same thing in reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to think about the ways that </v>

102
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:39.511
<v Speaker 1>you're radically insufficient and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>faults and everyone knows this.</v>

103
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.930
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 1>maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone has a sense of if they were</v>

105
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>going to degenerate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they would do it.</v>

106
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people would be an alcoholic,</v>

107
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:53.941
<v Speaker 1>some people would be a street person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's some doom thing out </v>

108
00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:57.541
<v Speaker 1>there that's got your name on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're particularly in cautious and </v>

109
00:05:57.541 --> 00:05:58.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

110
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 1>And let things fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so want you to write about that.</v>

111
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 1>What do you not want to have happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>three to five years?</v>

112
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>And there's psychological reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

113
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>A one is if you have something to aim </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

114
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:18.041
<v Speaker 1>that's a source of positive emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your positive emotion is mostly </v>

115
00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 1>generated by evidence that you're moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards something that you value.</v>

116
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not generated so much by </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishing something because when you</v>

117
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.680
<v Speaker 1>accomplish something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just left with the problem of </v>

118
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.680
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're going to do next.</v>

119
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>So you graduate from university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

120
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hooray.</v>

121
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>One day you're at the peak of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduate university career.</v>

122
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 1>The next day you're unemployed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for a bad job at starbucks.</v>

123
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 1>well you see what I mean is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:45.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that,</v>

126
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one problem that you solve is replaced </v>

127
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.141
<v Speaker 1>by another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that you're going to be </v>

128
00:06:53.141 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 1>happy when you solve all your problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like good luck with that theory.</v>

129
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.590
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

130
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:02.591
<v Speaker 1>if you're aiming at something worthwhile</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you really believe it's worthwhile </v>

131
00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:02.591
<v Speaker 1>and you've thought it through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 1>so that you're not weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not weak,</v>

133
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 1>you've got your damn arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mustard.</v>

134
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Then when you make progress even a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

135
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

136
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 1>that's all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get a little kick,</v>

137
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.030
<v Speaker 1>a little dopamine kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you want because that's </v>

138
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.030
<v Speaker 1>where your positive emotion comes from.</v>

139
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.620
<v Speaker 1>You can use cocaine if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

140
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:24.060
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tends to have relatively </v>

141
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 1>detrimental medium to longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences,</v>

142
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:30.130
<v Speaker 1>but it activates the same system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be aiming at something </v>

143
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.930
<v Speaker 1>and you should be aiming at something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's realistic that you want,</v>

144
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 1>that you could get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not easily because if it's easy,</v>

146
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.440
<v Speaker 1>in some sense you've already got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to push you.</v>

147
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

148
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:47.591
<v Speaker 1>because there's two things that you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do when you're pursuing something </v>

149
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:49.100
<v Speaker 1>that's important and one of them is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get the thing that's important.</v>

150
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:54.340
<v Speaker 1>But the other is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to make yourself better at pursuing </v>

151
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:54.340
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

152
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can get both of those at the same</v>

153
00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Speaker 1>time you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

154
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at something and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing your competence.</v>

155
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:05.831
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good deal and there's a lot of </v>

156
00:08:05.831 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic meaning to be felt in that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the second half of the program you,</v>

157
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.270
<v Speaker 1>you write out a plan for how you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do it and how you're going to </v>

158
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.301
<v Speaker 1>keep yourself on track and you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to write about why it would be good for </v>

159
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:22.181
<v Speaker 1>you if you did this and why it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for your family and what possible </v>

160
00:08:22.181 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 1>benefits it would have to the community </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you want to nail this thing down</v>

161
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:29.681
<v Speaker 1>and then you want to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of obstacles are going to come up </v>

162
00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:32.090
<v Speaker 1>and how you might overcome them and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might keep yourself on track and all</v>

163
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:32.450
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

164
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:37.450
<v Speaker 1>And we know because we've actually done </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of research on this particular </v>

165
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.471
<v Speaker 1>program that if university students do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and this is more true.</v>

166
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:45.050
<v Speaker 1>If they're not too well oriented to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>

167
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.560
<v Speaker 1>If University students do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're about 25 percent less likely to </v>

168
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>drop out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is lot and about their grade point</v>

169
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 1>average increases about 20 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Hooray for that,</v>

170
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you never know when you develop </v>

171
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:02.780
<v Speaker 1>an intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's gonna work,</v>

172
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.960
<v Speaker 1>there's also evidence but not from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>lab.</v>

173
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.590
<v Speaker 1>That doing such things improves your </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical health and I think the reason </v>

174
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 1>for that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 1>when you go over your autobiography and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you scour out those negative places that</v>

176
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:18.741
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of dragging along with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lowers your overall stress load </v>

177
00:09:18.741 --> 00:09:23.360
<v Speaker 1>because your brain is kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's calculating how dangerous </v>

178
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.751
<v Speaker 1>the world is by attending to the ratio </v>
<v Speaker 1>of successes to failures that you've had</v>

179
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

180
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:34.671
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there are holes in your map that you </v>

181
00:09:34.671 --> 00:09:37.911
<v Speaker 1>could still fall through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your brain regards the territory </v>

182
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 1>still as a bit on the dangerous side and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you more prepared for emergency </v>

183
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.131
<v Speaker 1>action and that's hard on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to go back there and fix up </v>

184
00:09:46.131 --> 00:09:49.590
<v Speaker 1>those experiences is to the degree that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
