1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi Dr Peterson over the last couple of </v>

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.740
<v Speaker 1>weeks and further back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk a lot about consciousness and </v>

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.381
<v Speaker 1>the importance of it and I was hoping to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your opinion on an issue of </v>

4
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:14.741
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that has often seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity among other groups and </v>

5
00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:19.061
<v Speaker 1>politics kind of clash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm hoping to get your views on the </v>

6
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:23.440
<v Speaker 1>consciousness or lack thereof of a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>fetus and how that's impacted your views</v>

7
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>on abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they are and any.</v>

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.020
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

10
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 2>so the first question is do I have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer for that?</v>

11
00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a good enough answer to actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>reveal.</v>

12
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

13
00:00:58.071 --> 00:01:03.071
<v Speaker 2>but I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll I can flail about a little bit </v>

14
00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 2>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abortion is clearly wrong.</v>

15
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Don't think anybody debates that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't recommend that someone that you</v>

16
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:12.650
<v Speaker 2>love have one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

17
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:17.651
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having clarified that that mere </v>

18
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:20.810
<v Speaker 2>statement doesn't eliminate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity of the situation.</v>

19
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 2>The first question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is should everything wrong be illegal?</v>

20
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that's wrong isn't illegal.</v>

21
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Then there's the additional complication</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the difference,</v>

22
00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:41.881
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in gravity regarding the problem in </v>

23
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 2>relationship to men and women and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to deal with that.</v>

24
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that it's actually the wrong</v>

25
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.400
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something Leonard Cohen said </v>

26
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 2>once he said that in a massacre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no decent place to stand,</v>

27
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 2>and what he meant by that was sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're aware there is no good decision </v>

28
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what you do.</v>

29
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong.</v>

30
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.010
<v Speaker 2>So then the question is how did you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

31
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're in a position where you</v>

32
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 2>are inclined to seek an abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

33
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.270
<v Speaker 2>how did you get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we have a lot to straighten out </v>

34
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.830
<v Speaker 2>about the sexual relationships between </v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women.</v>

35
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.850
<v Speaker 2>In the modern world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're bent and warped and demented out</v>

36
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:36.851
<v Speaker 2>of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I see with young </v>

37
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:36.851
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

38
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:39.700
<v Speaker 2>is that they will engage in sexual acts </v>
<v Speaker 2>with one another that they would not </v>

39
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.670
<v Speaker 2>talk about with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

40
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.280
<v Speaker 2>couples will do that for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like married couples will do that,</v>

41
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:46.040
<v Speaker 2>but they're married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a different story.</v>

42
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.520
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that if you are willing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to engage in a sexual act with someone </v>

43
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 2>with whom you would not discuss that </v>
<v Speaker 2>act,</v>

44
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:54.380
<v Speaker 2>you probably put the cart before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>horse,</v>

45
00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 2>so the discussion regarding the legality</v>
<v Speaker 2>of abortion is nested inside a larger </v>

46
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:08.161
<v Speaker 2>discussion about the morality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>abortion and that's nested inside a </v>

47
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:14.521
<v Speaker 2>larger discussion about the proper place</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sexuality and human behavior and to </v>

48
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 2>me that's the level at which the problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to be addressed.</v>

49
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't have the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

50
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 2>because they will answer was get married</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

51
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a good answer and it's an answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people should still listen to,</v>

52
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 2>but we'll put that aside momentarily.</v>

53
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.540
<v Speaker 2>I had a client at one point who was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

54
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 2>she was probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to disguise her in a </v>

55
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 2>variety of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was 27,</v>

56
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:47.701
<v Speaker 2>20 or thereabouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had come from a relatively conservative </v>

57
00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:47.701
<v Speaker 2>background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a timid,</v>

58
00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:52.470
<v Speaker 2>fearful person and also not very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not sophisticated in relationship to </v>

59
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 2>relationships and she'd never had sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

60
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of things she'd never </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

61
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

62
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.790
<v Speaker 2>the answer from me to her wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>continued to be timid about everything </v>

63
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 2>because that wasn't working out for her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She needed to go have some adventures.</v>

64
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual adventures like other adventures </v>

65
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.181
<v Speaker 2>are dangerous and so you have to be very</v>
<v Speaker 2>careful when you encourage people to go </v>

66
00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 2>out and have adventures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

67
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but too much.</v>

68
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Timidity and caution also constitutes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathway to perdition.</v>

69
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:36.841
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you can't just say to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning world while you know,</v>

70
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:42.781
<v Speaker 2>sex till you're married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're going to get married when </v>

71
00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:42.781
<v Speaker 2>you're very young and perhaps you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should.</v>

72
00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:47.641
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that we're mature </v>

73
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 2>enough as a culture to have a serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion about sexual impropriety,</v>

74
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 2>especially in the aftermath of the birth</v>
<v Speaker 2>control pill.</v>

75
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 2>And we seriously need to do that and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have it.</v>

76
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.580
<v Speaker 2>And so I think the eternal debate about </v>
<v Speaker 2>abortion,</v>

77
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 2>horrible as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

78
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.730
<v Speaker 2>it's the surface manifestation of a much</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeper problem.</v>

79
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Now I talked a little bit today about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the utility of marriage,</v>

80
00:05:11.781 --> 00:05:16.781
<v Speaker 2>like the spiritual utility of marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's something that I think we're </v>

81
00:05:17.871 --> 00:05:20.480
<v Speaker 2>so immaturely cynical as a culture like </v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>

82
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 2>We're not wise enough to look at an </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution like marriage and to really </v>

83
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.060
<v Speaker 2>think about what it means and what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>signifies.</v>

84
00:05:26.061 --> 00:05:31.061
<v Speaker 2>It signifies a place that people can tie</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ropes of their lives together so </v>

85
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:35.111
<v Speaker 2>that they're stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It signifies a place where people can </v>

86
00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:36.020
<v Speaker 2>tell the truth to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It signifies a place where sexuality can</v>

87
00:05:36.021 --> 00:05:38.840
<v Speaker 2>properly be integrated into life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's no easy.</v>

88
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.810
<v Speaker 2>That's no easy task.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a place where children,</v>

89
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.630
<v Speaker 2>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be put first and foremost as they</v>

90
00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:49.631
<v Speaker 2>should be once they exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's a much broader discussion</v>

91
00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:55.601
<v Speaker 2>that has to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think before any concentration on the </v>

92
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 2>legality of abortion is labeled to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere at all.</v>

93
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.130
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the best I can do with that </v>

94
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.130
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

95
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.340
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
