1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>As another way of representing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon of chaos stands for the </v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.340
<v Speaker 1>potential that surrounds us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inside of that,</v>

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.120
<v Speaker 1>there's the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown that you actually come into </v>

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.120
<v Speaker 1>contact with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the unknown as it actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself in your world as </v>

6
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.890
<v Speaker 1>something you don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of just the potential for that,</v>

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Speaker 1>because we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.430
<v Speaker 1>you know perfectly well that as you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting here,</v>

9
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.280
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of things you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know everywhere,</v>

10
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>but where are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>they're not manifesting themselves at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment.</v>

12
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:33.110
<v Speaker 1>They're only in potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could.</v>

13
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.230
<v Speaker 1>We could have a discussion that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>became argumentative and then all of a </v>

14
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.101
<v Speaker 1>sudden it would be as if emissaries of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that unknown had entered the space and </v>

15
00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>that's the unknown that's defined in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to what you know.</v>

16
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:48.080
<v Speaker 1>That's what you actually experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of it only being potential.</v>

17
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough thing to get because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both unknown,</v>

18
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:50.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.650
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

20
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:56.651
<v Speaker 1>how can there be two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories of unknown while latent and </v>

21
00:00:56.651 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>manifest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

22
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you in a relationship,</v>

23
00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:04.061
<v Speaker 1>it's going stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know that sooner or later </v>

24
00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>something will come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

25
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>op from where?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

26
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Up from beneath?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean beneath?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While it's from.</v>

28
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>It's from your complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person you're in,</v>

29
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:19.821
<v Speaker 1>a relationship with it in width is </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated and complex that's implicit </v>

30
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 1>in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

31
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 1>it's inside your conceptual structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

32
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 1>that's the way of looking at it now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then when there's a disagreement,</v>

33
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 1>it will manifest itself and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know that they're still trouble</v>

34
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.220
<v Speaker 1>brewing ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interrelationship always,</v>

35
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.870
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of what keeps them </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

36
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>The interesting piece of empirical work </v>
<v Speaker 1>done on this awhile back,</v>

37
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 1>so you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 1>what is the optimal relationship look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in terms of positive and negative </v>

39
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 1>emotion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

40
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Utopia,</v>

41
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>nothing but positive interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no.</v>

42
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine you get people to code the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions they have with their </v>

43
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.560
<v Speaker 1>partner during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>you sample it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

45
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>was that interaction positive or </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative?</v>

46
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>And then what you're trying to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict the longevity of the </v>

47
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

48
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.571
<v Speaker 1>so here's the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it falls under five positive </v>

49
00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>interactions to one negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction,</v>

50
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>the relationship doesn't continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

51
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Too much negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's easy to understand.</v>

52
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.670
<v Speaker 1>If it exceeds 11 positive to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>

53
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>the relationship doesn't last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

54
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 2>No challenge,</v>

55
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from your partner?</v>

56
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Bless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

57
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

58
00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:35.341
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want periods of peace punctuated by </v>

59
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:36.850
<v Speaker 1>a good fight and that because that means</v>
<v Speaker 1>you respect them,</v>

60
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.040
<v Speaker 1>means you have something to offer each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and it means that you're both </v>

61
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 1>growing and so you don't want the fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be too dramatic because,</v>

62
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.700
<v Speaker 1>well then you retreat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't settle it,</v>

63
00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:50.701
<v Speaker 1>but the person that you can completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>map and who only does positive things </v>

64
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:50.770
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a.</v>

65
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't know that person B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not communicating with you nor </v>

66
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.191
<v Speaker 1>you with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're just subordinating </v>

67
00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>themselves to you or you to them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not growing.</v>

68
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.220
<v Speaker 1>You want someone who can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real relationship is a wrestling </v>

69
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a grappling,</v>

70
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>grappling phenomena that you both </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerged,</v>

71
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>transformed from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what people want.</v>

72
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.990
<v Speaker 1>They don't want a pushover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Not unless there's something wrong </v>

73
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.961
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when narcissistic person who never </v>

74
00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:22.291
<v Speaker 1>wants to be challenged will want a </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner who does nothing but deliver </v>

75
00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>exactly what they're told to deliver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they will mistreat the beyond belief</v>

76
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps deservedly so.</v>
