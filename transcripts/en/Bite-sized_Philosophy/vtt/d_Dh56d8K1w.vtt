1
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to do well in the class </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get a bad grade.</v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're in this little frame.</v>

3
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>You want to get a good grade that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

4
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:11.640
<v Speaker 1>He got a bad grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>what is it that's manifesting itself as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad grade?</v>

6
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>While you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a c minus on a piece of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

8
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really.</v>

9
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Know that that's the objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation.</v>

10
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>You got a piece of paper with a c minus </v>
<v Speaker 1>the value free proposition is that </v>

11
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.550
<v Speaker 1>you've been delivered a piece of paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a curve on it.</v>

12
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>A little negative side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you say,</v>

13
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what that is.</v>

14
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's as dopey is thinking,</v>

15
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you got your failing grade.</v>

16
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>You go into the lab and you weigh it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a scale.</v>

17
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Then you burn it and see what it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>made of.</v>

18
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>why did I get so upset about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just paper.</v>

20
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

21
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.010
<v Speaker 1>that's not just paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an entity that exists in a web of </v>

22
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.461
<v Speaker 1>connections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it signified by papers </v>

23
00:00:58.461 --> 00:00:58.461
<v Speaker 1>almost completely irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

24
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>The answer is you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why when you pick it up,</v>

25
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:07.521
<v Speaker 1>you get this paralyzed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sinking feeling because your limbic </v>

26
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:11.481
<v Speaker 1>system is a lot smarter than your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptual systems and your perceptual </v>

27
00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>systems say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>that's a piece of paper and your limbic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system says,</v>

29
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure dragon.</v>

30
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

31
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:23.361
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're sweating and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you put it away and you go play </v>

32
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 1>video games because you know better the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical dragon,</v>

33
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>then the real dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so instead you pull out the piece of</v>

34
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>paper maybe and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

35
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.480
<v Speaker 1>why did I get this c minus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a hell of a question,</v>

36
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

37
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe you're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:45.291
<v Speaker 1>that could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least stupid compared to who you </v>

39
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:45.291
<v Speaker 1>think you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>

40
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>that's the real horror that's lurking </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

41
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

42
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was kind of smart.</v>

43
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a proposition of the highest </v>

44
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.400
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was kind of smart.</v>

45
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

46
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>well what about this c minus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

47
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>well that God damn professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been attacked by a predator.</v>

49
00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the first response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

50
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a nonsensical message.</v>

51
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>It's just delivered by someone evil in </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory.</v>

52
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't go there.</v>

54
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't go there first necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

55
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.760
<v Speaker 1>But then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then say you don't go there.</v>

56
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:23.271
<v Speaker 1>so what is this exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you not know what you thought you </v>

58
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>knew?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you not who you think you are?</v>

59
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you don't work hard enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are Your values not organized properly?</v>

60
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you misuse your time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you in the wrong field?</v>

61
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Is the way you're construing Your Life </v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely Inappropriate?</v>

62
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:40.791
<v Speaker 1>Are you acting out what your parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted you to do and you're pissed off </v>

63
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:43.941
<v Speaker 1>about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're only running at 40 percent to </v>

64
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>spite them despite the fact that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying $25,000</v>

65
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>a year for your education because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fun game.</v>

66
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go do what you want me to do,</v>

67
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:54.021
<v Speaker 1>but I'll fail at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not completely because then that </v>

68
00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:58.071
<v Speaker 1>would cost you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just fail a little bit so that you </v>

69
00:02:58.071 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>have to spend all that money forcing me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to what I don't want to do,</v>

70
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>but you'll never get to escape from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then every time we interact,</v>

71
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll stab you in various ways that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't quite understand,</v>

72
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.640
<v Speaker 1>just to show you how irritated I am that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I happened to be acting out the destiny </v>

73
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>that you've put forward for me.</v>

74
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.280
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's part of the Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

75
00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:19.281
<v Speaker 1>And then that pulls in the whole parent </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and these are bottomless pits.</v>

76
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Often when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in the world and something </v>

77
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>objects to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that matters,</v>

78
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>objects to you than the entire on </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized world is in that thing that </v>

79
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all tangled up inside.</v>

80
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>If that's why it's the great dragon of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

81
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>It's everything that's outside of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual structure and what is that?</v>

82
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>It's everything that lurks outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

83
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.500
<v Speaker 1>of your walled city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's manifested itself like the </v>

84
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>snake in the garden and the easiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do is say,</v>

85
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not having anything to do with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that is,</v>

86
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get your c minus and you don't do </v>

87
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.131
<v Speaker 1>anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're a little bitter and more </v>

88
00:03:59.131 --> 00:03:59.131
<v Speaker 1>resentful and your study habits get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little worse.</v>

89
00:03:59.131 --> 00:04:03.270
<v Speaker 1>So the next time you get like a d plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you collect a bunch of f's and </v>

90
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>then you stopped going to school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you stop showering,</v>

91
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you end up jumping off the bridge.</v>

92
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.390
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how the dragon eats you when you </v>

94
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 1>don't pay attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's no bloody wonder that people</v>

95
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:15.700
<v Speaker 1>avoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.940
<v Speaker 1>it's really no wonder that they avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>because error messages contain within </v>

97
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.591
<v Speaker 1>them the implicit world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the upside of that is while they </v>

98
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:30.661
<v Speaker 1>contain within them the implicit world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the world isn't all negative and so </v>

99
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:34.771
<v Speaker 1>maybe you get your c minus and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the best gift you ever got </v>

100
00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 1>because somebody finally took you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>went whack,</v>

101
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clue in.</v>

102
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>And so you take that apart and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

103
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to write.</v>

104
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to think.</v>

105
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>I've never read anything in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My study habits are abysmal.</v>

106
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:51.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe I'm working at two percent </v>

107
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:51.121
<v Speaker 1>efficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

108
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:51.121
<v Speaker 1>which is probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would suspect that,</v>

109
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you aren't doing that,</v>

110
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:57.811
<v Speaker 1>but I bet you that I bet there's 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 to 50 percent of the people in the </v>

111
00:04:57.811 --> 00:04:59.350
<v Speaker 1>room are working at two percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiency.</v>

112
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>

113
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 1>So to find that out is so optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're barely hanging in </v>

114
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're only working at two percent,</v>

115
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:09.330
<v Speaker 1>you might imagine what you could have as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a life if you work at,</v>

116
00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:11.950
<v Speaker 1>at like 50 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

117
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.220
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the c minus can be the best gift you </v>

118
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>ever had and that's the gold that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon hordes,</v>

119
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what that means.</v>

120
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.570
<v Speaker 1>And so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're moving from point a to point </v>

121
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.570
<v Speaker 1>b.</v>

122
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.950
<v Speaker 1>In your little circumscribed world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've made everything invisible and as </v>

123
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 1>long as that works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your theory is good enough.</v>

124
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>It's accurate enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true enough,</v>

125
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.500
<v Speaker 1>you're in your little paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if something comes up and objects,</v>

126
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 1>well that's where your character is </v>
<v Speaker 1>tested.</v>

127
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the character test.</v>

128
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like what do you do with messages </v>
<v Speaker 1>of error?</v>

129
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's a tricky issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

130
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:49.690
<v Speaker 1>so here's the solution to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what not to do.</v>

131
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.210
<v Speaker 1>I am a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to see my.</v>

132
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might as well just go jump off the </v>

133
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.340
<v Speaker 1>bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

134
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

135
00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Because what means is that every time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you try to learn something,</v>

136
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make a mistake because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you know?</v>

137
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the rule is every time you make a</v>

138
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go jump off the bridge,</v>

139
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>then that's not a useful problem solving</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>

140
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.120
<v Speaker 1>And so when you make a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to beat yourself to death </v>

141
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 1>with a club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad strategy,</v>

142
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:22.781
<v Speaker 1>and you'll have your internal tyrant in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there who's perfectly happy about doing </v>

143
00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:26.351
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the overactive super ego that </v>

144
00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Freud talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it came to you via a parent who </v>

145
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.390
<v Speaker 1>was too authoritarian or a grandparent </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a,</v>

146
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.770
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's just you because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable in neurotic.</v>

147
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll take your hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious.</v>

148
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 1>You'll take yourself apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

149
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.750
<v Speaker 1>starting the so you've got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something has objected to you.</v>

150
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

151
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

152
00:06:48.111 --> 00:06:49.640
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not looking at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

153
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your goals are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're not acting properly.</v>

154
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.850
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the question that arises when an </v>

155
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.641
<v Speaker 1>obstacle emerges is which part of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure needs attention?</v>

156
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.990
<v Speaker 1>And the first answer can't be all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why when you're arguing with </v>

157
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:13.211
<v Speaker 1>someone in an intimate relationship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're angry at them and you want to </v>

158
00:07:13.211 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a big mistake,</v>

159
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.590
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say,</v>

160
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 1>well you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you're like,</v>

161
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
<v Speaker 1>here's another 10 examples of how you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>done that in the past and I can </v>

162
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.000
<v Speaker 1>enumerate more of them if you'd like.</v>

163
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:29.110
<v Speaker 1>And so it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually what you like and I've </v>

164
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.791
<v Speaker 1>tried fixing you and didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it looks like you're going to be </v>

165
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:31.791
<v Speaker 1>like that up into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're basically saying to them,</v>

166
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:32.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a bad person.</v>

167
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:38.110
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing they can do is either</v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse or punch you and punching you </v>

168
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.620
<v Speaker 1>is actually better than collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't.</v>

169
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:44.621
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a counterproductive way of </v>

170
00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:44.621
<v Speaker 1>arguing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't leave the person handing out.</v>

171
00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:47.360
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe while they're civilized so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't get physical,</v>

172
00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that's good and maybe it </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>

173
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.760
<v Speaker 1>But then they end up either really not </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy with you in a way that they will </v>

174
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.971
<v Speaker 1>manifest the first possible opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get or they have to go off in the </v>

175
00:07:57.971 --> 00:07:57.980
<v Speaker 1>corner and cringe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

176
00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.060
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won.</v>

177
00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like now your partners either hates</v>
<v Speaker 1>you or is cringing.</v>

178
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.860
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real good victory man.</v>

179
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Rack up about 100 victories like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll be in divorce court and </v>

180
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.990
<v Speaker 1>spending $250,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>while being miserable about it.</v>

181
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

182
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:16.460
<v Speaker 1>so something objects to you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

183
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:17.270
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I need to,</v>

184
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I need to take myself apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

185
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a piece that's broken </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and then you might think,</v>

186
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:28.061
<v Speaker 1>well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's assume it's a little piece to </v>

187
00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:28.061
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the right mechanism.</v>

188
00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:28.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

189
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:33.340
<v Speaker 1>you got a c minus that doesn't prove </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're stupid and now it implies </v>

190
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 1>that you might be stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't.</v>

191
00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really it does.</v>

192
00:08:37.341 --> 00:08:38.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you don't want to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

193
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:43.481
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it implies that you're lazier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implies that you're ignorant or like it </v>

194
00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:46.871
<v Speaker 1>implies all sorts of terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might imply that you're a bad person </v>

195
00:08:46.871 --> 00:08:50.171
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to leap to that and </v>

196
00:08:50.171 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the proclamation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocence before guilt.</v>

197
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Assume that you're the least amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible and ignorant possible.</v>

198
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>And so then you look at the micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>routines.</v>

199
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I got a c minus in this course.</v>

200
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I should study for that course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes more a day for the next three</v>

201
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you ask yourself,</v>

202
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:11.010
<v Speaker 1>do you think you could do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

203
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm too useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

204
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.390
<v Speaker 1>how about 15 minutes every second day </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you could do that?</v>

205
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:20.570
<v Speaker 1>You put it in your schedule like 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes every second day in the morning </v>

206
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:21.030
<v Speaker 1>and that's why you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

207
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

208
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not very good at managing my study </v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule.</v>

209
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.960
<v Speaker 1>That's not quite down here at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral level,</v>

210
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty close because what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can take an action,</v>

211
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:32.700
<v Speaker 1>you can open up your schedule and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>

212
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes away aside.</v>

213
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Then you can practice doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty low level in the hierarchy </v>

214
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 1>means while you're still not a horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

215
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:43.290
<v Speaker 1>you just got to polish up your work </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethic.</v>
