1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Mother made some pancakes for billy </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the dragon,</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>ate the mall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother made some more,</v>

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.020
<v Speaker 1>but the dragon eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two mother kept making pancakes </v>

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>until she ran out of batter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billy only got one of them,</v>

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>but he said that's all he really wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>so I'll tell you another story about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

7
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>So when I lived in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had little kids and uh,</v>

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.060
<v Speaker 1>my wife took care of some neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>little kids because she didn't have a </v>

9
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.460
<v Speaker 1>green card and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was home with the kids anyways.</v>

10
00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>And anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she took care of some other little kids.</v>

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>One of them would only eat hot dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was quite funny.</v>

12
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>You'd only eat hotdogs at his mother's </v>
<v Speaker 1>place booked at our house.</v>

13
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>He ate all of his lunch and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly happy about it.</v>

14
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that was quite amusing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

15
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 1>one day a neighbor came by and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor had a four year old child and </v>

16
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>the neighbor was looking for someone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of the child because her nanny</v>

17
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>had been in a car accident and couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of the child temporarily.</v>

18
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.230
<v Speaker 1>So the child had sort of been </v>
<v Speaker 1>circulating around neighborhood houses </v>

19
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of days and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were taking care of him,</v>

20
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>then he ended up at our house and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was fine.</v>

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.300
<v Speaker 1>And so he's a cute little guy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

22
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.400
<v Speaker 1>the mother came to the door and she said</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

23
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed the boy and he was Kinda like,</v>

24
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>this wasn't very happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

25
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>she said he probably won't eat all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

26
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

27
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:36.291
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a remarkably interesting </v>

28
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:36.291
<v Speaker 1>statement to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put forth as a proposition the first </v>

30
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 1>time we meet your son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like he won't eat all day,</v>

31
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.270
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is not okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not okay and you're going to tell </v>

32
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.201
<v Speaker 1>us that it's okay and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect that we're just going to accept </v>

33
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you think it's okay.</v>

34
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole story.</v>

35
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>You deliver all that information in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>little sentence.</v>

36
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

37
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty damn peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

38
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 1>I believe she was a psychologist too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was quite interesting.</v>

39
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

40
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:07.611
<v Speaker 1>so that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went out to do something and there </v>

41
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:11.271
<v Speaker 1>was four kids playing in the house and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I came back the little guy was in </v>

42
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:14.631
<v Speaker 1>the porch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like wear the boots were at everything </v>

43
00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>and he was sort of standing there like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and I thought,</v>

44
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.600
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good because there's all </v>

45
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.401
<v Speaker 1>these other kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he should've been in there playing </v>

46
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>a lot obviously that that's what a child</v>
<v Speaker 1>is primed to do.</v>

47
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>He should've been in there messing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

48
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:31.191
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a three year old and another four year </v>

49
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:31.191
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should've been in there,</v>

50
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:34.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>causing trouble and having fun and </v>

51
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.540
<v Speaker 1>playing.</v>

52
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 1>But he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was standing in the porch like this </v>

53
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 1>and he wasn't happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't happy.</v>

54
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.930
<v Speaker 1>So I looked at him for a bit and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>poked him a couple of times because I </v>

55
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.930
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>if you're interacting with little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very playful a,</v>

57
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of like puppies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you,</v>

58
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>if you tease them a bit and tickled them</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit,</v>

59
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>then usually even if they're crabby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.910
<v Speaker 1>a smile break out that despite their </v>
<v Speaker 1>best efforts and then they'll sort of </v>

61
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>giggle then maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll try to whack you away and they,</v>

62
00:02:57.421 --> 00:02:57.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

63
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>they go into a play routine and although</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may not know it,</v>

64
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>mammals like us have a place circuit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>

65
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:11.611
<v Speaker 1>So we're intrinsically playful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is partly why we can get along </v>

66
00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:14.401
<v Speaker 1>with dogs because of course dogs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsically playful and most people </v>

67
00:03:14.401 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>know how to play with the dog and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

68
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>when a dog wants to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

69
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Because it sort of puts his paws down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and looks up at you and Sorta grants and</v>

70
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>puts its tail in the air and goes like </v>
<v Speaker 1>dance.</v>

71
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like clue in primate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>it's time to engage in some playing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>you basically know how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even the dog knows how to do that.</v>

74
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>So I'm poking this kid and trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to smile,</v>

75
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>but there's no damn way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:40.711
<v Speaker 1>I'm poking him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just ignoring me like mad and I </v>

77
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:40.711
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good,</v>

78
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:44.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't want your four year </v>

79
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:44.791
<v Speaker 1>old to have learned that you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should,</v>

80
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:49.440
<v Speaker 1>that it's okay to ignore adults or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should ignore adults or that you can</v>

81
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:54.631
<v Speaker 1>ignore adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all bad because the world's full </v>

82
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:57.901
<v Speaker 1>of adults and they know a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they control all the resources and </v>

83
00:03:57.901 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>so you better get along with them.</v>

84
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Plus you're going to end up as an adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>for most of your life.</v>

85
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 1>So if the general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>if the first rule is adults can and </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be ignored,</v>

87
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>then what the hell are you headed for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

88
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.770
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of the reasons that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really useful to made sure the children </v>

89
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 1>respect adults because they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be adults.</v>

90
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.980
<v Speaker 1>So if they don't respect adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course they don't have any </v>

91
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>respect for what they're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why the hell grow up?</v>

92
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>You end up like Peter Pan Because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Peter Parents about,</v>

93
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:32.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Pan Wants to stay at Neverland </v>

94
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>with the lost boys were where there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility because you know,</v>

95
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.690
<v Speaker 1>he looks at the future and only sees his</v>
<v Speaker 1>captain hook a tyrant who's afraid of </v>

96
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.120
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the crocodile,</v>

97
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:45.121
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's chasing him with a clock in its </v>

98
00:04:45.121 --> 00:04:45.121
<v Speaker 1>stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same thing as this dragon.</v>

99
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 1>kids have to respect adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

101
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 1>you're doing them a disservice if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

102
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.400
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>

103
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm poking this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just no damn way.</v>

104
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting anywhere with them and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought this isn't good.</v>

105
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 1>There's something deeply wrong with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid,</v>

106
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.210
<v Speaker 1>so that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we said all the kids down for </v>

107
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.481
<v Speaker 1>lunch and the rule is your damn lunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>and be thankful for it because you think</v>

108
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:12.241
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leonard Cohen wrote this song once </v>

109
00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:12.241
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the song particularly,</v>

110
00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:15.610
<v Speaker 1>but he talked about the homicidal </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitching that goes down in every kitchen</v>

111
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>about who is going to serve and who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to eat.</v>

112
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you haven't encountered </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

113
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>then there's something terribly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

114
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 1>so because a lot of the tension in in </v>
<v Speaker 1>households is domestic tension,</v>

115
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>the tension between husbands and wives </v>
<v Speaker 1>or husbands,</v>

116
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>wives and children.</v>

117
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like just who the hell is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do the domestic duties and how and when </v>

118
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>and the answer can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

119
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.610
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to do them because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>you eat cheetos and popcorn and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

121
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.620
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of your life and that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

122
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:49.621
<v Speaker 1>It's gotten to the point in England </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the domestic situations have </v>

123
00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:53.461
<v Speaker 1>deteriorated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rituals have deteriorated to such a </v>

124
00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:56.041
<v Speaker 1>point that about one slash third of </v>
<v Speaker 1>families no longer have a dining room </v>

125
00:05:56.041 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>table and you can buy precooked hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>boiled eggs.</v>

126
00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

127
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

128
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might ask yourself why the hell </v>

129
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 1>everyone is either fat or has an eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>

130
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:07.860
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason is,</v>

131
00:06:07.861 --> 00:06:12.861
<v Speaker 1>is that the entire domestic routine </v>
<v Speaker 1>around regulating food intake has </v>

132
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:16.931
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a terrible thing for people </v>

133
00:06:16.931 --> 00:06:16.931
<v Speaker 1>because we're social eaters.</v>

134
00:06:16.931 --> 00:06:21.790
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you sit down with a bunch of </v>

135
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>other people at a table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much should you eat?</v>

136
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is you should eat on </v>
<v Speaker 1>average what everyone else eats.</v>

137
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't notice it,</v>

138
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are so wired into.</v>

139
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>We did experiments like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

140
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 1>if you bring on have you bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates who don't know each other</v>

141
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:43.991
<v Speaker 1>into a lab and you give them a snack </v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're doing something like </v>

142
00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 1>watching a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will eat the same number of chips.</v>

143
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.430
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if one of the meets the whole half the </v>

144
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.731
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other real you'd have if one only </v>

145
00:06:54.731 --> 00:06:54.731
<v Speaker 1>has one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other only have one.</v>

146
00:06:54.731 --> 00:06:57.800
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between the food intake </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the dyads was about point eight.</v>

147
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.040
<v Speaker 1>It was staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to be a little higher for </v>

148
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.531
<v Speaker 1>extroverts than for introverts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was remarkably remarkably can </v>

149
00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 1>coordinate and you can understand why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

150
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Because human being shared food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you are not going to be a </v>

151
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 1>popular tribes person if you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 1>30 percent of the food when food is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>short supply,</v>

153
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 1>you better be bloody awake and make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't take more than your share</v>

154
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.250
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fundamental element of human </v>

155
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:24.250
<v Speaker 1>nature to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

156
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 1>and we also regulate our sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>satiety by cues that are external to us.</v>

157
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.720
<v Speaker 1>So regulating our food intake also </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're omnivores,</v>

158
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:35.630
<v Speaker 1>turns out to be a tremendously difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and well,</v>

159
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.640
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to this kid.</v>

160
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.700
<v Speaker 1>So we bring all the kids to the table </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're sitting around in there </v>

161
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 1>having lunch and the rule is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

162
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.940
<v Speaker 1>eat what is in front of you and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleased and happy about it.</v>

163
00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why would that also be a rule?</v>

164
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

165
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 1>put yourself in this position now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'll be in this position.</v>

166
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 1>You're going to cook your damn kids some</v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch and you're going to do that.</v>

167
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

168
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.940
<v Speaker 1>let's calculate it out because I like </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing arithmetic.</v>

169
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it takes you half an hour a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and you do it seven days a week,</v>

170
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 1>but we'll multiply that by three because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's three meals.</v>

171
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:13.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's an hour and a half a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

172
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

173
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Seven times an hour and a half is </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly 10.</v>

174
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.150
<v Speaker 1>So it's 10 hours a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 40 hours a month,</v>

175
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty hours a month is a full work week.</v>

176
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.510
<v Speaker 1>So 40 hours a month times 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 full work weeks,</v>

177
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:28.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

178
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:33.070
<v Speaker 1>That's three full months of 40 hour days</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cooking something for your damn kid.</v>

179
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a lot of time and then you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do that for 18 years.</v>

180
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.100
<v Speaker 1>So then you might ask yourself what sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of response do you need from your child </v>

181
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.120
<v Speaker 1>in order to not feel resentful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable about the fact that you have </v>

182
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.961
<v Speaker 1>to do that for three bloody months this </v>
<v Speaker 1>year and you just have to think about </v>

183
00:08:52.961 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 1>this and this is also why it's necessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know inside yourself.</v>

184
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 1>You carry a monster just like the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside you carries a monster.</v>

185
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Do not think that you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to maintain a healthy attitude </v>

186
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 1>towards your child or towards food or </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards yourself.</v>

187
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:13.040
<v Speaker 1>If all you can muster up for the effort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of cooking and preparing food is the </v>

188
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.151
<v Speaker 1>attitude of a slave and continual </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment from the people that you're </v>

189
00:09:17.151 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>offering food too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

190
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:22.401
<v Speaker 1>who the hell wants that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to teach them miserable </v>

191
00:09:22.401 --> 00:09:25.641
<v Speaker 1>little bladder that he's lucky that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's any food there at all and that </v>

192
00:09:25.641 --> 00:09:29.481
<v Speaker 1>the proper attitude is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really thank you very much mom or thank </v>

193
00:09:29.481 --> 00:09:33.021
<v Speaker 1>you very much dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad that you produce something and </v>

194
00:09:33.021 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be all happy about the fact that</v>

195
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:36.360
<v Speaker 1>you were slaving away in the kitchen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can like your kid.</v>

196
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:37.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

197
00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:39.750
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well everybody likes their kids.</v>

198
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

199
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:43.020
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No that's not true.</v>

200
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>

201
00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:44.860
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.710
<v Speaker 1>you read in the newspaper about someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

203
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being pushed a little bit too far on </v>

204
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:52.470
<v Speaker 1>some day that they're unemployed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hung over and you know,</v>

205
00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:57.471
<v Speaker 1>the relationship is just broken up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do something absolutely brutal to </v>

206
00:09:57.471 --> 00:09:57.471
<v Speaker 1>their child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

207
00:09:57.471 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could anyone do that?</v>

208
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:03.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a lot of history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible interactions between the mother</v>

209
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:08.421
<v Speaker 1>and the child or the father and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child before something like that </v>

210
00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:08.421
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

211
00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:11.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to protect your child </v>

212
00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:13.431
<v Speaker 1>against the beast that's inside you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might want to teach them to treat </v>

213
00:10:13.431 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 1>you with some respect so that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more likely to be a civilized human</v>

214
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:17.340
<v Speaker 1>being around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

215
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.030
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

216
00:10:19.031 --> 00:10:22.620
<v Speaker 1>so this kid sit in there and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn way he's going to eat anything.</v>

217
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:27.300
<v Speaker 1>So we decide we're going to feed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm an expert at because my,</v>

218
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.460
<v Speaker 1>my son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the one who said no all the time,</v>

219
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:32.350
<v Speaker 1>he was the most stubborn little custom </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could possibly imagine.</v>

220
00:10:32.351 --> 00:10:34.800
<v Speaker 1>And one time when he was about nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>months old,</v>

221
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:38.700
<v Speaker 1>he got ahold of the spoon and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was not going to be fat anymore.</v>

222
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's fine.</v>

223
00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

224
00:10:40.171 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like feed yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no kids say they're too damn curious</v>

225
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:49.041
<v Speaker 1>and playful really to feed themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you sit them in a high chair and </v>

226
00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:49.041
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

227
00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:50.880
<v Speaker 1>they fling the food onto the floor </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's pretty cool.</v>

228
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.060
<v Speaker 1>They could watch that over and over in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order they mess around with it or maybe </v>

229
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:56.060
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.850
<v Speaker 1>put some in mum's hair because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting too.</v>

231
00:10:57.851 --> 00:11:02.851
<v Speaker 1>And they have two or three bites and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're not ravenous and then </v>

232
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:05.661
<v Speaker 1>they're much more interested in playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine except that kid does </v>

233
00:11:05.661 --> 00:11:05.661
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>

234
00:11:05.661 --> 00:11:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Then it gets crabby and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whiny and miserable.</v>

235
00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:13.191
<v Speaker 1>And then it just disturbs the mother or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the father and then it won't sleep at </v>

236
00:11:13.191 --> 00:11:13.191
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

237
00:11:13.191 --> 00:11:15.270
<v Speaker 1>that's no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after about three days of that,</v>

238
00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:20.271
<v Speaker 1>I took the spoon back from him and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was not happy about that man trying to </v>

239
00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:21.750
<v Speaker 1>get that little kid to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I got the spoon,</v>

240
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 1>it was like a four hour battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really remarkable.</v>

241
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:26.220
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

242
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:26.800
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

243
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:31.410
<v Speaker 1>a lot of respect for his ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>withstand stubbornness,</v>

244
00:11:31.411 --> 00:11:36.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had learned by that time as a </v>

245
00:11:36.411 --> 00:11:36.411
<v Speaker 1>parent that like if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline your child,</v>

246
00:11:36.411 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an attitude you have to take,</v>

247
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:42.210
<v Speaker 1>which is I am going to win this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't care how stubborn you are,</v>

248
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I am going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because I know I'm going to win,</v>

249
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:46.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get angry.</v>

250
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna out stubborn you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

251
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.020
<v Speaker 1>So I take up some food and put it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of him.</v>

252
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 1>He'd go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a good trick.</v>

253
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:00.440
<v Speaker 1>And so I try to get the food in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his teeth regretted.</v>

254
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 1>So I poke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poke,</v>

255
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 1>poke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poke,</v>

256
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:05.890
<v Speaker 1>poke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after about 10 pokes,</v>

257
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 1>he'd get annoyed and go and I put the </v>
<v Speaker 1>food yet then he tried to spit it out.</v>

258
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:10.900
<v Speaker 1>So I'd hold it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the editing this.</v>

259
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 1>So then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was like three minutes,</v>

260
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we did it with another spoonful</v>

261
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:15.940
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after about,</v>

262
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd say an hour of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife had to leave because it was like</v>

263
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.720
<v Speaker 1>she just couldn't handle it and I bought</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour after this he decided that,</v>

264
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was okayed and then he would let me </v>

265
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.151
<v Speaker 1>feed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like it was brutal and it was </v>

266
00:12:30.151 --> 00:12:30.151
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

267
00:12:30.151 --> 00:12:31.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean little kids are so damn tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:36.690
<v Speaker 1>they're really cute and everything and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're so tough you just can't </v>

269
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:36.690
<v Speaker 1>believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>

270
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 1>So we had this good at the table and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was not going to eat.</v>

271
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 1>So my wife who'd learned these tricks by</v>
<v Speaker 1>this time decided to feed him and he had</v>

272
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:50.551
<v Speaker 1>a lot of sort of nine months old or </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight month old behaviors because you </v>

273
00:12:50.551 --> 00:12:54.841
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids have different strategies of </v>

274
00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:56.521
<v Speaker 1>resistance if they don't want to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and those strategies get more </v>

275
00:12:56.521 --> 00:12:57.190
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated as they get older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

276
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And he had some strategies but they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't sophisticated,</v>

277
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he didn't make jokes or knocked the</v>

278
00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:04.240
<v Speaker 1>spoon away or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or get angry or,</v>

279
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:07.570
<v Speaker 1>or run away or any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did kind of nine months old things,</v>

280
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:11.140
<v Speaker 1>which means he just put his head down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when she put the spoon towards him,</v>

281
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.450
<v Speaker 1>he just covered his head one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

282
00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:18.540
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was interesting because I knew </v>

283
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.051
<v Speaker 1>that his parents had given up feeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>him when he was about eight or nine </v>

284
00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:24.901
<v Speaker 1>months old because those tricks worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why she could come to the </v>

285
00:13:24.901 --> 00:13:24.901
<v Speaker 1>house and say he probably won't eat all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

286
00:13:24.901 --> 00:13:26.740
<v Speaker 1>but that's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which it isn't,</v>

287
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>

288
00:13:30.401 --> 00:13:35.401
<v Speaker 1>So my wife is trying to feed him and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't open his mouth so she pokes him </v>

289
00:13:35.401 --> 00:13:35.490
<v Speaker 1>a bit and sooner or later he gets mad </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

290
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.080
<v Speaker 1>goes and she puts the food in and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

291
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.500
<v Speaker 1>And then she pats him on the head as </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as he swallows it and says,</v>

292
00:13:41.501 --> 00:13:42.790
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being a really good kid.</v>

293
00:13:42.791 --> 00:13:43.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a good job.</v>

294
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:46.660
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's wondering what the hell is going</v>

295
00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:51.661
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was so interesting because </v>

296
00:13:51.661 --> 00:13:51.661
<v Speaker 1>she kept feeding him and he was still </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this,</v>

297
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.700
<v Speaker 1>but as she patted them on the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be doing this and he'd open his </v>

298
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:56.700
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

299
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.020
<v Speaker 1>So it was like there was this weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict between his habitual behavior </v>

300
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:01.720
<v Speaker 1>and this thing that was being </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforced.</v>

301
00:14:01.721 --> 00:14:04.540
<v Speaker 1>So then she put food in and pat him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

302
00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:06.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be kind of happy about that.</v>

303
00:14:06.251 --> 00:14:11.251
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd go back to his routine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then she did that for I think about 20 </v>

304
00:14:11.591 --> 00:14:16.591
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't disruptive like all the other </v>

305
00:14:16.591 --> 00:14:18.391
<v Speaker 1>kids ate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even really notice what was </v>

306
00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:18.391
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

307
00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:18.391
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

308
00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:22.710
<v Speaker 1>but I was watching because I knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>something was up because the stupid </v>

309
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.221
<v Speaker 1>thing that his mother said and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that he wouldn't play and he </v>

310
00:14:26.221 --> 00:14:26.221
<v Speaker 1>ignored me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

311
00:14:26.221 --> 00:14:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some reading not good here,</v>

312
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.410
<v Speaker 1>this dragon here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a big one.</v>

313
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.960
<v Speaker 1>So she feeds him and then he finishes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole bowl.</v>

314
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she says,</v>

315
00:14:36.161 --> 00:14:36.820
<v Speaker 1>you're a good boy.</v>

316
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:41.820
<v Speaker 1>You ate the whole bowl and Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have seen what happened to </v>

317
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:41.820
<v Speaker 1>that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

318
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:42.160
<v Speaker 1>it just about broke my heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really,</v>

319
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.850
<v Speaker 1>like his eyes got big and he smiled and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just like,</v>

320
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.880
<v Speaker 1>he was super thrilled because he'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally accomplished this absolute basic</v>

321
00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:54.770
<v Speaker 1>necessity that he hadn't mastered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>four years.</v>

322
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.980
<v Speaker 1>He finally got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think of all the meals that he went </v>

323
00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 1>through either being ignored or failing </v>
<v Speaker 1>three times a day for like three years,</v>

324
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.200
<v Speaker 1>nothing but failure and bad responses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

325
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.620
<v Speaker 1>he didn't turn light all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought he was a bad kid and then all</v>

326
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:11.580
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden he figured this out and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

327
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:16.620
<v Speaker 1>get a little reward for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like he just lit up and that </v>

328
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.391
<v Speaker 1>whole shell that he had on the that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like using to protect himself when </v>

329
00:15:19.391 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 1>he was in the porch.</v>

330
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.400
<v Speaker 1>That just melted away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

331
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 1>it was horrifying and amazing at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

332
00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:28.610
<v Speaker 1>And then he followed my wife around </v>
<v Speaker 1>after that in the house,</v>

333
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.470
<v Speaker 1>just like a puppy dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he wouldn't get.</v>

334
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.460
<v Speaker 1>He would not get more than one foot away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from her.</v>

335
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:39.850
<v Speaker 1>It was unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we went downstairs to watch </v>

336
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.300
<v Speaker 1>like a movie with the kids and she sat </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a rocking chair and he climbed right </v>

337
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:42.980
<v Speaker 1>up on her lap and grabbed her just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

338
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Harlow monkey grabbed the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

339
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:49.880
<v Speaker 1>the little soft mother instead of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>winery mother for teams like this.</v>

340
00:15:49.881 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 1>And he was like that for like two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't let her go.</v>

341
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:58.810
<v Speaker 1>So then the mother came home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mother came home and she came </v>

342
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 1>downstairs and she looked at what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>

343
00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:05.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when this kid was like glommed onto my </v>

344
00:16:05.471 --> 00:16:06.030
<v Speaker 1>wife and she looked at her and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh supermom.</v>

345
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.720
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took her kid and went home.</v>

346
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you don't think there's a dragon</v>

347
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:11.690
<v Speaker 1>and that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

348
00:16:11.691 --> 00:16:14.450
<v Speaker 1>you are not listening to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not good.</v>

349
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.300
<v Speaker 1>And her response at the end was </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

350
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.390
<v Speaker 1>She should've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

351
00:16:20.391 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 1>how do you get them to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

352
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.480
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is he doing?</v>

353
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hugging you?</v>

354
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:27.170
<v Speaker 1>He never does that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No way man.</v>

355
00:16:27.171 --> 00:16:32.171
<v Speaker 1>She was going to let that piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information in and it's no wonder </v>

356
00:16:32.171 --> 00:16:35.591
<v Speaker 1>because the dragon and that story was </v>
<v Speaker 1>her and it was something she did not </v>

357
00:16:35.591 --> 00:16:39.320
<v Speaker 1>want to admit and she was willing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly willing to sacrifice her child</v>

358
00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:41.720
<v Speaker 1>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to her failure to realize that she could</v>

359
00:16:41.721 --> 00:16:46.721
<v Speaker 1>be a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that meant that the child was the </v>

360
00:16:46.721 --> 00:16:47.720
<v Speaker 1>problem and that's a hell of a thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do to a four year old.</v>

361
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:52.490
<v Speaker 1>So it was not pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really not pleasant.</v>

362
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:58.990
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we probably did damage to the child by </v>

363
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.140
<v Speaker 1>actually getting them to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>good day because we opened up him up to </v>

364
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.660
<v Speaker 1>the possibility that he could behave </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly and be rewarded for that.</v>

365
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.930
<v Speaker 1>And that gave them hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can bloody well be sure that </v>

366
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.080
<v Speaker 1>that hope was dispensed with the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

367
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.520
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

368
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's why bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't get anything to eat.</v>
