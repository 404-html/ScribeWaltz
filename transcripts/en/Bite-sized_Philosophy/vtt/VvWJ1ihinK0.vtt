00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.670
<v Speaker 1>So now some of the problems with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Marxist perspective seems to be</v>

2
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:10.671
<v Speaker 1>that victimhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their sense of enhanced victimhood tends</v>

3
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:15.741
<v Speaker 1>to produce an intense sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and that's a very bad idea </v>

4
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:17.250
<v Speaker 1>because resentment is a very toxic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent emotion.</v>

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 1>It's also very ungrateful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things I would </v>

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.161
<v Speaker 1>really say about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the radical left student </v>

7
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at Ivy League universities.</v>

8
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:30.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really quite a spectacle to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see people at places like Yale come out </v>

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>and agitate as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realization of their own oppression when</v>

10
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>by any reasonable standard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>current or historical,</v>

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.210
<v Speaker 1>they're probably in the top one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100th of a percent at perhaps better </v>

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 1>than that of all the people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever lived anywhere ever.</v>

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>And so it really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really.</v>

14
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>It's really quite staggering to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top point zero,</v>

15
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one percent can express their resentment</v>

16
00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>about the top point zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

17
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:04.221
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one percent in such strident terms </v>

18
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:07.641
<v Speaker 1>without noticing that exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>claims of privilege apply to them by as </v>

19
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 1>long as all you have to do is transform </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

20
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bend in which you're doing the </v>

21
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 1>privilege comparisons and that becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately self evident and you know </v>

22
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>the fact that as Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

23
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>or a North American since I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian,</v>

24
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>that were staggeringly privileged </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to the rest of the world,</v>

25
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:31.731
<v Speaker 1>is certainly a consequence of the of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you might describe as the </v>

26
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>arbitrariness of our political borders </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

27
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:38.571
<v Speaker 1>but to forget that when you're claiming </v>
<v Speaker 1>a particular brand of oppression for </v>

28
00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:42.591
<v Speaker 1>yourself seems to me to be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>ungrateful at the least and certainly </v>

29
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say politically because I think it</v>

30
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:49.971
<v Speaker 1>justifies your expression of hatred for </v>
<v Speaker 1>those tiny fraction of people who are </v>

31
00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>still better off than you.</v>

32
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>And also a degree of historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance.</v>

33
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:58.701
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely staggering in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnitude and a complete indictment of </v>

34
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:02.721
<v Speaker 1>our education system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should be indicted in every </v>

35
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:06.081
<v Speaker 1>possible way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now the Marxists might claim to their</v>

36
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.130
<v Speaker 1>benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say with this worldview of class </v>

37
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:19.161
<v Speaker 1>struggle as being the primary driver of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human history and the well off </v>

38
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomically because that's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much the only way they define well off,</v>

39
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:28.221
<v Speaker 1>which is also something I take great </v>
<v Speaker 1>objection to because there's lots of </v>

40
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:32.240
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies in the world and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>many important hierarchies and not all </v>

41
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.041
<v Speaker 1>of them can be reduced to socioeconomic </v>
<v Speaker 1>status by any stretch of the </v>

42
00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:40.611
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you are 80 years old and you </v>

43
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:40.611
<v Speaker 1>had $20,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>he might be perfectly happy to get rid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all that money if you could be 18 </v>

45
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's.</v>

46
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.241
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best predictors of wealth in </v>

47
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:50.480
<v Speaker 1>North America is actually age because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:53.130
<v Speaker 1>young people haven't actually had much </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to make money,</v>

49
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>whereas old people have had quite a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>

50
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.050
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with being old enriches </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're still old and that actually </v>

51
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>turns out to be quite a serious problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>because no matter how rich you are,</v>

52
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:09.151
<v Speaker 1>you eventually die and so the money is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the money has a very delimited if </v>

53
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>limited effect with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing the fundamental problems of </v>

54
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.261
<v Speaker 1>the suffering of life and we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly well from the empirical </v>

55
00:03:19.261 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>perspective that once you have enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>money so that the bill collectors aren't</v>

56
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:27.301
<v Speaker 1>chasing you around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially something like the </v>

57
00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:30.301
<v Speaker 1>beginnings of a middle class existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe the upper end of the working </v>

58
00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>class than additional money has </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely no bearing whatsoever on your</v>

59
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>psychological wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually an indication of the</v>

60
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 1>limitations of material comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say as a medication for the.</v>

61
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>For the suffering that's attendant on </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

62
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.180
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing that's very weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the Marxists and I think very </v>

63
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.050
<v Speaker 1>interestingly contradictory because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very anti capital in their </v>

64
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.551
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're so damn materialistic that </v>

65
00:03:56.551 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely mind boggling because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Marxists are actually more convinced</v>

66
00:03:57.611 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 1>that money is useful than most </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalists.</v>

67
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.680
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they believe that that money is </v>

68
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>in fact the solution to all life's </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

69
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:10.681
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that just the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't have the money and I think </v>

70
00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a staggeringly naive perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's many,</v>

71
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.480
<v Speaker 1>there's many problems in life that money</v>
<v Speaker 1>just cannot solve and there's a fair </v>

72
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 1>number of them and that it actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes worse.</v>

73
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having said all that,</v>

74
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.780
<v Speaker 1>you could also still make the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to work for a Socialist Party in </v>

75
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Canada when I was a kid about six </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] time.</v>

76
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:34.981
<v Speaker 1>I was 14 till the time I was about 17 </v>
<v Speaker 1>before I figured out what was wrong,</v>

77
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>not so much with socialism per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with ideology per se,</v>

78
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.190
<v Speaker 1>and I actually admired the socialist </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders that I had the fortune to be </v>

79
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.200
<v Speaker 1>introduced to because at that point they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were very much a voice for the working </v>

80
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

81
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 1>A lot of union leaders and people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

82
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're classic Democratic Socialists</v>

83
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:59.761
<v Speaker 1>on the Labor end of the distribution and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely necessary for labor and </v>

84
00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>the working class to have a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>

85
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Something the Democrats might keep in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

86
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.020
<v Speaker 1>So when maybe they wouldn't lose their </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections quite so frequently now,</v>

87
00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I really think it's appalling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>because it's necessary for the working </v>
<v Speaker 1>class to have a political voice.</v>

89
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.280
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to have that transformed into </v>

90
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.280
<v Speaker 1>identity politics is a real catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

91
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that the people that I met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of them were genuinely concerned </v>

92
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 1>with the problems of the working class </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

93
00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:29.731
<v Speaker 1>more power to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think there are people on the </v>

94
00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:32.281
<v Speaker 1>left who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who genuinely are trying to make a </v>

95
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:35.521
<v Speaker 1>difference for people who could use a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fair shot at opportunity in life.</v>

96
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.720
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time I noticed that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous number of the,</v>

97
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.890
<v Speaker 1>of especially the lower and worker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a party worker per protester types were </v>

98
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.130
<v Speaker 1>more peevish and resentful than </v>
<v Speaker 1>goodhearted and kind.</v>

99
00:05:49.131 --> 00:05:54.131
<v Speaker 1>And it was about that time that I came </v>
<v Speaker 1>across George Orwell's famous critique </v>

100
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:58.471
<v Speaker 1>of left wing thinking and in the UK in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>book called road to Wigan Pier,</v>

101
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>where he basically made the claim that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the socialists that he knew,</v>

102
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>especially the middleclass ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't give a damn about the poor.</v>

103
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 1>They just hated the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

104
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is something we're thinking about </v>

105
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.441
<v Speaker 1>for a very long period of time because </v>
<v Speaker 1>hatred actually turns out to be a very </v>

106
00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>powerful motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>and if you think about the sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that happened in the Soviet Union</v>

108
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>and all these places that were supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be workers paradises,</v>

109
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.280
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the outcome and you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to infer whether it was goodness of </v>

110
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.511
<v Speaker 1>heart and kind heartedness and care for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the working man that produced the </v>

111
00:06:31.511 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 1>genocides or outright bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>

112
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 1>resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hatred,</v>

113
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot easier to draw a causal path </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the negative emotion to the </v>

114
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.721
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then from the positive kind hearted </v>

115
00:06:43.721 --> 00:06:46.271
<v Speaker 1>benevolence to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't get gulags out of </v>

116
00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:47.630
<v Speaker 1>benevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not how it works.</v>

117
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>So I think the bloody historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence is clear.</v>

118
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I have read the most </v>

119
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.960
<v Speaker 1>convoluted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological,</v>

120
00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.970
<v Speaker 1>pathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twisted rationalizations of what </v>

121
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.571
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay installing this Russia that you </v>

122
00:07:04.571 --> 00:07:06.701
<v Speaker 1>could possibly manufacture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as if on a stack of corpses that </v>

123
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:12.131
<v Speaker 1>would reach halfway to the moon isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough evidence for the pathology of a </v>

124
00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:16.031
<v Speaker 1>certain form of belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people can't be convinced by </v>

125
00:07:16.031 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 1>anyone's death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their own,</v>

126
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:17.450
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>
