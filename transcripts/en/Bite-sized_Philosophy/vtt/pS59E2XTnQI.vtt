1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.150
<v Speaker 1>This is really an interesting one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2
00:00:02.151 --> 00:00:07.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know what God's doing here </v>

3
00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:10.601
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's helping ignite the sacrificial </v>

4
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:15.041
<v Speaker 1>flame and that's kind of an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea I think because you know,</v>

5
00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you have an impulse to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a sacrifice.</v>

6
00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:20.450
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:22.240
<v Speaker 1>I should change this about my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

8
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.510
<v Speaker 1>What's like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does that come from?</v>

9
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:28.511
<v Speaker 1>That impulse is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well just manifests itself out of </v>

10
00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what order you came up with it,</v>

11
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:34.751
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might want to start thinking about </v>

12
00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:35.780
<v Speaker 1>that thinking so surely that you come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your own thoughts.</v>

13
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:40.781
<v Speaker 1>You don't come up with your damn dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you pay just happened and God only </v>

14
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>knows where they come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come from your brain.</v>

15
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Whoa boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a sophisticated answer that come </v>

16
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>from your unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

17
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 1>that's not much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least it's somewhat better,</v>

18
00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:54.260
<v Speaker 1>but there are those matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing dramas take place in the theater</v>

19
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:59.261
<v Speaker 1>of your imagination at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even understand what they are </v>

20
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Speaker 1>and yet they occur night after night and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>

21
00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can contain wisdom that it just.</v>

22
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just staggers the person who has the </v>

23
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they get the key to the dream,</v>

24
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>once they remembered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

25
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.600
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just revealed a bunch of wisdom to </v>

26
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>yourself that you didn't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where'd that come from?</v>

27
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

28
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.290
<v Speaker 1>How in the world can you dream up things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't know?</v>

29
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we'll talk about that at some </v>

30
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.011
<v Speaker 1>point in this lecture series because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some reasonable things that </v>

31
00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>can be said about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know the idea of that</v>

32
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>there's something that's not you young </v>
<v Speaker 1>would call it the self.</v>

33
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:39.251
<v Speaker 1>Carl Jung would call it the self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he thought of it as the totality </v>

34
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:42.641
<v Speaker 1>of your being across time and space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and that you </v>

35
00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:46.631
<v Speaker 1>know each second that you exist is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slice of the self manifesting itself </v>

36
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>across time and space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he thought of the.</v>

37
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>The self is partly the voice of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience.</v>

38
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that is that helps guide you </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have to make a difficult </v>

39
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.560
<v Speaker 1>decision and a difficult decision might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

40
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I need to sacrifice?</v>

41
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:01.880
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I need to discipline myself,</v>

42
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:04.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I need to forego?</v>

43
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you figure those things out?</v>

44
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.550
<v Speaker 1>we'll just picture is trying to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth the idea that perhaps if you had </v>

46
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.241
<v Speaker 1>established the proper relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>God the father and we've talked about </v>

47
00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 1>what that might mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he would help figure out how to get</v>

48
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:23.861
<v Speaker 1>this sacrificial fires burning so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could stay in a proper relationship </v>

49
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>with him across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:28.070
<v Speaker 1>if that's such an unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition,</v>

51
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the alternative proposition?</v>

52
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't working out very well,</v>

53
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.970
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Kate seems to be doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

55
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:42.941
<v Speaker 1>It's like he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he thinks he can only do it himself </v>

56
00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:43.940
<v Speaker 1>or maybe he wants only to take credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it or something like that,</v>

57
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.260
<v Speaker 1>he's not in this</v>

58
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>grateful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

59
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.160
<v Speaker 1>and inquiring grateful and inquiring </v>
<v Speaker 1>posture because that's what a prayer for</v>

60
00:02:55.831 --> 00:03:00.831
<v Speaker 1>posture should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be grateful and inquiring and </v>

61
00:03:00.831 --> 00:03:03.291
<v Speaker 1>grateful is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank God things aren't worse for me </v>

62
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:06.031
<v Speaker 1>than they are and you should be grateful</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that because they could be a lot </v>

63
00:03:06.031 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>worse than they are and they can be so </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad and inquiring would be,</v>

64
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know how I could make it </v>

65
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.450
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm.</v>

66
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm open to suggestions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

67
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>if I can figure out how to do it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try it.</v>

68
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the humility and the inquiry.</v>

69
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>That's a humble inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could I make things better?</v>

70
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices do I need to make in order to</v>

71
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 1>make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question to ask yourself.</v>

72
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>You could ask yourself that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

73
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>what sacrifice do I have to make to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>things better?</v>

74
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>You can decide what constitutes better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

75
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Then it's not even as if it's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>imposed on you.</v>

76
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Come up with your own notion of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes better.</v>

77
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Try to make it sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should just be better for you because </v>

78
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>that isn't going to work very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

79
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.340
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just gonna fall downstairs.</v>

80
00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.420
<v Speaker 1>If you do that because you have to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>with other people and besides stupid </v>

81
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do like can't even</v>

82
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>just nothing you could even say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

83
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:09.091
<v Speaker 1>It's so that that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the attitude of a very badly </v>

84
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:13.500
<v Speaker 1>behaved hyper aggressive two year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that technically and so you </v>

85
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could ask yourself,</v>

86
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I have this day that lays itself out</v>

87
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:24.781
<v Speaker 1>in front of me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What thing could I let go of that's </v>

88
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>impeding my progress that if I let go of</v>
<v Speaker 1>would make my life better,</v>

89
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 1>my family's life better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my culture's life better,</v>

90
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:36.391
<v Speaker 1>my being better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that would give you something </v>

91
00:04:36.391 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>to do for the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it?</v>

92
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Into a justify your miserable life </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you need that.</v>

93
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole point of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of Adam and eve.</v>

94
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 1>What do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A miserable life?</v>

95
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do about that?</v>

96
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just have a miserable life,</v>

97
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to suffer stupidly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get bitter about it.</v>

98
00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened is to cane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

99
00:04:58.061 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about not doing that?</v>

100
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Because that seems to just take a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal and make it worse.</v>

101
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.890
<v Speaker 1>How about making a sacrifice and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can please God and put being on </v>

102
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 1>track?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

103
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>that'd be something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could be better than that?</v>

104
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.030
<v Speaker 1>What could possibly be better than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

105
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's archetipal band because </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's better than that.</v>

106
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 1>That's where tops out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you can do that,</v>

107
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:30.121
<v Speaker 1>you could do that every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to do it in a little way </v>

108
00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.941
<v Speaker 1>because like what good are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're not going to go and </v>

109
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 1>bring this socialist utopia in to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>in one fell swoop.</v>

110
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.090
<v Speaker 1>You might also think that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things came might figure out here.</v>

111
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of things that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't going right for him,</v>

112
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>downwind of the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the right place to blow from and the</v>

113
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:05.771
<v Speaker 1>fact that he's in hidden valley in Hays </v>
<v Speaker 1>and smoke and breathing it in and the </v>

114
00:06:05.771 --> 00:06:10.121
<v Speaker 1>fire isn't burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might be an indication that he's doing </v>

115
00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>something wrong or he could be wiping </v>
<v Speaker 1>his eyes and say,</v>

116
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of stupid bloody universe </v>

117
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.710
<v Speaker 1>would produce smoke like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

118
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the more likely outcome,</v>

119
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.300
<v Speaker 1>and the Lord said unto Cain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why Art Thou wroth and why is they </v>

120
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.231
<v Speaker 1>countenance fallen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Thou knewest well Shalt Thou not be </v>

121
00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:36.690
<v Speaker 1>accepted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's an interesting line because,</v>

122
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.660
<v Speaker 1>and I've looked at a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different translations of.</v>

123
00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:43.290
<v Speaker 1>This is seventh verse here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bunch of them,</v>

124
00:06:43.291 --> 00:06:48.291
<v Speaker 1>because the translation for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a critical line and the </v>

125
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:52.611
<v Speaker 1>translation really matters and so I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you what I think the story is what </v>

126
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:55.080
<v Speaker 1>I've been able to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure I haven't got it completely</v>

127
00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:59.370
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so he asks,</v>

128
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.680
<v Speaker 1>God says to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do well,</v>

129
00:07:01.681 --> 00:07:04.110
<v Speaker 1>won't you be accepted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does the hint there?</v>

130
00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like,</v>

131
00:07:05.581 --> 00:07:07.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things aren't going so well for you,</v>

132
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.540
<v Speaker 1>so the first thing you might think is</v>

133
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.650
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

134
00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:18.651
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean you're not acting </v>

135
00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:21.441
<v Speaker 1>properly means it's the hint because God</v>
<v Speaker 1>is suggesting that if you are doing it </v>

136
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.770
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would be successful.</v>

137
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend at one point who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very bitter person and he had a bunch of</v>

138
00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:36.570
<v Speaker 1>problems and some of them were self </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflicted in some of them were fate,</v>

139
00:07:36.571 --> 00:07:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that he had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

140
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.010
<v Speaker 1>he had become very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very destructive,</v>

141
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.390
<v Speaker 1>murderously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive,</v>

142
00:07:42.391 --> 00:07:44.280
<v Speaker 1>genocidally destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

143
00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:49.281
<v Speaker 1>You could see it in his dreams and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he lived with me for awhile and I </v>

144
00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:56.261
<v Speaker 1>knew him very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a friend of mine from the time I </v>

145
00:07:56.261 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Speaker 1>was 12 until the time he committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide when he was about 40 and a</v>

146
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.380
<v Speaker 1>when he lived with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to help him get on his </v>

147
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.571
<v Speaker 1>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was why he had come to live with </v>

148
00:08:06.571 --> 00:08:08.401
<v Speaker 1>me because he thought maybe I could help</v>
<v Speaker 1>him get on his feet and he could only </v>

149
00:08:08.401 --> 00:08:10.960
<v Speaker 1>take relatively low level jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

150
00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:13.060
<v Speaker 1>like he had some mechanical ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

151
00:08:13.061 --> 00:08:14.520
<v Speaker 1>he didn't get educated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although he's a very,</v>

152
00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:19.521
<v Speaker 1>very smart person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably had an Iq of about 135 or </v>

153
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:20.110
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart and so he was bitter too</v>

154
00:08:20.111 --> 00:08:22.800
<v Speaker 1>because he hadn't educated themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the level that his,</v>

155
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his intellectual,</v>

156
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.410
<v Speaker 1>abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had to take jobs that were beneath</v>

157
00:08:26.411 --> 00:08:29.980
<v Speaker 1>him intellectually and he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had that real intellectual arrogance,</v>

158
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:34.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was smart and really smart </v>

159
00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.711
<v Speaker 1>people often come to believe that only </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart matters and if they're smart and </v>

160
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:43.471
<v Speaker 1>all that and all it matters is smart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the world isn't sort of laying </v>

161
00:08:43.471 --> 00:08:46.200
<v Speaker 1>itself at their feet than they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly betrayed and,</v>

162
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.880
<v Speaker 1>and then they cling to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

163
00:08:48.881 --> 00:08:50.680
<v Speaker 1>which is more like a talent or a gift.</v>

164
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's an idol,</v>

165
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:53.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a false idol,</v>

166
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:58.981
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what it in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous one and get cynical about the </v>

167
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:03.801
<v Speaker 1>stupidity of the world and the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>their are talents weren't properly </v>

168
00:09:03.801 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>recognized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just not that helpful because</v>

169
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 1>smart is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you,</v>

170
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 1>if you don't use it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will devour you.</v>

171
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Just like all arbitrarily assigned </v>
<v Speaker 1>talent.</v>

172
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might have a talent,</v>

173
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:16.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's your friend if you use it </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

174
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 1>And you misuse it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be your enemy,</v>

175
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's how God keeps the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmic scales adjusted.</v>

176
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 1>But anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend was a very smart person,</v>

177
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 1>although not as smart as he thought he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was unfortunately,</v>

178
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:33.321
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he hadn't done what would have been </v>

179
00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:36.081
<v Speaker 1>necessary with that intelligence to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it manifest itself properly in the </v>

180
00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:40.251
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that also embittered him because he </v>

181
00:09:40.251 --> 00:09:42.150
<v Speaker 1>also knew that there was more that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have done if he would have done it</v>

182
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.360
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps more that he could still do </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I was suggesting to him while he </v>

183
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.110
<v Speaker 1>was living with us because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

184
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.040
<v Speaker 1>two levels from homeless by that point </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that he should find a job that he </v>

185
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 1>could find working in a garage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working in a shop,</v>

186
00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:03.201
<v Speaker 1>something like that because he had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical ability and that he should </v>

187
00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:03.201
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

188
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.720
<v Speaker 1>He should separate himself from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogance that made him presumed that </v>

189
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.011
<v Speaker 1>such a job would be beneath him because </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that point no job was beneath him.</v>

190
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:15.150
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>

191
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not so obvious that jobs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneath people,</v>

192
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because even if you're a,</v>

193
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 1>even if you imagine you have a job as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>checkout person in a,</v>

194
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.400
<v Speaker 1>in a grocery store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:31.920
<v Speaker 1>as a fairly unskilled job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be some miserable,</v>

196
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:34.590
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrid bastard doing that job.</v>

197
00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

198
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:40.401
<v Speaker 1>you can come in there just exuding </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and bitterness and making </v>

199
00:10:40.401 --> 00:10:44.300
<v Speaker 1>mistakes and making sure that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>customer that passes by you has a </v>

200
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 1>slightly worse day than they need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write.</v>

201
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.710
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

202
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.820
<v Speaker 1>pilfering time and perhaps pilfering </v>
<v Speaker 1>goods and being resentful about the </v>

203
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.471
<v Speaker 1>people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gave you the position because </v>

204
00:10:57.471 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 1>they're above you in the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and talking,</v>

205
00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad things.</v>

206
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Gossiping behind the back of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>coworkers is like,</v>

207
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.640
<v Speaker 1>you can take your menial position self </v>
<v Speaker 1>described and turn that into a very nice</v>

208
00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:09.780
<v Speaker 1>little slice of hell.</v>
