1
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.240
<v Speaker 1>And with regards with regards to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>

2
00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:09.241
<v Speaker 1>I thought at one point that the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do would be to cut their </v>

3
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:11.761
<v Speaker 1>funding by 25 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them fight amongst themselves for </v>

4
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.791
<v Speaker 1>the remnants because it would force the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities to decide exactly what's </v>

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:18.391
<v Speaker 1>important and what isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say the humanities and much </v>

6
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:21.541
<v Speaker 1>of the social sciences have has turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a postmodern Neil Marxist </v>

7
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:23.260
<v Speaker 1>playground for radicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scholarship is terrible.</v>

8
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Eighty percent of humanities papers </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't cited once,</v>

9
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that they </v>

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.141
<v Speaker 1>write papers for each other and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell them to libraries and that's how </v>

11
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:34.330
<v Speaker 1>the publishers make their money and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one reads them.</v>

12
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:39.331
<v Speaker 1>But the publishers can print them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the libraries have to buy them </v>

13
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:39.331
<v Speaker 1>and they're buying them with your tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

14
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>And so all of you who are sitting here </v>
<v Speaker 1>are funding and postmodern radical neo </v>

15
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:49.711
<v Speaker 1>Marxist agenda that has its roots in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university and your tax money is going </v>

16
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:50.620
<v Speaker 1>towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want proof of that,</v>

17
00:00:50.621 --> 00:00:53.140
<v Speaker 1>you just go online and look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>websites,</v>

18
00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 1>especially of of disciplines like </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's studies,</v>

19
00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>which has pathological right to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>core,</v>

20
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just women's studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all the ethnic studies group</v>

21
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.580
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

22
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>It's anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sociology,</v>

23
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>it's social work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of all it's education and </v>

24
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>noisy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

25
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>in Ontario is perhaps a part from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Human Rights Commission,</v>

26
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>the most dangerous institution in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>

27
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should</v>

28
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.570
<v Speaker 1>be defunded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that.</v>

29
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.670
<v Speaker 1>They don't do the research they purport </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

30
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:28.760
<v Speaker 1>They're not interested in it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In education.</v>

31
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>They're interested in the indoctrination</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people as young as they can fund a as</v>

32
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:35.720
<v Speaker 1>young as they can get their hands on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

33
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Now we need to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our society needs to figure out how to </v>

34
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.760
<v Speaker 1>stop shunting public tax money to </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical left wing activists.</v>

35
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Speaker 1>If we were doing that for radical right </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing activists,</v>

36
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:51.041
<v Speaker 1>there would be an absolute storm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's happened incrementally since </v>

37
00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:51.680
<v Speaker 1>the 19 sixties and it needs to stop.</v>
