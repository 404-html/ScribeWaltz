1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you have oriented yourself </v>

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.850
<v Speaker 1>but not perfectly because you're full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes and errors,</v>

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.720
<v Speaker 1>so then what do you do because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fix those errors but you still have </v>

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.720
<v Speaker 1>to be oriented</v>

5
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.530
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I started getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested to get interested in the </v>

6
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.351
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon of meaning as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a phenomenological experience to </v>

7
00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:26.510
<v Speaker 1>experience something as meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly obvious what that means</v>

8
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 1>to experience something as meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that you can,</v>

9
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.880
<v Speaker 1>you can approach it obliquely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:36.881
<v Speaker 1>like if I said watch yourself for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks and notice when you're doing </v>

11
00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:37.910
<v Speaker 1>something that you regard as meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say,</v>

12
00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 1>well here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some,</v>

13
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.680
<v Speaker 1>here's some markers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lose a sense of time.</v>

14
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>You lose a sense of vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're deeply engaged in it.</v>

15
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.380
<v Speaker 1>It seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems worth the effort,</v>

16
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You forget yourself while you're doing </v>

17
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.421
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you forget your existential </v>

18
00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:58.031
<v Speaker 1>concerns while you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not ruminating or obsessing about</v>

19
00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:00.350
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

20
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's markers for,</v>

21
00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 1>it's like the flow states that chicks at</v>
<v Speaker 1>my highly described.</v>

22
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.610
<v Speaker 1>and then you can experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You experienced it under a certain sort </v>

24
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.641
<v Speaker 1>of ritualistic conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might experience it when you go see </v>

25
00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:19.221
<v Speaker 1>a great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might experience it when you listen </v>

26
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:19.221
<v Speaker 1>to music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think music is a very,</v>

27
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:23.151
<v Speaker 1>very standard pathway for people to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of experience because </v>

28
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.160
<v Speaker 1>virtually everyone gets intimations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mute of meaning from music and I think </v>

29
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:33.351
<v Speaker 1>music music is hierarchically structured</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns that are representative of </v>

30
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>being laying itself out properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>

31
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:42.861
<v Speaker 1>so it's an abstract representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper being and so we can.</v>

32
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>We can grapple with the phenomena of </v>
<v Speaker 1>music and we can.</v>

33
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>We can bark or phenomena meaning we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>box it in a little bit and start to </v>

34
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.961
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can start to conceptualize it perhaps</v>

35
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:59.561
<v Speaker 1>as the manifestation of a deep instinct </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I would say well meaning is what </v>

36
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:03.800
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself when you are,</v>

37
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.570
<v Speaker 1>when you've oriented yourself properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you've optimized the flow of </v>

38
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>information between you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you between you and chaos.</v>

39
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker 1>That might be the right way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because you think about a piece</v>

40
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:22.670
<v Speaker 1>of music because you want it to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable,</v>

41
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.370
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want it to be perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable.</v>

42
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:30.371
<v Speaker 1>You want to be it to be predictable with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some interesting variations and </v>

43
00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:33.610
<v Speaker 1>predictable with some variations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense and maybe you can </v>

44
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.610
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize that as something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

45
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's predictable that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>order of of stability,</v>

46
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's varying down here from time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and so you've got stable stability </v>

47
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:45.860
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but variability there and you can handle</v>

48
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:47.330
<v Speaker 1>that so you want</v>

49
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 1>an overarching structure stability with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some internal variability and maybe </v>

50
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.000
<v Speaker 1>that's the way that you update yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>without falling apart.</v>

51
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say you can find the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway,</v>

52
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.200
<v Speaker 1>the up optimal rate of update by relying</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your sense of meaning.</v>

53
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it tells you is that you're.</v>

54
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.970
<v Speaker 1>You're wandering your way through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world between the catastrophes of chaos </v>

55
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 1>in the catastrophes of order and now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you swing into the proper locale.</v>

56
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>You're where you should be and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens is you get engaged by that.</v>

57
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>You can meaningfully engaged by that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fragile.</v>

58
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 1>It'll move on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Because it's very difficult to exist at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point constantly.</v>

60
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Your bad habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things.</v>

61
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:38.611
<v Speaker 1>Your situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of things that are </v>

62
00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:40.531
<v Speaker 1>going to interfere with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that that isn't </v>

63
00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>where you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then you might say,</v>

64
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you should strive to be all</v>

65
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the question might be,</v>

66
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:50.881
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would it be like if you were there </v>

67
00:03:50.881 --> 00:03:50.881
<v Speaker 1>all the time?</v>

68
00:03:50.881 --> 00:03:54.330
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's where intimations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise come from mean when words think</v>

69
00:03:55.941 --> 00:04:00.941
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wordsworth talked about intimations of </v>

70
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.031
<v Speaker 1>immortality and childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People tend to romanticize their </v>

71
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:05.881
<v Speaker 1>childhood because of the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense engagement that goes along with </v>

72
00:04:05.881 --> 00:04:10.621
<v Speaker 1>being a child and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful things about being around </v>

73
00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:10.621
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

74
00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:10.621
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

75
00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:15.030
<v Speaker 1>it's what they pay you for their care </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way that children pay you for </v>

76
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:20.251
<v Speaker 1>their care is that they turn normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>things into magic again when you're </v>

77
00:04:20.251 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>around them because you've seen it 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>times before and so when you see it,</v>

78
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 1>you don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see what you already know,</v>

79
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 1>but when a child sees that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't know,</v>

80
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 1>they see it and then when you watch them</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it,</v>

81
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.150
<v Speaker 1>you see it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's just,</v>

82
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:39.151
<v Speaker 1>it's tremendous fun leading a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>child around to do things that you've </v>

83
00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 1>done before because they're so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>they're like this.</v>

85
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.140
<v Speaker 1>They're like all the time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's too much.</v>

86
00:04:45.141 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Then they cry and they get upset and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

87
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:51.991
<v Speaker 1>but a good part of the time it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>wild eyed wonder and then you can see </v>

88
00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 1>the world through their eyes and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>payment.</v>

89
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>And so that's that sense of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged.</v>

90
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Like that is something that people love </v>
<v Speaker 1>about children and and rightly so,</v>

91
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a marker to the proper way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being.</v>

92
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

93
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a dictum in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a union idea that there's no </v>

94
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.900
<v Speaker 1>difference between the archetype of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wise old man and the archetype of the </v>

95
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.841
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the same thing because the wise </v>

96
00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>old man is the person who found what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had in childhood but lost.</v>

97
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a that's a very powerful moment.</v>

98
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Teeth is that the purpose of maturation </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to return to this state of childhood </v>

99
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>as a mature B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to stay in the state of childhood,</v>

100
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:32.050
<v Speaker 1>that's Peter Pan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to make the sacrifices necessary for</v>

101
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>maturation and then return so well.</v>

102
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

103
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.310
<v Speaker 1>you do that in part by noting what it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's meaningful for you to engage in.</v>

104
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.990
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's your nervous system </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporting to you,</v>

105
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>right hemisphere and left hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced.</v>

106
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.920
<v Speaker 1>The balance between chaos and order </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces an output that says you are in </v>

107
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 1>the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a perception.</v>

108
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>The meaning is a perception of being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right place.</v>

109
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>It's the genuine thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

110
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.760
<v Speaker 1>because it can be pathologized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing and that's why I think </v>

111
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 1>there is a call to virtue in most great </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious traditions.</v>

112
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to rely on your sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to Orient you,</v>

113
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.500
<v Speaker 1>you have to play a straight game because</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you warp and twist the inputs </v>

114
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>and then the mechanism won't function </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

115
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you.</v>

116
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 1>If you were only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

117
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 1>if you blinded yourself to half the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

118
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:28.991
<v Speaker 1>you can't use your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orient yourself properly because the </v>

119
00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:32.231
<v Speaker 1>half of the world that you're ignoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to pop up at you unexpectedly </v>

120
00:06:32.231 --> 00:06:35.561
<v Speaker 1>and take you down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if your relationship with the </v>

121
00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 1>world isn't pristine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest,</v>

122
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 1>primarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can't rely on your own internal</v>

123
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>orienting mechanisms and then you either</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall into chaos,</v>

124
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:47.351
<v Speaker 1>which is an absolute catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you have to rely on some kind of </v>

125
00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:50.261
<v Speaker 1>external authority and that makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>prone to possession by tyrannical </v>

126
00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 1>etiologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

127
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Which gives you that sense of meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should in fact have as a </v>

128
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>consequence of your own action.</v>
