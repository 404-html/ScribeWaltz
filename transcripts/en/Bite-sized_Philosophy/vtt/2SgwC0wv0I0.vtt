00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2
00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:03.850
<v Speaker 1>I see that it's a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>continual adjective,</v>

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.800
<v Speaker 1>agitation by I would say a minority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left,</v>

4
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.820
<v Speaker 1>the radical left in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are people who aren't Marxist </v>

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Slash Neo Marxist in their fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological orientation and have joined </v>

6
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.041
<v Speaker 1>that in an unholy union with the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>of French postmodernism and and they,</v>

7
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>they push it forward ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainty and the thing that,</v>

8
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's really distressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that is that if you know anything </v>

9
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.470
<v Speaker 1>about the history of oppressed people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

10
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 1>much as I hate to engage in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular form of dialogue under the </v>

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>current conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty obvious that it's freedom of</v>

12
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>speech is freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's particularly important for people</v>

13
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:47.240
<v Speaker 1>who don't have anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:48.930
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're supporting freedom of speech,</v>

15
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:50.970
<v Speaker 1>you're not supporting the status quo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

16
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>just think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

17
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>let's use the logic of the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>leftists and assume that society is a </v>

18
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical hierarchy and the people at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top have the upper hand in </v>

19
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including access to communication.</v>

20
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>These people are not your friends.</v>

21
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's mark my words.</v>

22
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Now it's the sounds of the barbarians </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounding at the gates.</v>

23
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

24
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you again to use it in Kuwait,</v>

25
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it in Kuwait?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sensation is the best formulation of </v>

26
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.970
<v Speaker 1>their argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's not much difference between </v>

27
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:58.010
<v Speaker 1>knocking on the doors and knocking on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

28
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.120
<v Speaker 1>So keep that in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a music,</v>

29
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.460
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing for it.</v>

30
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I think that's also quite appalling is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is no evidence whatsoever </v>

31
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.811
<v Speaker 1>that the people who are conducting these</v>
<v Speaker 1>protests know what it is that they're </v>

32
00:02:13.811 --> 00:02:14.530
<v Speaker 1>protesting against in a way was in.</v>

33
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright.</v>

34
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.940
<v Speaker 1>I was in the midst of a discussion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to make the case that it's </v>

35
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

36
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>That is what people who have nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>still have.</v>

37
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the tyrannical </v>

38
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.601
<v Speaker 1>structure of our society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the people at the top have </v>

39
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:44.901
<v Speaker 1>access to means of communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows that it's the people at </v>

40
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 1>the bottom who have the right to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they think,</v>

41
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 1>however badly they say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It enables them to get a toe hold into </v>

42
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>the system and to and to make their </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering known.</v>

43
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>That's what freedom of speech is for and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like what's the protest against that,</v>

44
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:04.561
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that the rowdy called Neo </v>

45
00:03:04.561 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Marxist types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They speak the language of power and </v>

46
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're speaking right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to live in a world where</v>

47
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>everyone speaks the language of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then just let them do what they're doing</v>

48
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend it.</v>

49
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not a pretty rote and you're all in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a position.</v>

50
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:23.281
<v Speaker 1>You're on a situation in your life now </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you have to make decisions about </v>

51
00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:26.401
<v Speaker 1>this sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is this the sort of institution </v>

52
00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:26.401
<v Speaker 1>that you want this to be.</v>
