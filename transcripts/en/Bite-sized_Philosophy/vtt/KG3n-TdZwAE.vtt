00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.650
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you fall into a chaotic state and </v>

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.491
<v Speaker 1>everything falls apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the possibility that</v>

3
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.830
<v Speaker 1>things can come back together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including what you've just learned in a </v>

4
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:24.521
<v Speaker 1>new state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you can conceptualize that </v>

5
00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:27.671
<v Speaker 1>symbolically as the existence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead father at the bottom of the,</v>

6
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>of the chaotic landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

7
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the proper way as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell to think about it.</v>

8
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's something down there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's capable of reforming and </v>

9
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.931
<v Speaker 1>reemerging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it incorporates the previous </v>

10
00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:46.250
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that takes it farther and you're not</v>

11
00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:51.251
<v Speaker 1>going to find that unless you descend </v>
<v Speaker 1>into this chaotic place where it feels </v>

12
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.600
<v Speaker 1>like all order is gone while you </v>
<v Speaker 1>generate order.</v>

13
00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:55.820
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be akin to the order that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had before,</v>

14
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:57.650
<v Speaker 1>but there's going to be something new </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it as well,</v>

15
00:00:57.651 --> 00:01:02.651
<v Speaker 1>so it's down to the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic state to bring up what you're </v>

16
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:06.410
<v Speaker 1>missing and that's one level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

17
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Another level of analysis you think is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

18
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:09.140
<v Speaker 1>that's also what you're doing.</v>

19
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what you should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In principle,</v>

20
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:15.310
<v Speaker 1>when you're going to university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

21
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>you come to university in roughly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same status.</v>

22
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

23
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker 1>you're a bit of a puppet and you're kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a jackass and what the hell do you </v>

24
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.351
<v Speaker 1>know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's chaotic because you haven't </v>

25
00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>found your place in the world properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean merely for career,</v>

26
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.410
<v Speaker 1>not that that's not relevant because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

27
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's more important than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because you're a historical </v>

28
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.890
<v Speaker 1>creature because you are a product of </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

29
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Unless you are inculturated properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you understand your past and</v>

30
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:50.870
<v Speaker 1>in the sense that the humanities can </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow for that,</v>

31
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 1>then</v>

32
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>you haven't been able to incorporate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom of your ancestors into your day </v>

33
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:02.290
<v Speaker 1>to day pursuits and that's gonna make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you weak.</v>

34
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.730
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

35
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.710
<v Speaker 1>and so when you come to university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what universities for it so that</v>

36
00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:13.711
<v Speaker 1>you can go into the chaos and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull something out of it.</v>

37
00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:18.040
<v Speaker 1>That's truly a value and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate that in your own personality</v>

38
00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:20.800
<v Speaker 1>and that makes you much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much stronger,</v>

39
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.880
<v Speaker 1>like literally stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not more educated but not.</v>

40
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you know more facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that you literally are a better </v>

41
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.080
<v Speaker 1>person and better means you can do far </v>
<v Speaker 1>more things.</v>

42
00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:37.081
<v Speaker 1>You can articulate your that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that's of crucial </v>

43
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:37.210
<v Speaker 1>importance is that you can articulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself properly,</v>

44
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>which is more useful than anything else </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could possibly manage.</v>

45
00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:46.171
<v Speaker 1>Like if you guys come out of university </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of making coherent arguments and</v>

46
00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 1>using language properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so powerful that it's ridiculous.</v>

47
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.100
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always,</v>

48
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.380
<v Speaker 1>you can lay out a strategy and pursue it</v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully and maybe the strategy is </v>

49
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>actually oriented towards something </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

50
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:07.261
<v Speaker 1>Something that will actually work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work for you and work for other people </v>

51
00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't really understand why people</v>

52
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.590
<v Speaker 1>aren't taught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>told this when they come to university,</v>

53
00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:15.591
<v Speaker 1>is that your goal is to make yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate in writing and thinking and </v>

54
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:23.071
<v Speaker 1>speaking as you possibly can because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that opens the door to everything that </v>

55
00:03:23.071 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>you'll want to do in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what it is,</v>

56
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.290
<v Speaker 1>the more articulate person always rises </v>
<v Speaker 1>always because they lay out strategies </v>

57
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:41.131
<v Speaker 1>more effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lay out the reasons for doing </v>

58
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>something or for not doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>more particularly.</v>

59
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:47.341
<v Speaker 1>They convinced people and properly so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can grapple with potentials </v>

60
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.570
<v Speaker 1>that lies ahead effectively and they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>defend themselves when they're </v>

61
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:59.791
<v Speaker 1>challenged and so all of that is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the past,</v>

62
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.180
<v Speaker 1>into the chaos of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could even say and pulling up the </v>

63
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>spirit that inhabits that from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom and uniting with it,</v>

64
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't do that well,</v>

65
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.740
<v Speaker 1>you're defenseless in the case of in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>face of the tragedy of life and and then</v>

66
00:04:20.871 --> 00:04:25.871
<v Speaker 1>then that's not so good because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're defenseless in the face of the </v>

67
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:29.271
<v Speaker 1>tragedy of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get way more hurt than you </v>

68
00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:32.241
<v Speaker 1>would otherwise get and sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people around you and then the </v>

69
00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:35.271
<v Speaker 1>probability that you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and bitter about that is </v>

70
00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:38.301
<v Speaker 1>really hard because no one likes to fail</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually and then you get bitter and </v>

71
00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:42.330
<v Speaker 1>resentful and then once you're bitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and resentful,</v>

72
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>well being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being vengeful in mean is the next step.</v>

73
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.630
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't take much of a transformation</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move you from that place to the next.</v>
