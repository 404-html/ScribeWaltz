00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>the right wing is really hard on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankfurt school,</v>

3
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:10.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Frankfurt school where these </v>

4
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:11.721
<v Speaker 1>kinds of neo Marxist guys who combined </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxism with Friday and Islam in the 19 </v>

5
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:16.960
<v Speaker 1>forties and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were avowed neo Marxists,</v>

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like I'm making an </v>

7
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>accusation and they were kind of anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>system type people and,</v>

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.280
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think to lay what's happening at </v>

9
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.311
<v Speaker 1>the universities and in brought out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the broader culture itself at the feet </v>

10
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:35.511
<v Speaker 1>of the Frankfurt school is insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think that it's primarily a </v>

11
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the French intellectuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

12
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.950
<v Speaker 1>and this is obviously an </v>
<v Speaker 1>oversimplification who emerged out of </v>

13
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Marxism in the early 19 seventies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce postmodernism.</v>

14
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing about the postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 1>types is there nested inside Marxism.</v>

15
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.240
<v Speaker 1>They say that straight out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not inventing this reed Darragh </v>

16
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>who's like the joker at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the head of the postmodernist </v>

17
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

18
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>And I mean joker because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

19
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.140
<v Speaker 1>he's an intellectual clown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean he's stupid </v>

20
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>because he is not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

21
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>These people are not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know exactly what they're doing,</v>

22
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:16.701
<v Speaker 1>they know precisely what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a hell of a lot more educated </v>

23
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>about what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you are less.</v>

24
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>You happen to be one of them and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean exactly what they say,</v>

25
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.070
<v Speaker 1>just like people always do when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you what they're going to do or </v>

26
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>they write it down and they say straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>out on their websites,</v>

27
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>say that women's studies websites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think the patriarchy is an oppressive</v>

28
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.740
<v Speaker 1>structure that should be broken down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>its core and they mean core conceptions.</v>

29
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not just social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's linguistic,</v>

30
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>philosophical and attitudinal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be broken down,</v>

31
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.820
<v Speaker 1>was wiped out and restructured from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom up and they mean that.</v>

32
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.250
<v Speaker 1>So when it's not accidental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any of this,</v>

33
00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>and I know it sounds like a bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid conspiracy theory,</v>

34
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've.</v>

35
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>I've always been of the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially from reading young ideas.</v>

36
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>People don't have ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ideas have people,</v>

37
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.080
<v Speaker 1>and these are powerful ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a good book called explaining </v>

38
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.021
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism that I might recommend by </v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy named named Steven RC Hicks and </v>

39
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 1>his first chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't very long as a good </v>

40
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>introduction to political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so well.</v>

41
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>So why do I think this is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that?</v>

42
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

43
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Here's my reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

44
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem to be about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all I did actually was actually.</v>

45
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I made the general specific k,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of what you have to do if </v>

46
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>you really want to make a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a point,</v>

47
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one place.</v>

48
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:45.021
<v Speaker 1>If you want to make a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my point was I'm not saying made up </v>

49
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:48.951
<v Speaker 1>words generated by postmodern Neil </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxists because I despise everything </v>

50
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:54.130
<v Speaker 1>they stand for and so I'm not using </v>
<v Speaker 1>those damn words and that's that.</v>
