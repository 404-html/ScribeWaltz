1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.650
<v Speaker 1>there's this play written by a German </v>
<v Speaker 1>named good though I can never say that </v>

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Johan van g o e t h e,</v>

4
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:13.971
<v Speaker 1>and I can't say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wrote this play called Faust and </v>

5
00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:18.080
<v Speaker 1>he wrote one part of it when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite young and then files to when he </v>

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Speaker 1>was quite old and he has a character in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

7
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:23.421
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles Mephistopheles the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he actually has the devil explained </v>

8
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>himself twice basically using the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

9
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I really like.</v>

10
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.390
<v Speaker 1>It was very profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically girth is memphis awfully </v>

11
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>says no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the adversary of the word.</v>

12
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of putting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>because that's how it works out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mythologically,</v>

14
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>he's the figure behind the snake in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden of Eden,</v>

15
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>which is something we'll talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

16
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>but he has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a sophisticated philosophy.</v>

17
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:50.180
<v Speaker 1>He's not just some random troublemaker.</v>

18
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>He's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a deep philosophy.</v>

19
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>And his philosophy is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward and it's compelling.</v>

20
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>It's compelling and people are gripped </v>
<v Speaker 1>by it quite often,</v>

21
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>far more often than they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his philosophy is,</v>

22
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look around at the world.</v>

23
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like I then Karamozov in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers Karamazov when he's trying to </v>

24
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.660
<v Speaker 1>disabuse his younger brother of being a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

25
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>a Christian monk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles says,</v>

26
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the world.</v>

27
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you look around the world,</v>

28
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing but a blood bath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just suffering everywhere.</v>

29
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:24.891
<v Speaker 1>Everything eats everything and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>die terribly and they're cruel to one </v>

30
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:29.151
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the whole mass is nothing but a </v>

31
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>constant hall of terrible carnage and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ruin.</v>

32
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:31.870
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

33
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

34
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rec.</v>

35
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.130
<v Speaker 1>He says it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should it be better if it was never </v>

36
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>existed at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very interesting.</v>

37
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting idea.</v>

38
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen this in people many times,</v>

39
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:50.610
<v Speaker 1>that in the depths of despair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you've been betrayed,</v>

40
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:55.611
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you wander into the wrong </v>

41
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:57.831
<v Speaker 1>subdivision of the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that comes to mind if </v>

42
00:01:57.831 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>you know you have a very sick child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

43
00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 1>or maybe your whole family is suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>as whole families do.</v>

44
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes an idea is going to come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

45
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:08.571
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good God who put this message together </v>

46
00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>and is it really worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it really worth this suffering?</v>

47
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Suicidal people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

48
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>They say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say no enough of this.</v>

49
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to be pushed along way.</v>

50
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking before you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually commit suicide.</v>

51
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>You have to be in very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very desperate straits,</v>

52
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:25.281
<v Speaker 1>but your answer under those conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that being is such that it would be </v>

53
00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>better if it had never been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very.</v>

54
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a very.</v>

55
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe because I think what happens </v>

56
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.391
<v Speaker 1>if you act it out is that you make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very things that lead you to despair far</v>

57
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:44.061
<v Speaker 1>worse and I can't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's reasonable to draw a logical </v>

58
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:48.231
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that suffering should you </v>
<v Speaker 1>justify as your desire to make being in </v>

59
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>that the answer to that can be to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce more suffering.</v>

60
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.730
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my observation has been that people </v>

61
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>who act out the Memphis defilippo and </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy inevitably make suffering far</v>

62
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>worse and so and then that raises the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other specter of well do.</v>

63
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:10.801
<v Speaker 1>They weren't being just to cease or are </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just out for bloody revenge at </v>

64
00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at any cost.</v>

65
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>And Mike Inclusion has always been that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the mask is well being shouldn't</v>

66
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:20.941
<v Speaker 1>exist because it's too terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the true motivation is I'm going to </v>

67
00:03:20.941 --> 00:03:24.331
<v Speaker 1>make everyone suffer as much as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly can before I say goodbye to </v>

68
00:03:24.331 --> 00:03:27.901
<v Speaker 1>this place and if you read the writings </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people like the kids who shot up the </v>

69
00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:29.280
<v Speaker 1>columbine high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you exactly that.</v>

70
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>That's precisely and exactly what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>concluded and then act it out.</v>

71
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in this God says that it was good.</v>

72
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about that a lot is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the question is something like,</v>

73
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it something better than nothing?</v>

74
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

75
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>and I thought about two things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to that and one is,</v>

76
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.410
<v Speaker 1>one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe it depends on how it is that </v>

77
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.541
<v Speaker 1>you are right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it could be that there are ways </v>

78
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>of being in the world that justify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and there are ways of being in the</v>

79
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:05.431
<v Speaker 1>world that make the world unbearable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that the narrative that </v>

80
00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:09.481
<v Speaker 1>runs through the biblical stories is </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely a dialogue between those two </v>

81
00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:13.351
<v Speaker 1>types of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the optimistic part of the story is </v>

82
00:04:13.351 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 1>that being requires limitation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

83
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 1>There's no escape from that.</v>

84
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.990
<v Speaker 1>But there are modes of being that allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to be perhaps even more than </v>

85
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.071
<v Speaker 1>tolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps there are modes of being that </v>

86
00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 1>allow that to be good and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight and narrow road.</v>

87
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a very difficult road to tread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

88
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:30.110
<v Speaker 1>so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

89
00:04:30.111 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>that that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

90
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an optimist by nature and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

91
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:39.931
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that I've </v>

92
00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:42.270
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized and read about that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually find plausible because it's </v>

93
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.790
<v Speaker 1>certainly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows this,</v>

94
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 1>that there are ways that you can act and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make things worse.</v>

95
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if that's the case,</v>

96
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 1>there has to be the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 1>There has to be ways that you could act </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make things better.</v>

98
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 1>And obviously you can act in ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things really way worse.</v>

99
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

100
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 1>are there ways that you can actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things really much better?</v>

101
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.940
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the question is can </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have our cake and eat it too?</v>

102
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Can we have the being that requires </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitation and suffering and also </v>

103
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously transcend that by our </v>
<v Speaker 1>mode of being.</v>

104
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.800
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that the biblical stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps not only the biblical </v>

105
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.050
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the biblical stories,</v>

106
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:25.051
<v Speaker 1>are they human?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine one of the human imaginations </v>

107
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 1>best attempts to address and answer that</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

108
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 1>That's what the entire story is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first of it is the catastrophe of</v>

109
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 1>the collapse of self consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entrance of humanity into history.</v>

110
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 1>And the rest of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

111
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 1>now we're in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we know that we're going to die.</v>

112
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:45.991
<v Speaker 1>We know about our mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're conscious of our own being is the </v>

113
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:49.711
<v Speaker 1>remote of acting in the world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows that to be justifiable or maybe </v>

114
00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>even more that allows that to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>triumphant.</v>

115
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>And then I would also say maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth finding out.</v>

116
00:05:56.321 --> 00:06:01.321
<v Speaker 1>You know that the other thing that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because you've got this </v>

117
00:06:01.321 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 1>short time on earth and there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are very,</v>

118
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:07.241
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to contend with and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have the problem of tolerating </v>

119
00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:12.101
<v Speaker 1>yourself even in all your insufficiency </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that seems to me </v>

120
00:06:12.101 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>to be the case is that if you adopt a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently profound mode of being,</v>

121
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:19.961
<v Speaker 1>if you attempt to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the mere act of lifting up that </v>

122
00:06:19.961 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 1>weight is enough to justify the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're insufficient and mortal and,</v>

123
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.150
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

124
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.160
<v Speaker 1>and bound by tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that and I believe people </v>

125
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>believe that because if you watch how </v>
<v Speaker 1>people act,</v>

126
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>they look for people they admire and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do admire people,</v>

127
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural.</v>

128
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it starting with children being </v>

129
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.820
<v Speaker 1>children admire and then they imitate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we look to people who seem to be </v>

130
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.691
<v Speaker 1>able to bear the burden of being in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroic manner and there's something </v>

131
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:52.120
<v Speaker 1>inside of us that calls to that and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes us want to,</v>

132
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 1>to mimic that and to follow it.</v>

133
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's the deepest and most</v>

134
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:02.891
<v Speaker 1>profound of instincts and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and even if you're not so </v>

135
00:07:02.891 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 1>convinced on the positive end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>because it's more difficult to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced of the positive.</v>

137
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.470
<v Speaker 1>You can certainly be convinced on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative end because there are ways of </v>

138
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.861
<v Speaker 1>being that are so brutal and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible that merely to read about </v>

139
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:20.171
<v Speaker 1>them is enough to traumatize you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if you're a person who </v>

140
00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:24.281
<v Speaker 1>hasn't lost their soul completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't help but encounter stories </v>

141
00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 1>like that and shudder away from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

142
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Alexander Solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

143
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 1>who was the person who did most </v>
<v Speaker 1>unmasked,</v>

144
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 1>the absolute horrors of communist </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism,</v>

145
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.280
<v Speaker 1>said that he believed that the Nuremberg</v>
<v Speaker 1>judgments were the most important event </v>

146
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.941
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that was the judgment at the </v>

147
00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:49.630
<v Speaker 1>end of World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there were certain actions that no </v>

148
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.971
<v Speaker 1>one was to undertake no matter what </v>
<v Speaker 1>their cultural background was because </v>

149
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:51.971
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

150
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:52.820
<v Speaker 1>crimes against humanity.</v>

151
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 1>That there was such a thing as universal</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

152
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.940
<v Speaker 1>And you can debate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

153
00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

154
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.890
<v Speaker 1>and people certainly have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is,</v>

155
00:08:01.891 --> 00:08:06.891
<v Speaker 1>is if you debate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to say that there are </v>

156
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:09.821
<v Speaker 1>conditions under which the sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that happen say in the </v>

157
00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:12.431
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be the gassing of children </v>

158
00:08:12.431 --> 00:08:12.431
<v Speaker 1>after their torture and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>

159
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 1>they're forcible removal from their </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents and all the terrible things that</v>

160
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 1>went along with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's just okay.</v>

161
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:23.230
<v Speaker 1>It's just an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just something that happened and </v>

162
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>there are circumstances under which </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's justifiable if you,</v>

163
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 1>if there's no transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good and evil underneath that argument,</v>

164
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:30.250
<v Speaker 1>it's only a matter of practicality and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

165
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me that that's,</v>

166
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 1>that's not the right conclusion to draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it seems to me.</v>

167
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:40.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's what Solzhenitsyn concluded </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he looked at the Nuremberg trials.</v>

168
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.640
<v Speaker 1>So the notion that the notion that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was good,</v>

169
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 1>well even if you don't believe that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:50.870
<v Speaker 1>because maybe it's not as good as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be,</v>

171
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's incumbent on you as </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who participates.</v>

172
00:08:55.110 --> 00:09:00.110
<v Speaker 1>The process of of furthering creation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>act as if it couldn't be good at least,</v>

173
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 1>and to further that with with all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your efforts,</v>

174
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:08.730
<v Speaker 1>part of it because what the hell else do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do that could possibly be </v>

175
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.991
<v Speaker 1>better than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could possibly justify your </v>

176
00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:14.631
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than that and you know perfectly </v>

177
00:09:14.631 --> 00:09:14.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

178
00:09:14.631 --> 00:09:14.631
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have any sense at all,</v>

179
00:09:14.631 --> 00:09:19.491
<v Speaker 1>if you think clearly about it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that that's what you want to see in </v>

180
00:09:19.491 --> 00:09:19.491
<v Speaker 1>every one else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

181
00:09:19.491 --> 00:09:19.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

182
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:23.490
<v Speaker 1>you're desperate and maybe you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical and now and then someone appears</v>

183
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:28.491
<v Speaker 1>that acts at least momentarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a light in the darkness and that </v>

184
00:09:28.491 --> 00:09:31.850
<v Speaker 1>lifts your spirit up and gives you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of hope and maybe helps you </v>

185
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:31.850
<v Speaker 1>continue on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's well.</v>

186
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.120
<v Speaker 1>That's obviously a call to being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

187
00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a statement from your own soul that</v>

188
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

189
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 1>there's something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you should be,</v>

190
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.730
<v Speaker 1>and maybe then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

191
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 1>we get a chance to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to participate in what is good.</v>
