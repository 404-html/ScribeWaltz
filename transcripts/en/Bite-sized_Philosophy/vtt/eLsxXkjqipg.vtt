1
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.950
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievable the degree to which </v>

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.850
<v Speaker 1>our sanity depends on our functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sociological structure and,</v>

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>and here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:14.541
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of need to know what to do </v>

5
00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:17.481
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a routine because </v>

6
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:17.481
<v Speaker 1>you're an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>and you know if you have a dog or a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs are really good example of this.</v>

8
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:24.081
<v Speaker 1>Dogs like routine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like to be walked the number of </v>

9
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:26.931
<v Speaker 1>times a day that they're supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked and they get quite sick very </v>

10
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:26.931
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>

11
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>if you don't routinize their days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children are exactly the same way.</v>

12
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Now you can overdo it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:34.410
<v Speaker 1>But still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>you need to know approximately when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should get up,</v>

15
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>should be approximately the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>

16
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>You need to know approximately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going,</v>

17
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:46.011
<v Speaker 1>when you're going to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to know what you're going to </v>

18
00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:46.011
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

19
00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:46.011
<v Speaker 1>You need to know who you're going to eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

20
00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>You need to know where to buy your food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 80 percent of your life,</v>

21
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.930
<v Speaker 1>70 percent of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that consists of those </v>

22
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>things that you do every single day that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you repeat,</v>

23
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.460
<v Speaker 1>and those are often the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people think about as the trivial </v>

24
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.521
<v Speaker 1>elements of their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things I would like to </v>

25
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>point out to you if you do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics I,</v>

26
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I did this with a client of mine who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a hard time putting his child to </v>

27
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.871
<v Speaker 1>bet they were having a fight every night</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I knew by that time the studies </v>

28
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:19.581
<v Speaker 1>indicate that most parents only spend 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes per day of one on one time with </v>

29
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:24.531
<v Speaker 1>their child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason for that is that people </v>

30
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:28.041
<v Speaker 1>are busy and it's actually not that easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to parse out 20 minutes of one on one </v>

31
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:28.041
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

32
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot bloody more time than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

33
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>but that's all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty minutes and he's spending like 40</v>

34
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:38.811
<v Speaker 1>minutes a day fighting with his kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get the kid to go to bed and </v>

35
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>that's not very entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

36
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

37
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>it's just having a scrap with a kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>about going to bed,</v>

38
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

39
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

40
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

41
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 1>If it happens every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a catastrophe,</v>

42
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>so you do the math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll say five hours a week for the </v>

43
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to keep it simple.</v>

44
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:57.810
<v Speaker 1>It's 20 hours a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 240 hours a year.</v>

45
00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:02.811
<v Speaker 1>That's 60 slash 40 hour work weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that guy was basically spending a </v>

46
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>month and a half of work weeks doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely nothing but having a wretched</v>

47
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>time fighting with his son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get them to go to bed.</v>

48
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>That's just way too much time to spend </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something like that.</v>

50
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.570
<v Speaker 1>If you want to actually have a positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with someone because it's </v>

51
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 1>just too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just too punishing and so well,</v>

52
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:28.401
<v Speaker 1>so you need structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need predictability and you need </v>

53
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>more of it than you think just to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>you sane.</v>

54
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky and and maybe a bit odd,</v>

55
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.820
<v Speaker 1>you can deviate five percent from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>norm or 10 percent from the norm or </v>

56
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>something like that carefully and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cautiously.</v>

57
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>As long as the rest of you is all well </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordered,</v>

58
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:47.751
<v Speaker 1>an informative manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to get away with that </v>

59
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:50.451
<v Speaker 1>and you might be able to sustain that </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time and people might be able to </v>

60
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:53.571
<v Speaker 1>tolerate you if you do it or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get really lucky and you happen </v>

61
00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:56.991
<v Speaker 1>to be creative but reasonably well put </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and people will actually be </v>

62
00:02:56.991 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>happy that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiosyncratic and unique about you.</v>

63
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.440
<v Speaker 1>But even under those circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly what you want is to have a </v>

64
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's disciplined,</v>

65
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>that's predictable and bloody well stick</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

66
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be way healthier and </v>
<v Speaker 1>happier and Saner if you do that.</v>

67
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:17.131
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is one of the things the </v>

68
00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:20.911
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalyst got wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is that they overestimated the </v>

69
00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 1>degree to which sanity was a consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of internal,</v>

70
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>of being properly structured internally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

71
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>because from the psychoanalytic point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>

72
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:33.601
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of an ego and that ego is </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside you and of course it rests on an </v>

73
00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:37.441
<v Speaker 1>unconscious structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the purpose of psychoanalytic </v>

74
00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:40.170
<v Speaker 1>analysis is to sort out that unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and the ego on top of it and </v>

75
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 1>to make you a fully functioning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous individual,</v>

76
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.390
<v Speaker 1>but there's a problem with that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you're saying as a fully</v>

77
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:54.691
<v Speaker 1>functional and antonymous human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't because you've organized your </v>

78
00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though that's important.</v>

79
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.150
<v Speaker 1>The reason that you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're aware,</v>

80
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.200
<v Speaker 1>if you have a well organized unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ego is because other people can </v>

81
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>tolerate having you around for </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably extensive periods of time and</v>

82
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:12.331
<v Speaker 1>we'll cuff you across the back of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head every time you do something so </v>

83
00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>stupid that people will dislike you </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently if you continue,</v>

84
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>and so what people are doing to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other all the time,</v>

85
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:22.710
<v Speaker 1>just nonstop is broadcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sanity signals back and forth,</v>

86
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you smile at people.</v>

87
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:30.001
<v Speaker 1>If they're well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're not only behaving property </v>

88
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>but behaving in a way that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to see them continue to behave,</v>

89
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>you frown at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're not,</v>

90
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>you ignore them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're not,</v>

91
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 1>you shun them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

92
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 1>you roll your eyes out them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You manifested disgust face.</v>

93
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you interrupt them,</v>

94
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 1>you won't cooperate with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't compete with them.</v>

95
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're blasting signals of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people about how to regulate their</v>

96
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>behavior so frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

97
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:54.541
<v Speaker 1>it just makes up all of your social </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction and that's why we face each </v>

98
00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:58.021
<v Speaker 1>other and we have emotional displays on </v>
<v Speaker 1>her face and we're looking at each </v>

99
00:04:58.021 --> 00:05:01.201
<v Speaker 1>other's eyes and we know exactly we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as we can about what's going on </v>

100
00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:05.671
<v Speaker 1>with each other given that we don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate access to the contents of </v>

101
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:09.151
<v Speaker 1>their consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what you're doing with </v>

102
00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 1>your routine is establishing yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a credible,</v>

103
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.820
<v Speaker 1>reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trustworthy,</v>

104
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.970
<v Speaker 1>potentially interesting human being who </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to do anything too erratic </v>

105
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.800
<v Speaker 1>at any moment and everyone else is </v>
<v Speaker 1>around there tapping you into shape,</v>

106
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:24.700
<v Speaker 1>making sure that that's exactly what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and that's how you stay sane.</v>

107
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:29.701
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens to people too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't have a routine and they </v>

108
00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:33.151
<v Speaker 1>get isolated as they start to drift and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they drift badly because the world is </v>

109
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 1>too complicated for you to keep it </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized all by yourself.</v>

110
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 1>You just cannot do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of our,</v>

111
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.360
<v Speaker 1>so we outsource the problem of sanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very intelligent that we </v>

112
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.131
<v Speaker 1>outsourced the problem of sanity because</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanity is an impossibly complex problem.</v>

113
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.520
<v Speaker 1>And so the way that we manage the </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly complex problem is we have a </v>

114
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.571
