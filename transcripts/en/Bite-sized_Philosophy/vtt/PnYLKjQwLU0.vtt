00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.170
<v Speaker 1>The snake in the garden of Eden is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting character.</v>

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Human beings and their closest </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological relative chimpanzees are </v>

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>innately afraid of and attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reptiles.</v>

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.810
<v Speaker 1>They automatically trigger off responses</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a part of the brain called the </v>

5
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.261
<v Speaker 1>Amygdala that's associated with anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the evolutionary reason for </v>

6
00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:25.551
<v Speaker 1>this is that mammals and reptiles have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been at war in a sense over ecological </v>

7
00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>turf for something between $60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million and 200 million years.</v>

8
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Reptilian features which are cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>blooded,</v>

9
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.840
<v Speaker 1>a piercing I'd tooth lurking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nocturnal out there,</v>

10
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>out in the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Outward chaos is the snake is </v>

11
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>representative of the unknown in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

12
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.740
<v Speaker 1>and it's an ambivalent feature and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that you see that even in its used </v>

13
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.450
<v Speaker 1>in mythology because for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon in in,</v>

14
00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>in western culture is a negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>feature,</v>

15
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>but in Chinese culture it's positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>feature.</v>

16
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>So the unknown is like that.</v>

17
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>It's positive and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The snake in the garden of Eden is </v>

18
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>representative of all those things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lurk.</v>

19
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.990
<v Speaker 1>When you think you know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and when you think you know what </v>

20
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've carved out this little.</v>

21
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Eden has little paradise in which you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating,</v>

22
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>but there's always something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>lurking and that's all the things you're</v>

23
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>not paying attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>that's the snake and we're not snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>pops up.</v>

25
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>People are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're wired.</v>

26
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>If a little snake pops out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might want to run away from it,</v>

27
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 1>but like we're curious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go over there and </v>

28
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 1>investigate right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

29
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>when chimps come across a python in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest,</v>

30
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>they have a specific cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a snake wrath,</v>

31
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>and the chimps who don't like snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't run from it.</v>

32
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>They back off and then they watched the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

33
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.500
<v Speaker 1>They cannot tear their eyes away from it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of the most stand there and </v>

34
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.671
<v Speaker 1>look at it for 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other individuals will stand there for </v>

35
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>hours watching the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unknown is fascinating.</v>

36
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:01.731
<v Speaker 1>We can't look away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to encounter it even if it's </v>

37
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:01.731
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly why,</v>

38
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenagers like horror movies,</v>

39
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.690
<v Speaker 1>they're driven to look at the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're are driven to interact with the </v>

40
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Genesis,</v>

41
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the snake means the end</v>

42
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like it does in life,</v>

43
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.900
<v Speaker 1>there are ideas that the serpent in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden of Eden was Satan and trying to </v>

44
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.460
<v Speaker 1>destroy God's handiwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People often look back in their lives </v>

45
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.460
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

46
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got knocked out of my little paradise </v>

47
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:30.051
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:32.841
<v Speaker 1>this particular event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but looking back on it really made me </v>

49
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:32.841
<v Speaker 1>grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really made me mature.</v>

50
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the serpent in the garden of Eden</v>

51
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:37.650
<v Speaker 1>certainly plays that role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a catalyst.</v>

52
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Much of what's unknown is redemptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of what's unknown gives life saver.</v>

53
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

54
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 1>it provides the kind of excitement that </v>
<v Speaker 1>justifies suffering.</v>

55
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.680
<v Speaker 1>The injunction behind religious thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally is that you should live </v>

56
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.331
<v Speaker 1>your life in such a way that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering it has to contain because </v>

57
00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>you're confined and vulnerable is </v>
<v Speaker 1>justified.</v>
