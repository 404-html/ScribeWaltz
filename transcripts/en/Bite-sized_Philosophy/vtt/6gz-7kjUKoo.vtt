1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.700
<v Speaker 1>It's the beginning of the lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do,</v>

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.290
<v Speaker 1>how does morality from</v>

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.710
<v Speaker 2>stronger and weaker to what's good and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it depends to some degree on </v>

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.201
<v Speaker 2>what you mean by stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So physical strength is one element and </v>

6
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:23.631
<v Speaker 2>like if you look at mythological heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that the stories of heroes are </v>

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.970
<v Speaker 2>fragmented elements of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.060
<v Speaker 2>of the archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one kind of archetypal hero </v>

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 2>obviously as someone who's physically </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong,</v>

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that there's a great movie that </v>

11
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 2>you could watch about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called Hitman Hart.</v>

12
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the best documentaries I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen and it's about this guy named </v>

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Bret Harte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bret Harte was for awhile,</v>

14
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 2>the most famous Canadian on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was a worldwide wrestling </v>

15
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 2>foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

16
00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:52.780
<v Speaker 2>What did they call that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wwf?</v>

17
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was there,</v>

18
00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 2>like lead good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he and wrestling,</v>

19
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I love the documentary because when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a little kid,</v>

20
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:06.391
<v Speaker 2>like four or five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to watch his father whose name </v>

21
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 2>was Stu Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who ran this channel,</v>

22
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.090
<v Speaker 2>this wrestling confederation in Alberta.</v>

23
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 2>And Stu Hart had I think eight boys and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he trained all of them to be pro </v>

24
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.681
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers and part of the movie is </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily funny because Stu Hart </v>

25
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:22.540
<v Speaker 2>is in it and he's really old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like 85 and he's just barely.</v>

26
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like a pro wrestler for 40 years,</v>

27
00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:30.241
<v Speaker 2>like every joint is broken and he still </v>
<v Speaker 2>big but he's just barely moving and this</v>

28
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 2>is this kid and another kid come over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm.</v>

29
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Stu is telling the story about how it </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to take his boys into the basement </v>

30
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.131
<v Speaker 2>and toughen them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think Brett called that the </v>

31
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:47.101
<v Speaker 2>journey to pain or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His father would take all these kids </v>

32
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:50.431
<v Speaker 2>down there and wrestle with them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>push them right to the edge of their </v>

33
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:50.830
<v Speaker 2>pain tolerance constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>

34
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.330
<v Speaker 2>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they grew up tough.</v>

35
00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:53.500
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that.</v>

36
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.770
<v Speaker 2>And all his daughters married pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers to.</v>

37
00:01:56.771 --> 00:02:00.790
<v Speaker 2>And I think he had seven daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's quite the character anyways.</v>

38
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.580
<v Speaker 2>These two kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like their late adolescence,</v>

39
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:08.581
<v Speaker 2>early adulthood come over and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them's pretty damn cocky and he's </v>

40
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:10.090
<v Speaker 2>listening to Stewart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says something smart like,</v>

41
00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:10.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

42
00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 2>you were pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were pretty tough with the old days.</v>

43
00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stew looks at them and says,</v>

44
00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:14.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

45
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you come down to the basement </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me?</v>

46
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.490
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

47
00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:20.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hurt you old man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

48
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 2>so they're filmmakers follow them into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the basement day and like they're kind </v>

49
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.350
<v Speaker 2>of standing there and the old guy grabs </v>
<v Speaker 2>him in a headlock.</v>

50
00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:31.060
<v Speaker 2>It takes him like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like a snake,</v>

51
00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:36.061
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got her in a headlock like so fast </v>

52
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:36.061
<v Speaker 2>that the kid doesn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>

53
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 2>So stew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

54
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 2>who knows how to put a headlock on </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>

55
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.960
<v Speaker 2>He's flexing his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his uh,</v>

56
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.200
<v Speaker 2>his uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

57
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.450
<v Speaker 2>his forearm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:48.451
<v Speaker 2>Which is still not so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A forearm and he's got this guy's face </v>

59
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:49.030
<v Speaker 2>is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just,</v>

60
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.920
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's stepped in a bear trap.</v>

61
00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Plus he's absolutely shocked that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>old guy got him.</v>

62
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.790
<v Speaker 2>And so he's kind of gasping and stu says</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>

63
00:02:57.791 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 2>you watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I flex this just right,</v>

64
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 2>and you can see this vein on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>forehead start to pop out.</v>

65
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.510
<v Speaker 2>It's extraordinarily funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

66
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Bret Hart plays out the good guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetype and Brett's like,</v>

67
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:11.750
<v Speaker 2>he's a solid guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>

68
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.920
<v Speaker 2>I would say he's not particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated and I'm not being cruel </v>

69
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.581
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had a great career and he's </v>

70
00:03:20.581 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 2>tough as a boot and so good for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he plays out this,</v>

71
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 2>this good guy archetype and he gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>tangled up in it.</v>

72
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 2>And now I don't remember your damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

73
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 2>but I am trying to answer it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me the question again.</v>

74
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

75
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

76
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:43.441
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things I really liked </v>

77
00:03:43.441 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 2>about this movie was it showed me why </v>
<v Speaker 2>people watched wrestling and I couldn't,</v>

78
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't because certainly they're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>appealing and I'm not being.</v>

79
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.150
<v Speaker 2>There are different strata of conception</v>
<v Speaker 2>of abstraction that any entertainment </v>

80
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 2>process has to appeal to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

81
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:02.821
<v Speaker 2>most people don't go to movies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually because it really is </v>

82
00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:04.970
<v Speaker 2>because movies operate at a level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophistication that are too high,</v>

83
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 2>that is too high for many people just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like novels.</v>

84
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean hardly anyone reads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:15.151
<v Speaker 2>and if you about 15 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population might be 20 percent cannot </v>

86
00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 2>read well enough to follow written </v>
<v Speaker 2>instructions and so and,</v>

87
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.510
<v Speaker 2>and they and people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's 15 percent of the population </v>

88
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 2>or 10 percent have never finished a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

89
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

90
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 2>and it is that high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

91
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 2>but you still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still,</v>

92
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.580
<v Speaker 2>the archetypes still needs to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself at different levels and so it </v>

93
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.031
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself in wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even there where it is physical </v>

94
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 2>force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just physical force,</v>

95
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.820
<v Speaker 2>like it's a drama between good and evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can see this so clearly and in </v>

96
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.010
<v Speaker 2>the Bret Hart documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's the good guy and you know,</v>

97
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 2>the bad guys are really over the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

98
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a real drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's good versus evil in the </v>

99
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.481
<v Speaker 2>rain every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And hopefully good winds but good often </v>

100
00:04:57.481 --> 00:04:57.481
<v Speaker 2>gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

101
00:04:57.481 --> 00:05:01.761
<v Speaker 2>maybe the bad wrestler brings two of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends in and they bring in chairs and </v>

102
00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 2>they bashed the hell out of the good </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

103
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 2>And the whole audience is just outraged </v>
<v Speaker 2>by this.</v>

104
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 2>And and the documentary does a lovely </v>
<v Speaker 2>job of showing that,</v>

105
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 2>but so even at the level of physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat,</v>

106
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:16.651
<v Speaker 2>let's say you can't reduce what's good </v>
<v Speaker 2>to what strong is just one element of it</v>

107
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.230
<v Speaker 2>better to be strong than to be weak and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can have a strong hero because </v>

108
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 2>it's better to be strong than to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>weak,</v>

109
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's better to be strong and kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>than to be strong and it's better to be </v>

110
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 2>strong and kind and wise than to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong and kind and so.</v>

111
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.530
<v Speaker 2>And that's true not only for human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings but it's even true,</v>

112
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:40.531
<v Speaker 2>let's say at the wolf for the chimpanzee</v>
<v Speaker 2>level because one of the things you see </v>

113
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 2>with the chimp dominance hierarchies if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think I mentioned this before,</v>

114
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:48.571
<v Speaker 2>is if the leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dominant male is really good at </v>

115
00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:52.890
<v Speaker 2>fostering social relations and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>reciprocal in acts like grooming and </v>

116
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 2>also paying attention to the females and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their offspring.</v>

117
00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.420
<v Speaker 2>His dynasty will be much more stable and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so strong might be good for one battle.</v>

118
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 2>It might be good for two battles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for 50 battles it's not optimized.</v>

119
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 2>Especially because no law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how strong you are,</v>

120
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.160
<v Speaker 2>someone can take you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

121
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 2>so what happens is the idea of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal becomes increasingly complex </v>

122
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 2>across time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multifaceted,</v>

123
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so strength,</v>

124
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 2>wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

125
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:27.311
<v Speaker 2>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things are amalgamated into a </v>

126
00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 2>single ba and we'll talk a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because I want to show you how that</v>

127
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:34.241
<v Speaker 2>happened in Mesopotamia because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the first places where we have </v>

128
00:06:34.241 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 2>documentation about how that ideally </v>
<v Speaker 2>merged.</v>

129
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 2>They have a god called Marduk and Martin</v>
<v Speaker 2>had 50 names and as far as I can tell,</v>

130
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:45.131
<v Speaker 2>the reason for that was that mark was an</v>
<v Speaker 2>amalgam of the tribal Dante's of at </v>

131
00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:49.481
<v Speaker 2>least 50 tribes and and when the within </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribes were brought together and </v>

132
00:06:49.481 --> 00:06:53.891
<v Speaker 2>civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each of their gods who were ideals had </v>

133
00:06:53.891 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 2>to be amalgamated into something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a single,</v>

134
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 2>a single dramatized representation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>

135
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:02.330
<v Speaker 2>Or there was no way that all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people could have lived together.</v>

136
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are different value structures </v>

137
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.390
<v Speaker 2>would have fragmented them and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have stayed in a state of war.</v>

138
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 2>And so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the question you're asking?</v>

139
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.740
<v Speaker 2>If it's not strength than what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

140
00:07:13.741 --> 00:07:18.741
<v Speaker 2>it's strength is an element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Egyptians figured out that it </v>

141
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:22.391
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vision is actually the capacity to pay </v>

142
00:07:22.391 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was paramount and the Mesopotamians</v>

143
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 2>have that figured out more or less too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're god.</v>

144
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Marduk had eyes all the way around his </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

145
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.510
<v Speaker 2>He could see everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So seeing was a critical element of what</v>

146
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:37.511
<v Speaker 2>should be on top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing for the </v>

147
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamians was the ability to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the time of Mesopotamia,</v>

148
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:44.300
<v Speaker 2>people that already dramatized the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the cardinal human attributes,</v>

149
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:49.301
<v Speaker 2>our vision and the ability to speak so </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not be the ability to speak the </v>

150
00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not just speak so.</v>
