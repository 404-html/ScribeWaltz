1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.810
<v Speaker 1>God has a little chat with him and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

2
00:00:01.811 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>W W,</v>

3
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.910
<v Speaker 1>why are you angry and and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you upset?</v>

4
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>And cain says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and God says,</v>

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.310
<v Speaker 1>if you do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't you be accepted?</v>

6
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sin lies at your door and unto thee </v>

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.370
<v Speaker 1>shall be his desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now shout rule over him.</v>

8
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very mangled translation I </v>

9
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.530
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to take it apart.</v>

10
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>So what God says is while you're angry </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're upset,</v>

11
00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:27.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

12
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>what's your problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then God tells kate if you did </v>

13
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.720
<v Speaker 1>things properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would work out for you.</v>

14
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the last thing he wants to hear it </v>

15
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>because what cain wants to believe is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the reason he's not doing very well</v>

16
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.760
<v Speaker 1>is because there's no sense having any </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith in the logos.</v>

17
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.690
<v Speaker 1>The transcendent is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is evil and aimed exactly against him,</v>

18
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.730
<v Speaker 1>and the entire social contract is </v>
<v Speaker 1>faulty.</v>

19
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what he wants to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what God says.</v>

20
00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:52.480
<v Speaker 1>God says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

21
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.080
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're doing something wrong.</v>

22
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

23
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>that's maybe a worse message than </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else is corrupt.</v>

24
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're having a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're just not everything you </v>

25
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>and then God says something really nasty</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't tell from this lines.</v>

27
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>I read a bunch of translations to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out exactly what it meant.</v>

28
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>So this is what God tells kate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

29
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>you're in a room in a house and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something at the door,</v>

30
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>and he uses a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God uses a metaphor.</v>

31
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot aroused predatory cat,</v>

32
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>and you invited in even invited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that it has evil intent.</v>

33
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.510
<v Speaker 1>You invited in to meet with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>And you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

35
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>it's union with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

36
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.390
<v Speaker 1>this malevolent force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sexual union with you has produced </v>

37
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>an offspring and that offspring is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>possesses you.</v>

38
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 1>And so not only have you done something </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

39
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.190
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've invited the spirit of wrongdoing </v>

40
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.730
<v Speaker 1>into your life and you've creatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermingled it with it voluntarily to </v>

41
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>bring forth a monster of your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation.</v>

42
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's what God tells Kane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

43
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.840
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bad enough that God says,</v>

44
00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:09.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should get your act together because</v>

45
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's why things aren't going so </v>
<v Speaker 1>well for you before you criticize the </v>

46
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.910
<v Speaker 1>transcendent and the world and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of being.</v>

47
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're doing something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's worse than that.</v>

48
00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:20.560
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are you doing something wrong,</v>

49
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.010
<v Speaker 1>you bloody well know you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong and you and you're doing</v>

50
00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:29.011
<v Speaker 1>it creatively and with intent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so not only are things not going well </v>

51
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:32.881
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've played a creative role in </v>

52
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.260
<v Speaker 1>producing that situation and so god </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically says,</v>

53
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I am taking zero responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejecting your sacrifice.</v>

54
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.490
<v Speaker 1>It's all on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so kane leaves and he's like,</v>

55
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.610
<v Speaker 1>seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Happy with that response because he </v>

56
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.630
<v Speaker 1>wanted to hear Pat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pat,</v>

57
00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:52.660
<v Speaker 1>you're a victim of circumstance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's conspiring against you.</v>

58
00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:57.661
<v Speaker 1>And really being God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should get my act together and just </v>

59
00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:57.661
<v Speaker 1>give you what you want.</v>

60
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously being God I'm wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're right.</v>

61
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Well that isn't what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the opposite of that.</v>

62
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>It's completely on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

63
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>that's the judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so kane leaves and believe me,</v>

64
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was wroth before it.</v>

65
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 1>His countenance had fallen before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's nothing like it is now.</v>

66
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>And so he's hits the next stage and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks,</v>

67
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take my revenge.</v>

68
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.600
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find the most innocent and </v>

69
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile thing that's favored of God </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to kill it.</v>

70
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't matter.</v>

71
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>That's his brother and able,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>we're drawing the inference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ables done the right things.</v>

73
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Everyone likes them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's flourishing for Abel.</v>

74
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.160
<v Speaker 1>He's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those people that you meet </v>

75
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.380
<v Speaker 1>that has everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you meet them and you wish you </v>

76
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.391
<v Speaker 1>could hate them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't because they're really </v>

77
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:45.391
<v Speaker 1>good people.</v>

78
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>And then you're really hate them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only do they have everything,</v>

79
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>but it appears that they deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing that sort of sits in</v>

80
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>your soul and rots it more than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>realization.</v>

81
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the situation with Cain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so thinks Cain talked with Abel,</v>

82
00:03:56.921 --> 00:04:01.921
<v Speaker 1>his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it came to pass when they were in </v>

83
00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:01.921
<v Speaker 1>the field that Cain rose up against </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abel,</v>

84
00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and slew him.</v>

85
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's so interesting because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what happens to cane here.</v>

86
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>So he's not doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's separated from the transcendent and</v>

87
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:16.741
<v Speaker 1>from society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's bitterly resentful and now he goes </v>

88
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>out and kills the very thing that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>most wants to be.</v>

89
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.130
<v Speaker 1>So he destroys his own ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>He just demolishes his own ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how far his resentment has pushed</v>

91
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:26.590
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's,</v>

92
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 1>he's done right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't matter because it enables</v>

93
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 1>him to take revenge.</v>

94
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>So he doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

95
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:37.861
<v Speaker 1>it's like the suicidal school shooter </v>
<v Speaker 1>that blows off his head at the end of </v>

96
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 1>his mayhem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it doesn't matter to him.</v>

97
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the same art form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Lord says unto Cain,</v>

98
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 1>where is Abel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And cain said,</v>

99
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

100
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:49.250
<v Speaker 1>am I my brother's keeper?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While that's a good question,</v>

101
00:04:49.251 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>and that's why it's posed in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the answer that I supposed to be</v>

102
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God says,</v>

103
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:58.861
<v Speaker 1>what have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Voice of your brother's blood cries </v>

104
00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:01.680
<v Speaker 1>unto me from the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually the Motif that </v>

105
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky explorers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say in crime and punishment </v>

106
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.890
<v Speaker 1>because what happens is that was calling</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coffee's cane for all intents and </v>

107
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he commits a murder,</v>

108
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.400
<v Speaker 1>but he gets away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

109
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.950
<v Speaker 1>so he thinks so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We thinks no one suspects him.</v>

110
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 1>He buries the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't stand to touch the body.</v>

111
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.040
<v Speaker 1>He buries it in a in an abandoned lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's drawn there now and then to </v>

112
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>look at where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he can't touch it because the money.</v>

113
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.320
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny because the money before </v>
<v Speaker 1>he kills the pawnbroker is not the same </v>

114
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>as the money after he kills the pawn </v>
<v Speaker 1>broker.</v>

115
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.670
<v Speaker 1>And the risk only the before he kills </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pawnbroker is not the same as the </v>

116
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>risk and the cough after he kills the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pole broker.</v>

117
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not the same at all.</v>

118
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>And so [inaudible] Nicole have is </v>
<v Speaker 1>tormented by God,</v>

119
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.330
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not from the external world.</v>

120
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.470
<v Speaker 1>He sets the crime up quite nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that this,</v>

121
00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>this spirit against which transgressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>tortures him from within and there's no </v>

122
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:05.861
<v Speaker 1>escape from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so eventually what happens in crime </v>

123
00:06:05.861 --> 00:06:08.711
<v Speaker 1>and punishment is was called Nicole have</v>
<v Speaker 1>continues to manifest himself as guilty </v>

124
00:06:08.711 --> 00:06:13.481
<v Speaker 1>in every possible way until he receives </v>
<v Speaker 1>the punishment that he desires because </v>

125
00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>it's the only way that he can set things</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

126
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>He actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually,</v>

127
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.360
<v Speaker 1>he essentially turns himself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually because he can't tolerate </v>

128
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 1>what he's done so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the idea.</v>

129
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 1>The Voice of thy brother's blood cries </v>
<v Speaker 1>unto me from the ground.</v>

130
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 1>It's guilt</v>

131
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.130
<v Speaker 1>and now you're cursed from the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>which has opened her mouth to receive </v>

132
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.500
<v Speaker 1>your brother's blood from thy hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you till the ground,</v>

133
00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:46.501
<v Speaker 1>it will not henceforth yield to you its </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and a fugitive and a vagabond </v>

134
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 1>shall thou be in the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

135
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.780
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why does God not just straight and </v>

136
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.261
<v Speaker 1>dead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that perhaps is that </v>

137
00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:04.350
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be sufficient punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like to me.</v>

138
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's the punishment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You live with what you did.</v>

139
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want anybody taking you out </v>

140
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>either because then you won't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live with what you did.</v>

141
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.670
<v Speaker 1>So that's the punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And cain says,</v>

142
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 1>under the Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my punishment is greater than I can </v>

143
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 1>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

144
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behold you have driven me out this day </v>

145
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.520
<v Speaker 1>from the face of the earth and from thy </v>
<v Speaker 1>face shall I be here.</v>

146
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the same as what happens to Adam </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the garden of Eden.</v>

147
00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:33.831
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam hides from God and he has his </v>

148
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:35.310
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now cain is alienated from God.</v>

149
00:07:35.311 --> 00:07:40.311
<v Speaker 1>There's no read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reconstructing that </v>

150
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:43.761
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's put himself by violating his </v>

151
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 1>contract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but say with the transcendent and also </v>

152
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 1>with society and also with his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit,</v>

153
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.190
<v Speaker 1>he's put himself outside the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>of redemption.</v>

154
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's why he says the punishment is</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater than I can bear.</v>

155
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.650
<v Speaker 1>There's no hope left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

156
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.110
<v Speaker 1>So he's in hell for all intents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>
