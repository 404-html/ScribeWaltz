1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your association task,</v>

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.490
<v Speaker 1>the principle is this word association </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

3
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>It's actually predicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say on psychoanalytic ideas,</v>

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.600
<v Speaker 1>most particularly on union ideas because</v>
<v Speaker 1>young development association tests </v>

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.600
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.041
<v Speaker 1>many years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it purports to investigate whether </v>

7
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>you are unconsciously bias towards one </v>
<v Speaker 1>group against another group.</v>

8
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Could be gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be ethnicity,</v>

9
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.290
<v Speaker 1>could be race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be attractiveness,</v>

10
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.550
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is that when you give</v>

11
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>the same person that damn it twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't get the same results.</v>

12
00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>So there's a rule for diagnostic tasks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rule is the reliability test,</v>

13
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:41.871
<v Speaker 1>retest reliability has to exceed </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like point eight or point </v>

14
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point eight at least.</v>

15
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>So the big five does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq tests do that,</v>

16
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:50.031
<v Speaker 1>but there's a dam a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's damn few tasks that passed that </v>

17
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>reliability criteria and the it is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only reliable,</v>

18
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's about point five,</v>

19
00:00:55.501 --> 00:01:00.501
<v Speaker 1>which isn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even near close enough to be </v>

20
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:00.501
<v Speaker 1>used as a diagnostic test.</v>

21
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's not valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

22
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say I assess your unconscious bias</v>

23
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>and give you a diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence that it predicts </v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior,</v>

25
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

26
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>What good is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What good is it?</v>

27
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good if you want people to send you</v>

28
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:22.611
<v Speaker 1>to retraining exercises so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have your perceptions adjusted in the </v>

29
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:27.051
<v Speaker 1>direction that your organization in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state thinks is proper and that's </v>

30
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:30.801
<v Speaker 1>happening everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got letters this week already for </v>

31
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:33.051
<v Speaker 1>people at CBC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's becoming mandatory there at St </v>

32
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Mike's Hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing and they've decided that all </v>

33
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>of their micro institutions within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital will be equitable.</v>

34
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>There'll be 50 percent women and 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent men at every single level of the</v>

35
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>organization or the organization is </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and oppressive.</v>

36
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's spreading so fast you can't believe</v>

37
00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:55.711
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote Mazur Anthony Greenwald </v>

38
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:55.711
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

39
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't set it off to some of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues say,</v>

40
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>are you going to come out and make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>public statement about the fact that </v>

41
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.761
<v Speaker 1>your damn test is being used by </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological people for nefarious </v>

42
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>purposes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

43
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:10.761
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see what they have to say about </v>

44
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:10.761
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a bit more polite in my letters,</v>

45
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>but there's no excuse for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's absolutely no excuse for it and </v>

46
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.831
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the broader corruption of </v>

47
00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>social psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys may know or may not.</v>

48
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:24.471
<v Speaker 1>The social psychology has been rife with</v>
<v Speaker 1>with controversy and scandal over the </v>

49
00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:30.141
<v Speaker 1>last three or four years and a big part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reason for that is it's damn </v>

50
00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Speaker 1>corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Discipline and that use of the iat for </v>

51
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>political reasons is a perfect example </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

52
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>There is no excuse for it and the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>at St Mike's,</v>

53
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:37.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

54
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is scientifically validated.</v>

55
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

56
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:46.041
<v Speaker 1>it's not and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you do have unconscious bias </v>

57
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>just for the sake of argument and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could measure it reliably,</v>

58
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>which you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it was valid,</v>

59
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>which it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say all of those things were in </v>

60
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.121
<v Speaker 1>case there's no evidence whatsoever that</v>
<v Speaker 1>those damn on unconscious bias training </v>

61
00:02:59.121 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retraining programs have the effect that</v>

62
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.240
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to have and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>some evidence that they actually have </v>

63
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.511
<v Speaker 1>the reverse effect and maybe that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people don't really like being </v>

64
00:03:09.511 --> 00:03:12.811
<v Speaker 1>marched off to reeducation by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>employers after they've been diagnosed </v>

65
00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>as racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if there's no evidence that they in</v>

66
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:20.011
<v Speaker 1>fact are so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an absolute misuse of psychology </v>

67
00:03:20.011 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>and it's politically motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's politically motivated.</v>

68
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>It's an assault on freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

69
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.870
<v Speaker 1>I made those two videos and I took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to take the HR and equity people </v>

70
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>at uft to task because they made that </v>
<v Speaker 1>training mandatory for their hr people.</v>

71
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the right as an employer </v>

72
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.280
<v Speaker 1>to invade the unconscious structures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your employee's minds and alter their </v>

73
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>political perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you can't do it.</v>

74
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.600
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the right to do that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about it as something you </v>

75
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.600
<v Speaker 1>should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of course,</v>

76
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.581
<v Speaker 1>as part of your ethical duty is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really want that.</v>

77
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.950
<v Speaker 1>You really want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want your employers to </v>

78
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.441
<v Speaker 1>be able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figure out independently of your </v>

79
00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:05.461
<v Speaker 1>behavior whether or not you're a racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>or classist or or a misogynist or </v>

80
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 1>whatever that happens to be and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really think that the bureaucrats at the</v>

81
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

82
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.070
<v Speaker 1>or bureaucrats anywhere for that matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>are actually capable and qualified of </v>

83
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.961
<v Speaker 1>doing such a thing properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doing far more damage than than any </v>

84
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:21.961
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
