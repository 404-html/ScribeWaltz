1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.150
<v Speaker 1>And by the time the Soviet revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>came around,</v>

2
00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:08.151
<v Speaker 1>which would be at the latter part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 tens after the first world war,</v>

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>the peasant class had actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>established farms,</v>

4
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>varying productivity.</v>

5
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:19.401
<v Speaker 1>Some of the peasant farmers were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good at being farmers and produced </v>

6
00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>a huge proportion of rushes and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine's food.</v>

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things we'll talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this later,</v>

8
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:30.201
<v Speaker 1>as the class progresses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you'll find if </v>

9
00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>that if you look at creative production </v>
<v Speaker 1>in any domain,</v>

10
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Artistic Domain,</v>

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 1>food production novels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>written novel,</v>

12
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money generated,</v>

13
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>number of companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generated,</v>

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>number of goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scored in hockey,</v>

15
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any number of paintings,</v>

16
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>painted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of compositions,</v>

17
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

18
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Where where the fundamental underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure as human productivity,</v>

19
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:58.641
<v Speaker 1>what you find is that a very tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of people produce almost all </v>

20
00:00:58.641 --> 00:00:58.641
<v Speaker 1>of the output.</v>

21
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>It's called a pareto distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>P A r e t o,</v>

22
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 1>and it was studied in detail in </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific productivity by someone named</v>

23
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>does solar price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a square root law.</v>

24
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>So here's the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

25
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the number of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing,</v>

26
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are in a given domain,</v>

27
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:20.691
<v Speaker 1>who are producing in a given domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the square root of the people produce </v>

28
00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>half the product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that means if you have 10 employees,</v>

29
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>three of them do half the work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you have 10,000</v>

30
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 of them do half the work,</v>

31
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

32
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:35.271
<v Speaker 1>very vicious statistic and you won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn about that in psychology for </v>

33
00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:38.841
<v Speaker 1>reasons I have no idea about because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned about the normal distribution </v>

34
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>and not the prieto distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pareto distributions govern,</v>

35
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distribution of money,</v>

36
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.110
<v Speaker 1>which is why one percent of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the general population have the </v>

37
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.551
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming amount of money and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>10th of that one percent has almost all </v>

38
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:52.551
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

39
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's like the richest 100 </v>

40
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>people in the world have as much money </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the bottom two and a half billion and</v>

41
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a terrible thing,</v>

42
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:06.231
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you have to understand is that </v>

43
00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:09.441
<v Speaker 1>that law governs the distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative production across all creative </v>

44
00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

45
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.050
<v Speaker 1>it's something like a natural law and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

46
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about that more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but imagine what happens when you play </v>

47
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've all played monopoly.</v>

48
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>What happens when you play monopoly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One person ends up with all the money,</v>

49
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you play another game of monopoly.</v>

50
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.980
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One person ends up with all the money.</v>

51
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.160
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the inevitable consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of multiple trades that are conducted </v>

52
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 1>randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you take a thousand people and you</v>

53
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:36.570
<v Speaker 1>get them to play a trading game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get each give them $100,</v>

54
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:41.571
<v Speaker 1>say or $10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have to trade with another </v>

55
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:41.571
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

56
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>By flipping a coin I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the coin toss you give me a dollar,</v>

57
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>you win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give you a dollar.</v>

58
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.520
<v Speaker 1>If we all play that long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one person will end up with all the </v>

59
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>money and everyone else will end up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

60
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's a deeply built feature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems of creative production and no </v>

61
00:02:55.951 --> 00:03:00.951
<v Speaker 1>one really knows what to do about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of course the danger is is that </v>

62
00:03:00.951 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>all the resources get funneled to a tiny</v>
<v Speaker 1>minority of people at the top and a huge</v>

63
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>section of the population stacks up at </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

64
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.790
<v Speaker 1>But to blame that on the oppressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of a given system is to radically</v>

65
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>underestimate the complexity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

66
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.500
<v Speaker 1>No one actually knows how to effectively</v>
<v Speaker 1>shovel resources from the minority that </v>

67
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>that controls almost everything to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority.</v>

68
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>That has almost nothing in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent way.</v>

69
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:31.561
<v Speaker 1>Because as you shovel money down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tends to move right back up and it's </v>

70
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:31.561
<v Speaker 1>a big problem.</v>

71
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm telling you about that is</v>

72
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:38.401
<v Speaker 1>because after the peasants were granted </v>
<v Speaker 1>their land and started to become </v>

73
00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tiny minority of them became extremely</v>

74
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:45.811
<v Speaker 1>successful and those people produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all of the food for Russia and </v>

75
00:03:45.811 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened in the 19 twenties when</v>

76
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>bloody lennon came along and </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectivize the farms,</v>

77
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:55.801
<v Speaker 1>was that they defined the Kulaks who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were these tiny minority of successful </v>

78
00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>farmers who maybe had a brick house and </v>
<v Speaker 1>were able to hire a couple of people and</v>

79
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>had some land in some livestock and were</v>
<v Speaker 1>very productive people.</v>

80
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.400
<v Speaker 1>They define them as socially unfriendly </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements and they sent groups of </v>

81
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals out into the towns to </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectivize the farms.</v>

82
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:14.671
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea was that while you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool your land and and everyone would </v>

83
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>farm it collectively and the land was </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken away,</v>

84
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.040
<v Speaker 1>of course from the tiny minority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are actually productive and </v>

85
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>had actually managed to own much of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

86
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 1>So you have to imagine how that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>occur.</v>

87
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's in the 19 twenties,</v>

88
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 1>it's after the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After World War One rushes in pretty bad</v>

89
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:36.661
<v Speaker 1>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The villages are full of brutalized men </v>

90
00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:39.331
<v Speaker 1>who have posttraumatic stress disorder </v>
<v Speaker 1>and lots of people who are not doing </v>

91
00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 1>well at all in the bloody intellectuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>come into the town and they say,</v>

92
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those successful farmers up the street </v>

93
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.110
<v Speaker 1>that you've always been pretty jealous </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in your useless manner while </v>

94
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>they're actually pigs and demons who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing from you.</v>

95
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:56.821
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll form a nice little mob and we'll </v>

96
00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>take everything they've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happened.</v>

97
00:04:57.611 --> 00:05:02.611
<v Speaker 1>And all those people were killed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>raped or set off to Siberia in the </v>

98
00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:04.180
<v Speaker 1>middle of the bloody winter where there </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't even anything for them to.</v>

99
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>To anywhere for them to live or anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to eat.</v>

100
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.240
<v Speaker 1>So they all died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the consequence of that was a </v>

101
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 1>few years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>6 million people starved to death in the</v>

102
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine.</v>
