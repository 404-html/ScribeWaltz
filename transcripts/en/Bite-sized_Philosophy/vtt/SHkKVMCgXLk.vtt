1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.430
<v Speaker 1>And this is what behavior therapists do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decompose your problems.</v>

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.020
<v Speaker 1>What are you afraid of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.970
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid of everything.</v>

4
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get something specific you're </v>

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of an elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>An elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have a client,</v>

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>she's afraid of elevators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The elevator door open.</v>

9
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:18.190
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tube.</v>

10
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.350
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>

11
00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was an elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for you it's not a bloody elevator.</v>

12
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.740
<v Speaker 1>It's death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you're afraid of.</v>

13
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're afraid of being trapped inside </v>

14
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>there in the dark alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>

15
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>not knowing if anyone is going to rescue</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

16
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.270
<v Speaker 1>stuck there with your damn imagination </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking out.</v>

17
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that's not,</v>

18
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.130
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe you have a heart attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're so terrified and you die.</v>

19
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.690
<v Speaker 1>so that's the elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

21
00:00:46.691 --> 00:00:51.691
<v Speaker 1>it's no bloody wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to get into something </v>

22
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:53.761
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe underneath that is your </v>

23
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:53.860
<v Speaker 1>distrust in the mechanisms of society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Because you know a normal person that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was weird creatures,</v>

25
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.280
<v Speaker 1>they'll get an elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell?</v>

26
00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:05.281
<v Speaker 1>They don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly it's because they have an </v>

27
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:05.281
<v Speaker 1>implicit belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the thing stops,</v>

28
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>somebody will come along and rescue them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and usually you don't even think about </v>

29
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

30
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

31
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.960
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an elevator.</v>

32
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>So like</v>

33
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.870
<v Speaker 1>the danger is invisible to you</v>

34
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.250
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly because you implicitly </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust the structure and so maybe you go </v>

35
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.671
<v Speaker 1>into the unconscious presuppositions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who is terrified of the </v>

36
00:01:24.671 --> 00:01:29.141
<v Speaker 1>elevator in the subways and you find out</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a real problem with trusting </v>

37
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:32.441
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why they don't get along </v>

38
00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:32.720
<v Speaker 1>with her husband and why they'd never </v>
<v Speaker 1>been able to stand up for themselves.</v>

39
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.640
<v Speaker 1>So then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

40
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:36.170
<v Speaker 1>while you're afraid of the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevator,</v>

41
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:37.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's not an elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tomb.</v>

42
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
<v Speaker 1>And the tomb is partly you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly it's partly the elevator and </v>

43
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.360
<v Speaker 1>partly your unconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so well,</v>

44
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:49.361
<v Speaker 1>what can you handle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you go and look at an elevator from </v>

45
00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:49.361
<v Speaker 1>10 feet away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

46
00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:50.240
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>How about nine feet away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

48
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Five feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four feet?</v>

49
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.700
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

50
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four and a half feet.</v>

51
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:02.411
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go from that elevator and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to look at the damn thing </v>

52
00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>until you're bored of it because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're trying to.</v>

53
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.580
<v Speaker 1>You should be board of the elevator </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you're not afraid of it.</v>

54
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an elevator.</v>

55
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>You just don't notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

56
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>All of these things around here that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't notice.</v>

57
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I'd take you out of here and ask you </v>
<v Speaker 1>what color the walls are.</v>

58
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:18.770
<v Speaker 1>You haven't got any idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

59
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect for most of you,</v>

60
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:25.811
<v Speaker 1>there's not a chance you'd be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify the gender of the person who's </v>

61
00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:26.780
<v Speaker 1>sitting next to you unless you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

62
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like you just don't remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and why should you?</v>

63
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Everything works like you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to it.</v>

64
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

65
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>does that stay up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

66
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>it's still up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Still up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still up.</v>

68
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.840
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

69
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>you get bored of that real quick and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you just ignore it and.</v>

71
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>But the agoraphobic has had that veil of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance torn away and what they see </v>

72
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.400
<v Speaker 1>behind it is mortal threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really what you're helping</v>

73
00:02:55.401 --> 00:03:00.401
<v Speaker 1>them deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this week there are four and a </v>

74
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:03.791
<v Speaker 1>half from the elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next week they're a foot from the </v>

75
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:05.971
<v Speaker 1>elevator and the week after that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible gates of hell opened and they </v>

76
00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 1>look inside and they don't run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

77
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:12.571
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're tougher than they thought they </v>

78
00:03:12.571 --> 00:03:12.571
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're teaching them.</v>

79
00:03:12.571 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Actually you're not teaching them that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world isn't dangerous because that's</v>

80
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:17.140
<v Speaker 1>a stupid thing to teach someone bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

81
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>The world is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying.</v>

82
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.720
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes people under a realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and the veil lifts and they see </v>

83
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>horror everywhere.</v>

84
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>They see that and then they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

85
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a little rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm over here in the corner.</v>

86
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm petrified.</v>

87
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 1>And then they can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hide it home.</v>

88
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 1>The cower at home because everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a predatory domain.</v>

89
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>And so what you teach them is you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much of a rabbit as you think.</v>

90
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And part of that is that you help them </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>

91
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:51.931
<v Speaker 1>Some teeth so that they can go home and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that fight with their husband that </v>

92
00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>they should have had 25 years ago and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens very frequently with agoraphobic</v>

93
00:03:55.211 --> 00:04:00.211
<v Speaker 1>clients that you get them so they can go</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the damn elevator and they can go on </v>

94
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>the subway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can take a taxi.</v>

95
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 1>It maybe they learn to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

96
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.090
<v Speaker 1>That gets some autonomy and then they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little tougher and so then they can </v>

97
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>stand up for themselves and they go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like their husband might not be very</v>

98
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>happy with any of this really.</v>

99
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what sort of guy he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

100
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:20.851
<v Speaker 1>if he's a real tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might be just perfectly happy that </v>

101
00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>he's married to someone who was afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of her own shadow because then she won't</v>

102
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.050
<v Speaker 1>ever leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a nasty little story and </v>

103
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not uncommon.</v>

104
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.660
<v Speaker 1>So she gets tougher by facing what she </v>
<v Speaker 1>fears and what she finds out is there's </v>

105
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.840
<v Speaker 1>a hell of a lot more to her than she </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

106
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what happens when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do behavior therapy with someone who's </v>

107
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.290
<v Speaker 1>agoraphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't really that they get less </v>

108
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.290
<v Speaker 1>afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that they get braver.</v>

109
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.970
<v Speaker 1>That's way different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because brave is alert and able to </v>

110
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>cope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naive is there's no danger.</v>

111
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have right?</v>

112
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 1>There's no danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

113
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 1>What a stupid theory that is.</v>
