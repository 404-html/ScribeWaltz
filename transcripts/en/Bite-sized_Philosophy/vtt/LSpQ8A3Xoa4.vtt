1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Fully believed that the fundamental myth</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human being was the myth and the </v>

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>myth from a broader perspective is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>failed hero's story,</v>

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>so the eatable myth is the myth of a man</v>
<v Speaker 1>who develops who grows up,</v>

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>but then accidentally becomes too close </v>
<v Speaker 1>to his mother,</v>

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>sleeps with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know who she is,</v>

6
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>and as a consequence blinds himself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a.</v>

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a warning about human </v>

8
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>development going wrong in that story </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that Freud put his finger on</v>

9
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:39.591
<v Speaker 1>it extraordinarily well because human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have a very long period of </v>

10
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:44.031
<v Speaker 1>dependency and one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do see in clinical practice is that </v>

11
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:48.800
<v Speaker 1>many people's problems are associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their inability to break free of </v>

12
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:54.921
<v Speaker 1>their family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're consumed by the family </v>

13
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:54.921
<v Speaker 1>drama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>They can't get beyond what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in their family.</v>

15
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>They're stuck in the past.</v>

16
00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>that's equivalent symbolically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say to the idea of being too </v>

18
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>close to your mother of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

19
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 1>of the boundaries being improperly </v>
<v Speaker 1>specified,</v>

20
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>and that happens far more often than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone would like to think.</v>

21
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for I thought it was a universal,</v>

22
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>but you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a different idea and his idea was</v>

23
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>that it wasn't the failed hero story </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the universal human myth.</v>

24
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>It was the successful hero's story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big difference.</v>

25
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I could seriously a big difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the successful hero story is </v>

26
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.960
<v Speaker 1>member in sleeping beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may remember this in the Disney </v>

27
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.541
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evil queen traps the prince in a </v>

28
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>dungeon and she's not gonna let them out</v>
<v Speaker 1>till he's old.</v>

29
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:50.031
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this comical scene where </v>

30
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>she's down in the dungeon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's all in chains and she's laughing at</v>

31
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:55.791
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling him what his future is going to </v>

32
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:55.791
<v Speaker 1>be like.</v>

33
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>She's quite evil and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

34
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 1>she paints this wonderful picture of him</v>
<v Speaker 1>being freed in like 80 years and </v>

35
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.440
<v Speaker 1>hobbling out of the castle on his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his horse that's so old,</v>

36
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:05.530
<v Speaker 1>he can barely stand up in him with gray </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

37
00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

38
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:11.631
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she recites this story of his eventual </v>

39
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>triumphant departure from the castle as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a old and decrepit man.</v>

40
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>And she has a great laugh about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nice.</v>

41
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real punchy story.</v>

42
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.670
<v Speaker 1>It's really something wonderful for </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

43
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.770
<v Speaker 1>that story and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets free of the,</v>

44
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.730
<v Speaker 1>of the shackles and the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom or three little female ferries,</v>

45
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>the positive aspect of the feminine that</v>
<v Speaker 1>frees him from the dungeon.</v>

46
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.770
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting and very accurate </v>

47
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.401
<v Speaker 1>from a psychological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the negative element of the </v>

48
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>feminine that encapsulates him in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dungeon and it's the positive element of</v>

49
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>the feminine that frees him.</v>

50
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.720
<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a queen.</v>

51
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>The Evil Queen is not very happy when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>escapes.</v>

52
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:56.421
<v Speaker 1>You may remember that she stands on top </v>
<v Speaker 1>of her castle tower and starts to spin </v>

53
00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>off cosmic sparks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

54
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:02.871
<v Speaker 1>she's quite the creature in opt in flame</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then she turns into a dragon and she</v>

55
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:07.981
<v Speaker 1>then the prince has to fight with her in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to make contact with sleeping </v>

56
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:13.651
<v Speaker 1>beauty and an awakened her from her </v>
<v Speaker 1>comatose existence as her unconscious </v>

57
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.951
<v Speaker 1>existence and a wants a brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant representation of a </v>

58
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>successful hero myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

59
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.340
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't end up staying in an unholy </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with his mother.</v>

60
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Let's say he escapes and then conquers </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst thing that can be imagined and</v>

61
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>is ennobled by that and that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences able to wake the slumbering</v>

62
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:50.491
<v Speaker 1>feminine from its coma and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>union story and that's the story that he</v>

63
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:56.461
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposed against Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought of religious phenomena as </v>

64
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 1>part of an old cult tide.</v>

65
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>That would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would drown rationale rationality.</v>

66
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>That's why Freud was so valiantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>antireligious and you thought,</v>

67
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the case.</v>

68
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>You're throwing the baby out with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bathwater.</v>

69
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.650
<v Speaker 1>There's something profound and central </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the hero myth and union clinical work</v>

70
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:24.631
<v Speaker 1>is essentially the awakening of the hero</v>
<v Speaker 1>myth in the in the analysis and in the </v>

71
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>in the client or the patient to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize yourself as that which can</v>

72
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:35.641
<v Speaker 1>confront chaos and triumph and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with an ennobling of </v>

73
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 1>the Sea of consciousness and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment of pop.</v>

74
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Proper positive relationships between </v>
<v Speaker 1>male and female.</v>

75
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a skeptical person.</v>

76
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very skeptical person and I've tried </v>

77
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.771
<v Speaker 1>with every trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to put a lever underneath young </v>

78
00:04:55.771 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>story and lifted up and disrupt it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

79
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was right and that Freud was </v>

80
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

81
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have great respect for Freud.</v>

82
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I think he got the progam problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed very,</v>

83
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:12.250
<v Speaker 1>very nicely and in my clinical work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see the phenomena that Freud described</v>

84
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>emerge continually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly that the best.</v>

85
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a documentary you should watch.</v>

86
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:23.581
<v Speaker 1>I may have mentioned it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the best documentary ever </v>

87
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:23.581
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly the best one I've ever seen.</v>

88
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>It's called crumb and it's about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>underground cartoonists.</v>

89
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Robert Crumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

90
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>who was part of the hippie movement in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he hated hippies,</v>

91
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>he was part of the hippie movement in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sixties,</v>

92
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:40.201
<v Speaker 1>in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and started the entire underground </v>

93
00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:41.680
<v Speaker 1>comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What culture that that manifested itself</v>

94
00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 1>eventually in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in graphic novels,</v>

95
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.440
<v Speaker 1>there's quite a significant figure from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the perspective of popular art and a </v>

96
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.720
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very intelligent man and also I would </v>

97
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.391
<v Speaker 1>say a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although a very bent and depraved and </v>

98
00:05:57.391 --> 00:05:57.391
<v Speaker 1>warped one.</v>

99
00:05:57.391 --> 00:06:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Someone very acutely aware of his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow and the documentary outlines his </v>

100
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.720
<v Speaker 1>attempts to escape from his absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreadful mother and the failure of his </v>

101
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:14.381
<v Speaker 1>two brothers to do the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of whom ended up as a street beggar </v>

102
00:06:14.381 --> 00:06:18.491
<v Speaker 1>in San Francisco and the other who drank</v>
<v Speaker 1>furniture Polish and died six months </v>

103
00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:21.761
<v Speaker 1>after the documentary was produced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievably shocking </v>

104
00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:25.450
<v Speaker 1>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only piece of film that I've </v>

105
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.880
<v Speaker 1>ever seen that captures Friday and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology.</v>

106
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't see it generally,</v>

107
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>unless you're in a clinical situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you know the details of someone's</v>

108
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personal intimate details,</v>

109
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.760
<v Speaker 1>you cannot communicate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the documentary who made the film </v>

110
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>was Robert's way golf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

111
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.840
<v Speaker 1>was a friend of the crumbs and so he got</v>
<v Speaker 1>access in a way that no one else would </v>

112
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 1>have and they're also very forthright </v>
<v Speaker 1>and forthcoming about their situation in</v>

113
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

114
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I would highly recommend that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real punch.</v>

115
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:01.390
<v Speaker 1>If you want to know how a rapist thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you actually want to know </v>
