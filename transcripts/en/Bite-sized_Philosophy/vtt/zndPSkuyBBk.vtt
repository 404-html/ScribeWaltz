00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.140
<v Speaker 1>in the past I've done some work with big</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>

3
00:00:03.141 --> 00:00:04.790
<v Speaker 1>big sister and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.820
<v Speaker 1>that being said that the most common </v>
<v Speaker 1>story I tend to hear from 50 youth is </v>

5
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>that they're raised in a single family </v>
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

6
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>usually with a mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>daddy's there on the picture and </v>

7
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

8
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.811
<v Speaker 1>whatever they brought her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have this child who is trying to </v>

9
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.090
<v Speaker 1>seek ways to make himself healthy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>empower himself in ways that a healthy </v>

10
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>father should have done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

11
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the formative years of like one </v>

12
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.910
<v Speaker 1>to four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

13
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going with this,</v>

14
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

15
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.980
<v Speaker 1>let's say for someone who born without </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a good father figure,</v>

16
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>where would they go out in the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what four spheres of influence </v>

17
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.401
<v Speaker 1>where they try to expose themselves to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like gain access to that Fountain of </v>

18
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Health and knowledge at a father or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good father figure should have provide </v>

19
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.950
<v Speaker 1>them to in the first place.</v>

20
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

21
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.290
<v Speaker 2>partly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean certainly to some degree a good </v>

22
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.561
<v Speaker 2>mother can provide that to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's hard for one person to be </v>

23
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 2>everything right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

24
00:00:56.511 --> 00:00:58.750
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the conundrums that </v>
<v Speaker 2>face women,</v>

25
00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 2>and this is a tough one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is why I think women are higher</v>

26
00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 2>end trade agreeableness and higher in </v>
<v Speaker 2>trait negative emotion,</v>

27
00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:08.611
<v Speaker 2>is that the primary problem that a woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>has with an infant is why not throw it </v>

28
00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:12.610
<v Speaker 2>out a window because it's very annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's there all the time.</v>

29
00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:15.340
<v Speaker 2>It's constant demand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely constantly man,</v>

30
00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:20.341
<v Speaker 2>tremendous dependency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so a woman has to be tilted towards </v>

31
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 2>mercy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it looks to me like.</v>

32
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.730
<v Speaker 2>And especially during.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so important during the.</v>

33
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Especially the first year when children </v>
<v Speaker 2>are so unbelievably vulnerable.</v>

34
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 2>And so I think it's very difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 2>women to be merciful like that and to </v>

35
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.390
<v Speaker 2>make the shift to encouraging </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplinary.</v>

36
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.280
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a very difficult thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people to do simultaneously.</v>

37
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Although you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

38
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that women are always </v>

39
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.020
<v Speaker 2>only merciful and men are always only </v>
<v Speaker 2>encouraging disciplinarians,</v>

40
00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:50.050
<v Speaker 2>but things do sort themselves out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree like that.</v>

41
00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:54.130
<v Speaker 2>And I think also the biochemical </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformations that accompany pregnancy</v>

42
00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:58.570
<v Speaker 2>and childbirth and lactation also killed</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mother towards that as well because he</v>

43
00:01:58.571 --> 00:02:00.370
<v Speaker 2>has to really love that little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

44
00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:01.990
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's number one,</v>

45
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:06.991
<v Speaker 2>no matter what it demands and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling it what to do and making sure </v>

46
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 2>it's behaving properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

47
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.080
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different issue now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the kids who lack fathers,</v>

48
00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:12.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

49
00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:17.761
<v Speaker 2>they can find that to some degree in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their friends and that's often what </v>

50
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:17.761
<v Speaker 2>father this boys do in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

51
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:20.680
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go into gangs and they generate the</v>

52
00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:22.750
<v Speaker 2>missing men masculinity and the game.</v>

53
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not so good because like </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell do they know that?</v>

54
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know anything,</v>

55
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:32.251
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just stupid kids and they're </v>

56
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:32.410
<v Speaker 2>like 15 years old and their testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 2>is pumping and they're trying to get the</v>

57
00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:34.570
<v Speaker 2>hell away from their mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what they're supposed to do.</v>

58
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.370
<v Speaker 2>And they're not in the right position to</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise authority over themselves.</v>

59
00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:42.430
<v Speaker 2>So that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can find it in education,</v>

60
00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 2>they can find it in books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can find it.</v>

61
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can find it in sports heroes and so</v>

62
00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:51.811
<v Speaker 2>forth because the image of the father is</v>
<v Speaker 2>fragmented and distributed among the </v>

63
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:52.270
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very,</v>

64
00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:55.180
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to not have a father and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

65
00:02:55.181 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that we're doing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our society,</v>

66
00:02:56.921 --> 00:03:01.921
<v Speaker 2>which I think is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's absolutely is that we're </v>

67
00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 2>making the case that all families are </v>
<v Speaker 2>equal.</v>

68
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

69
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.690
<v Speaker 2>no wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no empirical data supporting </v>

70
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.690
<v Speaker 2>that proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

71
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 2>It's much better for kids to have two </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents who those parents are.</v>

72
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole different issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I could just one more thing.</v>

73
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you ask that question too?</v>

74
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.100
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A daughter who was raised by a father </v>

75
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.961
<v Speaker 2>because she would obviously have </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways of find those fragments </v>

76
00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:27.781
<v Speaker 2>of her missing father then like a boy </v>
<v Speaker 2>would instead because obviously they're </v>

77
00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:27.781
<v Speaker 2>raised differently or at least they </v>
<v Speaker 2>should have been.</v>

78
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the same issue,</v>

79
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

80
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that another danger that </v>

81
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.531
<v Speaker 2>emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mrs [inaudible] of course famous </v>

82
00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:39.451
<v Speaker 2>observation is that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's mom and child or father and </v>

83
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:44.461
<v Speaker 2>child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that relationship can get a little </v>

84
00:03:44.461 --> 00:03:46.231
<v Speaker 2>closer than it should and then the lines</v>
<v Speaker 2>get blurry and mixed and I'm not saying </v>

85
00:03:46.231 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 2>that that happens to everyone obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

86
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's still a danger that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>inherent in the situation.</v>

87
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.810
<v Speaker 2>They're were thrust together too tightly</v>
<v Speaker 2>without sufficient resources and so the </v>

88
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.561
<v Speaker 2>responsibility has to be distributed </v>
<v Speaker 2>more and like I really do think that </v>

89
00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 2>it's the sign of the degeneration of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>society when the,</v>

90
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.940
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when single parenthood becomes anything </v>

91
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 2>approximating the norm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good idea.</v>

92
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Then the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm part of the reason I believe that </v>

93
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.330
<v Speaker 2>and I think this has to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming selfishness of,</v>

94
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.520
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of modern life is that marriage isn't </v>

95
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 2>for the people who were married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for the children obviously,</v>

96
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.960
<v Speaker 2>and like if you can't handle that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grow the hell up Sarah.</v>

97
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

98
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously.</v>

99
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Once you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you have kids,</v>

100
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not about you,</v>

101
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

102
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean it isn't about you at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

103
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.070
<v Speaker 2>but it just seems so self evident to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that anybody would even </v>

104
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.840
<v Speaker 2>would even question it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

105
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 2>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

106
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly aware of that.</v>

107
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's questioned.</v>

108
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 2>It's almost illegal to question it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

109
00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to or illegal to make the set of </v>

110
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.911
<v Speaker 2>propositions that I make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the best I can do.</v>

111
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.930
<v Speaker 2>That's excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
