1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I worked with this crazy psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>he used to put jokes on is multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice tests.</v>

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>He was a really eccentric guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really liked his courses.</v>

4
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:16.101
<v Speaker 1>He and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he taught a course on creativity and he </v>

5
00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:19.071
<v Speaker 1>was also a prison psychologist and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was an eccentric guy and he for some </v>

6
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:22.110
<v Speaker 1>reason liked me and maybe because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>eccentric to and he invited me to go out</v>

7
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>to the Edmonton maximum security prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them a couple of times,</v>

8
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:29.721
<v Speaker 1>which I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a very interesting </v>

9
00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:31.881
<v Speaker 1>experience because I was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what role each individual's </v>

10
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>behavior bore to the pathology of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>group with something like that.</v>

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>And I went out there and I met with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>little guy smaller than me.</v>

12
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.840
<v Speaker 1>I was a little bigger by then and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pretty innocuous guy.</v>

13
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what had happened was I was out in this </v>

14
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>gymnasium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a high school.</v>

15
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>The prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really quite telling in my </v>

16
00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

17
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>and there were all these like monsters </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their weightlifting and like they </v>

18
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.591
<v Speaker 1>were monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember one guy who was tattooed </v>

19
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:06.591
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and he had like a huge scar </v>
<v Speaker 1>running down the middle of his chest.</v>

20
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>It looked like someone had to hit them </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an ax and you know,</v>

21
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:14.081
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was in there and I had this Weird </v>

22
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:16.341
<v Speaker 1>Cape that I used to wear that I bought </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Portugal and some boots that went </v>

23
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:16.341
<v Speaker 1>along with it.</v>

24
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like an 1890 sherlock Holmes Cape</v>

25
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>and it was really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was from the 18 nineties because this</v>

26
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:28.311
<v Speaker 1>little village was up on a hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a walled city on a hill and they </v>

27
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:30.360
<v Speaker 1>sold these things and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've changed the style since 1890.</v>

28
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought they were really cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I was wearing that,</v>

29
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:37.821
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't perhaps the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative garb to dawn if you're </v>

30
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:46.131
<v Speaker 1>going to wear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to go to a maximum </v>

31
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:46.131
<v Speaker 1>security prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

32
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>I was in the gymnasium and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>

33
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>the psychologist left and God only </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows.</v>

34
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what he was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all these guys came around.</v>

35
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>All these guys came around me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:55.321 --> 00:02:00.321
<v Speaker 1>and they were offering to trade their </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison clothes for my cape and he was </v>

37
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was being made an offer I couldn't </v>

38
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>refuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>and so I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really know what to do.</v>

40
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>And then this little guy said something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

41
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>the psychologist sent me to come and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take you away or something like that.</v>

42
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well better this little guy then all </v>

43
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>these monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we went outside the gym through some </v>

44
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like school doors,</v>

45
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>went outside the gym into the exercise </v>
<v Speaker 1>yard I guess,</v>

46
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:33.141
<v Speaker 1>and we're wandering along and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to me and he seemed like a kind </v>

47
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:35.931
<v Speaker 1>of an innocuous guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the psychologist showed up at </v>

48
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:36.120
<v Speaker 1>the door and motioned us back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

49
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.450
<v Speaker 1>which was kind of a relief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I went into his office and he </v>

50
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.450
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>that guy that you walked out in the yard</v>
<v Speaker 1>with?</v>

52
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

53
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 1>He said he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.940
<v Speaker 1>he took two cops one night and he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>them kneel down and while they were </v>

55
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.631
<v Speaker 1>begging for their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he shot them both in the back of the </v>

56
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:53.631
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

57
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:54.020
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

58
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.590
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the thing that was so interesting </v>

59
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>was that he was so innocuous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Because what you'd hope is that someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that would be very much unlike you,</v>

61
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.100
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and certainly wouldn't be like somewhat </v>

62
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>innocuous that you'd met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you'd want is that the guy would be</v>

63
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:16.951
<v Speaker 1>like half world wolf and half vampire so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just tell right away that he </v>

64
00:03:16.951 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>was a cold blooded killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

65
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:23.071
<v Speaker 1>he was this sort of ineffectual little </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who was certainly not ineffectual if</v>

66
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>you gave them a revolver and the upper </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

67
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that made me think that made me think</v>

68
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>a lot about the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>being innocuous and being dangerous.</v>

69
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:38.671
<v Speaker 1>And then another thing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met another guy out there and then a </v>

70
00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:42.990
<v Speaker 1>week or two later I heard that he and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend of his had held another guy down </v>

71
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>and pulverized his left leg with a lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>pipe,</v>

72
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 1>like just pulverized it.</v>

73
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.150
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that was that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that he was a snitch and maybe </v>

74
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>he was and that that time I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something different and instead of being</v>

75
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 1>shocked and horrified by that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I certainly was,</v>

76
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how in the world could you do that?</v>

77
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Because I didn't think I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

78
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that there was a qualitative </v>

79
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.181
<v Speaker 1>distinction between me and those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I spent about two weeks trying to</v>

80
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 1>see if I could figure out under what </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions I could do that.</v>

81
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation I would have to undergo </v>

82
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>to be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was a meditative exercise,</v>

83
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it only took about 10 days for me to</v>

84
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:33.001
<v Speaker 1>realize that not only could I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would be a hell of a lot easier </v>

85
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:33.001
<v Speaker 1>than I thought it would be.</v>

86
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of where that wall between</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and what you described is the shadow </v>

87
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.890
<v Speaker 1>started to fall apart and that also was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very useful because I started to.</v>

88
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.430
<v Speaker 1>I started to treat myself as somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>different entity because I hadn't been </v>

89
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 1>aware up to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:53.071
<v Speaker 1>because I thought I was a good guy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason for me to think that </v>

91
00:04:53.071 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 1>because you're not a good guy unless you</v>
<v Speaker 1>really made a bloody effort to be a good</v>

92
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just not.</v>

93
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy and so you're probably a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moderately bad guy and that's a long </v>

94
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:03.760
<v Speaker 1>ways from being an absolutely horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

95
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a long ways from being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good guy.</v>

96
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:11.341
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had a little more respect for </v>

97
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:13.351
<v Speaker 1>myself after that because I also </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood that there was a monstrous </v>

98
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:18.421
<v Speaker 1>element to the human psyche that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you needed to respect and that was </v>

99
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.690
<v Speaker 1>part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you should regard yourself in some </v>

100
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.121
<v Speaker 1>sense as a loaded weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very useful around children to </v>

101
00:05:27.121 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>regard yourself as a loaded weapon </v>
<v Speaker 1>because around children you are a loaded</v>

102
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:33.541
<v Speaker 1>weapon and the terrible experiences that</v>
<v Speaker 1>many children have with their parents </v>

103
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>are testament to that.</v>
