1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about a comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative is it can't leave out and </v>

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.250
<v Speaker 1>archetipal character or it fails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you an example of this.</v>

3
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:13.251
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how many of you have seen Disney </v>

4
00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 1>sleeping beauty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many of you have.</v>

6
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:18.130
<v Speaker 1>How many Harvard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a few that happened while the</v>

8
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Disney movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of standard childhood fairy</v>
<v Speaker 1>in sleeping beauty.</v>

10
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:29.991
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that the king and queen </v>
<v Speaker 1>give birth to a princess after trying </v>

11
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 1>for a substantial amount of time and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

12
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.890
<v Speaker 1>she arrives healthy and beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they have a christening day and </v>

13
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>they invite everybody to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't invite maleficent who's a</v>

14
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which roughly speaking,</v>

15
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she's,</v>

16
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:45.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's queen of the underworld that for,</v>

17
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the negative element of femininity</v>

18
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>and they don't invite her to the party.</v>

19
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.690
<v Speaker 1>And so she shows up anyways and says </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because they didn't invite her,</v>

20
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>their daughters going to die when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she had 16,</v>

21
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 1>which is roughly the age of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

22
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>sexual maturation for a story of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort.</v>

23
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Now there's another little positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>magic female in the story who mitigates </v>

24
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:19.341
<v Speaker 1>that death sentence to protracted sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the idea behind it,</v>

25
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting story.</v>

26
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:29.031
<v Speaker 1>It's an incredible story in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what it says is that if your </v>

27
00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>parents protect you too much from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark side of life when you're young,</v>

28
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.710
<v Speaker 1>that what will happen when you start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the road to maturity is you'll be so </v>

29
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:43.971
<v Speaker 1>naive and so fragile that you'll want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be unconscious instead of paying </v>

30
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:49.131
<v Speaker 1>attention and that you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be rescued from that state by </v>

31
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:53.361
<v Speaker 1>something and it could be a prince,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one which is how that story </v>

32
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:53.361
<v Speaker 1>plays itself out.</v>

33
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Or it also could be the symbolically </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine and exploratory element of </v>

34
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:03.561
<v Speaker 1>your own psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the stories are ambivalent about </v>

35
00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>whether it's an external event or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intern with and it doesn't really </v>

36
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

38
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>the things ended up being the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's actually what happens in </v>

39
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.220
<v Speaker 1>this sleeping beauty story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:17.221
<v Speaker 1>at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a prince who's also enslaved by this </v>

41
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:22.010
<v Speaker 1>terrible negative feminine force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manages to escape and the maleficent </v>

42
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.190
<v Speaker 1>turns into a dragon and he has to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>her and then he goes and rescues the </v>

43
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.881
<v Speaker 1>princess and she wakes up and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kingdoms rejuvenated and everybody's </v>

44
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic classic story,</v>

45
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not.</v>

46
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because the Disney movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>frozen was put forward as a,</v>

47
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.250
<v Speaker 1>in some sense as a feminist alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the classic fairytales.</v>

48
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>And first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

49
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>You can't just generate a fairytale.</v>

50
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's recent evidence that some of </v>

51
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.420
<v Speaker 1>these fairytales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that the grimm brothers and the</v>

52
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>and Hans Christian Andersen collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>are up to 10,000</v>

53
00:02:55.351 --> 00:03:00.351
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just come up with a counter </v>

54
00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:00.351
<v Speaker 1>fairytale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

55
00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:04.460
<v Speaker 1>that's just not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that fairy tale is </v>

56
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing to do with,</v>

57
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>with the necessity for anyone to rely on</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else for anything.</v>

58
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a complex portrayal of the denied </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic relationship between archetypal </v>

59
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

60
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:24.031
<v Speaker 1>it's one form of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of different forms of the </v>

61
00:03:24.031 --> 00:03:27.331
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I liked about sleeping beauty </v>

62
00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:27.331
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mrs,</v>

63
00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>what's Nice about the real fairy tales </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that along with the positive there is</v>

64
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:35.611
<v Speaker 1>negative and it's real negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like real fairy tales are terrified and </v>

65
00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>like I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is it?</v>

66
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Is it sleeping beauty or in Snow White,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

67
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.780
<v Speaker 1>In one of the famous grimm fairy tales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the evil sisters ends up dancing </v>

68
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>and red hot shoes until she dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

69
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>

70
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>very violent and and unsettling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's because they,</v>

71
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:58.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the quality of genuine folk </v>

72
00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:00.751
<v Speaker 1>tales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason for that is because </v>

73
00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:02.251
<v Speaker 1>they're dealing with real things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hansel and Gretel story is a good </v>

74
00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:02.251
<v Speaker 1>example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

75
00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Kids are abandoned out in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find something that's too good to </v>

76
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.381
<v Speaker 1>be true inside this thing that's too </v>
<v Speaker 1>good to be true is something that wants </v>

77
00:04:10.381 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>to fatten them up and devour them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a rough story,</v>

78
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.210
<v Speaker 1>but what it's doing at the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories have evolved to represent </v>

79
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental dynamic elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

80
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.090
<v Speaker 1>If you conceptualize existence in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

81
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.330
<v Speaker 1>in terms of character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is you have to </v>

82
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.000
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize existence in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>character if you're a person because </v>

83
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.140
<v Speaker 1>what you do in existence is act out your</v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

84
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.770
<v Speaker 1>so your character is an element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

85
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that doesn't mean that society has </v>

86
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.401
<v Speaker 1>a character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually it does mean that because </v>

87
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 1>partly what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're a socialized,</v>

88
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.100
<v Speaker 1>say into a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture exists in the same </v>

89
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 1>relationship to you roughly speaking as </v>
<v Speaker 1>another person does.</v>

90
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put money in the bank,</v>

91
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 1>which is in principle a representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your labor.</v>

92
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing is entering into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract with the broader social world,</v>

93
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:11.311
<v Speaker 1>which is one of promise essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the future society promises to </v>

94
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.270
<v Speaker 1>return your value at a future date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a contractual relationship and </v>

95
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.180
<v Speaker 1>the reason that God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the father is a very common </v>

96
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.091
<v Speaker 1>representation is because treating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>they in in Heideggerian terms,</v>

97
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.360
<v Speaker 1>the others in Heideggerian terms as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're an embodied entity actually </v>

98
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:34.810
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
