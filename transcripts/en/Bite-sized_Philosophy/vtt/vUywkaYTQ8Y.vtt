1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.690
<v Speaker 1>What should move forward in time with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what should be let go as if it's </v>

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>dead wood and the more dead wood that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you let go of and burn off when you have</v>

3
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last it accretes around you here.</v>

4
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Here's something interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest fires.</v>

5
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>You know people have been trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent forest fires for a long time,</v>

6
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>especially that am bear smokey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:25.491
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to prevent forest fires and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so because forest fires burn up the </v>

8
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>forest and that can't be good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's what happens if you don't let</v>

9
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:34.551
<v Speaker 1>forest fires burned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that while forests collect a lot of </v>

10
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>dry branches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Because tree branches die and would </v>
<v Speaker 1>falls on the forest floor and collects </v>

12
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:46.761
<v Speaker 1>and so the amount of flammable material </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps increasing with time and that's </v>

13
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:53.061
<v Speaker 1>not so bad if it's wet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the amount of flammable material </v>

14
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>is increasing and it gets really dry and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it burns,</v>

15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>then you have a real problem.</v>

16
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>The forest fire can burn so hot that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>burns route,</v>

17
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>topsoil right off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case you don't have a forest at</v>

18
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:07.670
<v Speaker 1>all anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have a desert and low.</v>

19
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Lots of trees are evolved to withstand </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest fires,</v>

20
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:15.921
<v Speaker 1>have a certain intensity and some won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even release their seeds unless there's </v>

21
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:20.661
<v Speaker 1>been a fire and so a little bit of fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the right time can stop everything </v>

22
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>from burning to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's also a really useful insight,</v>

23
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>a metaphorical insight into the nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sacrifice,</v>

24
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:33.801
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a lot easier to let go of </v>

25
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:36.471
<v Speaker 1>something when you're deciding to let go</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it because you've decided yourself </v>

26
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>that you're done with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weak part of you.</v>

27
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 1>It needs to disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do that yourself.</v>

28
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>It's much better and much easier than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is if it's taken away from you forcibly,</v>

29
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>in which case you're very much likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight it.</v>

30
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.230
<v Speaker 1>These other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another interesting thing here,</v>

31
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>a motif that runs through the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bible.</v>

32
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:58.911
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful motif and it's partly </v>

33
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:01.461
<v Speaker 1>associated with this idea of walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>with or walking before God and in the </v>

34
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ says something like,</v>

35
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>my father's will be done and he means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that will should be done through </v>

36
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I can't.</v>

37
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I won't be able to state this exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

38
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:21.441
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what people regard as their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities and and are proud of about</v>

40
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>their own personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't their own personalities at all.</v>

41
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:29.301
<v Speaker 1>They're useless idiosyncrasies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>defer them,</v>

42
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>differentiate them trivially from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

43
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>but they have no value in and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

44
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:39.681
<v Speaker 1>They're more like quirks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember once I was trying to teach a </v>

45
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:43.521
<v Speaker 1>particularly stubborn student about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to write and she had written a number of</v>

46
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:50.331
<v Speaker 1>essays in university and got universally</v>
<v Speaker 1>walloped for them and the reason for </v>

47
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>that was she couldn't write really at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

48
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:58.371
<v Speaker 1>She was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad at writing and so I was </v>

49
00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:02.211
<v Speaker 1>sitting down with her trying to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>to her what she was doing wrong and she </v>

50
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>was being very annoying about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very recalcitrant,</v>

51
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unwilling to listen.</v>

52
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>That was a pearls before swine thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>and at one point she said it did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can write perfectly well,</v>

54
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:19.501
<v Speaker 1>this university professors just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like my style and I could feel my hands </v>

55
00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>creep towards her neck.</v>

56
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that'd be funny if it wasn't </v>

57
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was also true,</v>

58
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought what the Hell is with you?</v>

59
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.420
<v Speaker 1>You can't even write and you think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a style and not only do you.</v>

60
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

61
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.300
<v Speaker 1>not knowing how to write is not a style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other point.</v>

62
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

63
00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:47.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

64
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.180
<v Speaker 1>she instead of humbling herself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was necessary and.</v>

65
00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

66
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.100
<v Speaker 1>because she was a new university </v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

67
00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:54.450
<v Speaker 1>like of course you don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write.</v>

68
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:56.100
<v Speaker 1>When were you going to learn in school?</v>

69
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.170
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

70
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.940
<v Speaker 1>So she had this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:06.750
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

72
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.150
<v Speaker 1>this style issue in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

73
00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:12.270
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't go anywhere at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now,</v>

74
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.310
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost my train of thought telling you,</v>

75
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.500
<v Speaker 1>telling you all those jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't we asked in terms of above letting</v>

76
00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:20.700
<v Speaker 1>things burn off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:04:20.701 --> 00:04:25.701
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she was proud of her insufficiency </v>

78
00:04:25.701 --> 00:04:25.701
<v Speaker 1>outs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrogance,</v>

79
00:04:25.701 --> 00:04:25.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not humility.</v>

80
00:04:25.701 --> 00:04:28.560
<v Speaker 1>It's self deception and arrogance to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>proud of your insufficiency.</v>

81
00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:33.561
<v Speaker 1>That's a very foolish thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means to cling to the parts of </v>

82
00:04:33.561 --> 00:04:33.561
<v Speaker 1>you that are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

83
00:04:33.561 --> 00:04:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Now there's this idea that runs through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible,</v>

84
00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I think as a whole that.</v>

85
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you another little side story </v>

86
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.330
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading about socrates today and I</v>

87
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>was reading about socrates trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.100
<v Speaker 1>he was tried by the Athenians for </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupting,</v>

89
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.670
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for failing to worship the gods and </v>

90
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.550
<v Speaker 1>corrupting the youth of Athens by like </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching them stuff and asking them </v>

91
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.550
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.721
<v Speaker 1>which is great way to corrupt people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he knew the trial was coming and </v>

93
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Athens wasn't a very big place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta,</v>

94
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.160
<v Speaker 1>about 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

95
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:16.161
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew who the powerful guys </v>

96
00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:16.161
<v Speaker 1>were in everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including socrates,</v>

97
00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:20.661
<v Speaker 1>knew that the trial was a warning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do like get out of town,</v>

98
00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:25.791
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to put you on trial in </v>

99
00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:26.130
<v Speaker 1>six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the potential penalty is death.</v>

100
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.050
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's like.</v>

101
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.950
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So socrates had a chat with his </v>

102
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.381
<v Speaker 1>compatriots and they were contemplating </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair means and foul to set up a defense </v>

103
00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:42.351
<v Speaker 1>for him so that he could or to leave so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he could not be tried and put to </v>

104
00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:42.351
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

105
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.630
<v Speaker 1>And he decided that he wasn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that and he also decided that he </v>

106
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:51.180
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going to even think about his </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense.</v>

107
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.190
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

108
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.800
<v Speaker 1>This is quite an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

109
00:05:55.801 --> 00:06:00.801
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told one of his friends that he had </v>

110
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>this voice in his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damon the spirit,</v>

111
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he always listened to in that.</v>

112
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:13.961
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the reasons he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from other people because he </v>

113
00:06:13.961 --> 00:06:13.961
<v Speaker 1>always listened to this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't tell him what to do,</v>

114
00:06:13.961 --> 00:06:18.221
<v Speaker 1>but it told him what not to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always told them what not to do and </v>

115
00:06:18.221 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>if it told them not to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he didn't do it.</v>

116
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 1>If he was speaking and the little voice </v>
<v Speaker 1>came up and said no.</v>

117
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Then he shut up and he tried to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else and he was very emphatic </v>

118
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.831
<v Speaker 1>about this and he said that when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to plan to evade the trial or even</v>

119
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 1>to mount his own defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the voice came up and said,</v>

120
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

121
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.920
<v Speaker 1>don't bother with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he thought,</v>

122
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

123
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>What the hell do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a trial coming and I'm </v>

124
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.711
<v Speaker 1>going to be put to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while he eventually concluded that </v>

125
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:55.530
<v Speaker 1>he was an old guy in the next 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in his seventies,</v>

126
00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:58.470
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the next 10 years weren't going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be that great forum.</v>

127
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.650
<v Speaker 1>He got a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the gods were giving them a chance</v>

128
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:02.960
<v Speaker 1>just to bow out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

129
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.110
<v Speaker 1>to put his inferiors in order to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>goodbye to everyone to avoid that last </v>

130
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.320
<v Speaker 1>descent into catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might've been particularly painful</v>

131
00:07:10.321 --> 00:07:15.321
<v Speaker 1>for a philosopher and to and to walk off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world on his own terms,</v>

132
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point I'm making with that is </v>

133
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.160
<v Speaker 1>socrates attended to this internal voice</v>
<v Speaker 1>that at least told them what not to do </v>

134
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.830
<v Speaker 1>and then he didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course socrates was a very </v>

135
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.321
<v Speaker 1>remarkable man and we still hear about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them today and we know that he existed </v>

136
00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:37.561
<v Speaker 1>and all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so back to the back to the walking </v>

137
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 1>with God idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

138
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.060
<v Speaker 1>as you elevate your aim,</v>

139
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.870
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

140
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.450
<v Speaker 1>create a judge at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

141
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Because the new ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an ideal you,</v>

142
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 1>even if it's just an ideal position that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might occupy,</v>

143
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 1>even if it's still conceptualized in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that concrete way,</v>

144
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a judge because it's above </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

145
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're,</v>

146
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.380
<v Speaker 1>you're terrified of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why you might be afraid </v>

147
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:07.380
<v Speaker 1>when you go start a new job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

148
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Because this thing is above you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're terrified of it and,</v>

149
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:10.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>judges you.</v>

150
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's useful because the judge that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're creating by formulating the ideal</v>

151
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.550
<v Speaker 1>tells you what's useless about yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can dispense with it and </v>

152
00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:27.041
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then every time you make a judge </v>

153
00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:29.591
<v Speaker 1>that's more elevated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's more useless you that has </v>

154
00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:32.141
<v Speaker 1>to be dispensed with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you create an ultimate </v>

155
00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 1>judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what the archetypal imagination</v>

156
00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:36.800
<v Speaker 1>of humankind has done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say with the figure of Christ,</v>

157
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:41.801
<v Speaker 1>because if Christ is nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is at least the archetypical perfect </v>

158
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:41.801
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

159
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>And therefore the judge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a judge that says,</v>

160
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 1>get rid of everything about yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't perfect.</v>

161
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also what Abraham.</v>

162
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.750
<v Speaker 1>That's also what God tells Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

163
00:08:50.751 --> 00:08:55.751
<v Speaker 1>He says to be perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pick on ideal that's high enough and </v>

164
00:08:55.751 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>you can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that's interesting about this,</v>

165
00:08:57.421 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I think as you can do it more or less on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own terms,</v>

166
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.760
<v Speaker 1>you have to have some collaboration from</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

167
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to pick an external </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal.</v>

168
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 1>You can pick an ideal that fulfills the </v>
<v Speaker 1>role of ideal for you.</v>

169
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

170
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>well if things could be set up for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I need them to be and if I could</v>

171
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Speaker 1>be who I needed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would that look like?</v>

172
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 1>And you can figure that out for yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then instantly you have a judge.</v>

173
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.410
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason people don't do it right?</v>

174
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Why don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't people look up and move ahead </v>

175
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:28.520
<v Speaker 1>and answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

176
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start formulating an ideal.</v>

177
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:34.941
<v Speaker 1>You formulate a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty easy to feel intimidated in </v>

178
00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>the face of your own ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to cane versus able,</v>

179
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:41.751
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's really easy to destroy the </v>

180
00:09:41.751 --> 00:09:42.780
<v Speaker 1>ideal instead of to try to pursue it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you get rid of the judge,</v>

181
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:48.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's way better lower the damn judge</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's too much like if your current </v>

182
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.910
<v Speaker 1>ambition is crushing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.920
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you're playing the tyrant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you should tap down your </v>

184
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.821
<v Speaker 1>ambitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not get rid of them by any stretch of </v>

185
00:09:58.821 --> 00:10:00.921
<v Speaker 1>the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least put the more reasonably </v>

186
00:10:00.921 --> 00:10:01.800
<v Speaker 1>within your grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to leap from point one to</v>

187
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:03.660
<v Speaker 1>point 50 in one leap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

188
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Speaker 1>You can do it incrementally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really liked this idea.</v>

189
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:11.901
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a profound idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of recapitulating yourself </v>

190
00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:16.980
<v Speaker 1>continually is also the process of it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a phoenix like process,</v>

191
00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:21.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're shedding all those elements of </v>

192
00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:24.441
<v Speaker 1>you that are no longer worthy of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuits that your that you're valuing,</v>

193
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.060
<v Speaker 1>and then I would say the idea here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as you do that,</v>

194
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:35.150
<v Speaker 1>you shape yourself ever more precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>into something that can withstand the </v>

195
00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:41.331
<v Speaker 1>tragedy of life and that can act as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a beacon to the world.</v>

196
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:42.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the right way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

197
00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:45.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe first to your friends and then to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family.</v>

198
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a hell of a finance </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision and there's no reason that it </v>

199
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:50.900
<v Speaker 1>can't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

200
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.521
<v Speaker 1>every one of you knows people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really bloody useful in a crisis and </v>

201
00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:55.650
<v Speaker 1>people that you admire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

202
00:10:55.651 --> 00:10:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Those are all you can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those people,</v>

203
00:10:57.811 --> 00:11:02.811
<v Speaker 1>as you admire that you admire us partial</v>
<v Speaker 1>incarnations of the archetypal Messiah.</v>

204
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:09.020
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the more that that manifests itself </v>

205
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.131
<v Speaker 1>at any given person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the more generally useful and </v>

206
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:16.401
<v Speaker 1>admirable that person is in a multitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>of situations and we don't know the </v>

207
00:11:16.401 --> 00:11:20.601
<v Speaker 1>limit to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people can be unbelievably good for </v>

208
00:11:20.601 --> 00:11:20.601
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

209
00:11:20.601 --> 00:11:21.660
<v Speaker 1>It's really something to behold.</v>
