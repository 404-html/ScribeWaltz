1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.080
<v Speaker 1>It's really fun to look at these old </v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures once you kind of know what they</v>

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>the delayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least that's what I've discovered is </v>

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>that once I kind of understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying rationale for.</v>

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean someone worked hard on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an engraving,</v>

6
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:19.491
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took a long time making that </v>

7
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>picture there are serious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you understand what it means,</v>

8
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those people there,</v>

9
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.370
<v Speaker 1>their prostate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prostrate at the,</v>

10
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

11
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.300
<v Speaker 1>at the revelation of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

12
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:34.301
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no wonder it's like breaks the law and </v>

13
00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.251
<v Speaker 1>see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Break the universal moral law man and </v>

14
00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:36.251
<v Speaker 1>see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

15
00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>I see people in that situation will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you all do all the time,</v>

16
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>perhaps me more than you because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist,</v>

17
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:46.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if the people I'm seeing having </v>

18
00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:48.800
<v Speaker 1>broken the universal law than you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody well be sure that people around </v>

19
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>them have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke,</v>

20
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.510
<v Speaker 1>like you make a mistake and things will </v>
<v Speaker 1>go seriously wrong for you.</v>

21
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>And so it's no wonder that you'd be</v>

22
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 1>terrified at the revelation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that governs our big.</v>

23
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's so remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the old testament,</v>

24
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>this is another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature commented door.</v>

25
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.760
<v Speaker 1>He was a real admirer of the Old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>

26
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.910
<v Speaker 1>not so much of the New Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was a sin for Europe to </v>

27
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>have glued the new testament onto the </v>
<v Speaker 1>old testament because he thought the old</v>

28
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:20.351
<v Speaker 1>testament was a really accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the phenomenology of </v>

29
00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Ba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like stay awake,</v>

30
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.820
<v Speaker 1>speak property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be honest or watch the hell out because </v>

31
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.410
<v Speaker 1>things will come your way that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>do not want to see at all.</v>

32
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>And it might not just be you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be everyone you know and </v>

33
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>everything about your culture that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>demolished for,</v>

34
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.090
<v Speaker 1>for generation after generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like stay awake and be careful.</v>

35
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.210
<v Speaker 1>And I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people only don't believe </v>

36
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.120
<v Speaker 1>that when they're being hubris stick.</v>

37
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And I think that most people know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep in their hearts,</v>

38
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:51.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get high on your horse,</v>

39
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.170
<v Speaker 1>that happens fairly often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have any sense,</v>

40
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:54.680
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>

41
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:59.681
<v Speaker 1>I better be careful and tap myself down </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fair bit because if I get too puffed </v>

42
00:01:59.681 --> 00:01:59.681
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

43
00:01:59.681 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>something's going to come along and take</v>
<v Speaker 1>me out at the knees and everyone knows </v>

44
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 1>that pride comes before a fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you have any.</v>

45
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:11.081
<v Speaker 1>That's why it says in the Old Testament </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fear of God is the beginning of </v>

46
00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:13.931
<v Speaker 1>wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I've never in all my years as </v>

47
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:15.380
<v Speaker 1>a clinical psychologist and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that really does terrify me.</v>

48
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.590
<v Speaker 1>I as I have never seen anyone ever get </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with anything at all.</v>

49
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Even once you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that old idea that God has a </v>

50
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.660
<v Speaker 1>and it keeps track of everything in </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven.</v>

52
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

53
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:28.310
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

55
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.580
<v Speaker 1>but that is a really useful thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about because while I'd maybe you </v>

56
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.751
<v Speaker 1>disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you think people get away with </v>

57
00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:40.751
<v Speaker 1>things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>

58
00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:43.901
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I see instead is that thing </v>

59
00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:43.901
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:46.070
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone twists the fabric of reality and</v>

61
00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:51.071
<v Speaker 1>they do it successfully because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't snap back at them that moment </v>

62
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:53.780
<v Speaker 1>and then like two years later something </v>
<v Speaker 1>unraveled and they get walloped and they</v>

63
00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:54.500
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

64
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:56.720
<v Speaker 1>that's so unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we track it.</v>

65
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

66
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>what happened before that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This?</v>

67
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Well then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

68
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>and then what this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what?</v>

69
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

70
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.440
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

71
00:03:06.441 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>that's where it went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

72
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:13.321
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't twist the fabric of </v>

73
00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>reality without having it snapped back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work that way.</v>

74
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>And why would it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what are you going to do?</v>

75
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Twists the fabric of reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

76
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it's bigger than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>and I think that one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really tempts people is the idea that,</v>

78
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get away with it.</v>

79
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

80
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>you try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see how well that works.</v>

81
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.540
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

82
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.570
<v Speaker 1>you get away with nothing and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of wisdom and it's </v>

83
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.740
<v Speaker 1>something that deeply terrifies me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

84
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.870
<v Speaker 1>ever since last September when I came to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a broader public attention,</v>

85
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:46.951
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I'd be terrified of </v>
<v Speaker 1>making a mistake because I certainly </v>

86
00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>know I'm more than capable of making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake and thank God so far,</v>

87
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>either I haven't made one or no one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>found out about it.</v>

88
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

89
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we walk on a very thin and narrow edge </v>

90
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.520
<v Speaker 1>and we're very lucky when things aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerating into chaos around this or </v>

91
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.540
<v Speaker 1>rapidly moving too far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much order and it's not an easy </v>

92
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.980
<v Speaker 1>thing to stay on that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell when you stay,</v>

93
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you're on that line because the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are deeply meaningful and engaging when </v>

94
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.741
<v Speaker 1>you're on that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're not existentially </v>

95
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 1>terrified about the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wavering off that,</v>

96
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 1>then you are truly not awake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

97
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I see in this picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:27.931
<v Speaker 1>it's like look out man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are rules and if you break</v>

99
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God help you.</v>

100
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
