1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.710
<v Speaker 1>So when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch yourself,</v>

2
00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:07.711
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I had a particularly good day at </v>

3
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:07.711
<v Speaker 1>work and what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.810
<v Speaker 1>it means that you lost your sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're having not a good </v>

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.840
<v Speaker 1>day at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like first it's one minute to three</v>

7
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:17.470
<v Speaker 1>and then it's</v>

8
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.300
<v Speaker 1>45 seconds to three and then it's 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

9
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what school was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

10
00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:28.981
<v Speaker 1>it was like click.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>

11
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:30.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>

12
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.170
<v Speaker 1>I went to my daughter's school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to get in trouble for talking all</v>

13
00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise surprise when I was a kid and I</v>

14
00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:44.851
<v Speaker 1>was bored stiff in school and so I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>misbehave upon occasion out of pure </v>

15
00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:51.151
<v Speaker 1>boredom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And about 21 years ago I went to my </v>

16
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.690
<v Speaker 1>daughter's school to sit for a class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about an hour long and I was </v>

17
00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:05.191
<v Speaker 1>sitting there and the teacher had all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids on the floor and was having </v>

18
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>some of the kids read to the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of the kids who were reading </v>

19
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.751
<v Speaker 1>couldn't read at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had exactly the same experience I </v>

20
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.340
<v Speaker 1>was sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like being like being seven years</v>

21
00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:16.810
<v Speaker 1>old again and I could see the clock </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

22
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>

23
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>if I was in this classroom for three </v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

25
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I would misbehave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit 40 years old,</v>

26
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I would misbehave exactly like I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was when I was six.</v>

27
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:35.990
<v Speaker 1>that's no place to be right because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

29
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be in a place that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>stultifying.</v>

30
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be in a place where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no challenge.</v>

31
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>You might even quit your job if there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no challenge.</v>

32
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a good job.</v>

33
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>It gives you security and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

34
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I can't stand this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's eating away at my soul.</v>

35
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.270
<v Speaker 1>It's all security and no challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do you want to challenge?</v>

36
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what you're built for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're built for your built </v>

37
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>to take on a maximal load,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38
00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:03.381
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what strengthens you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to be strong because life is </v>

39
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily difficult and because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the evil king is always widdling away at</v>

40
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:10.911
<v Speaker 1>the structure of the state and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be awake and sharp to stop that from </v>

41
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:14.481
<v Speaker 1>happening so that you don't become </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and so that your family doesn't </v>

42
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>become corrupt and so that your state </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to be come become corrupt.</v>

43
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.520
<v Speaker 1>You have to have your eyes open and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sharp and your words at the ready </v>

44
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>and you have to be educated and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know about your history and you know </v>

45
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>how have to know how to think and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to know how to read and you have to</v>

46
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>know how to speak and you have to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to aim and you have to be willing to</v>

47
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>hoist the troubles of the world up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your shoulders.</v>

48
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>And what's so interesting about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So remarkable.</v>

49
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.470
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested itself to me as I've been </v>

50
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.221
<v Speaker 1>doing these public lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking about responsibility </v>

51
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:49.071
<v Speaker 1>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't seem to happen very often </v>

52
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the audiences are dead quiet.</v>

53
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>And I lay out this idea that life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy tainted by malevolence,</v>

54
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>and everyone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

55
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>well we already always suspected that no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one has ever said it quite so bluntly,</v>

56
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.140
<v Speaker 1>and it's quite a relief to hear that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the only person who has those </v>

57
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.140
<v Speaker 1>suspicions.</v>

58
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>And then the second part of that is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>better part,</v>

59
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:11.911
<v Speaker 1>and it's the optimistic part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is despite the fact that life is a</v>

60
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>tragedy tainted by malevolence at every </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of existence,</v>

61
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.600
<v Speaker 1>there's something about the human spirit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can thrive under precisely those </v>

62
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.281
<v Speaker 1>conditions if we allow that to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as difficult as life is and as </v>

63
00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:31.171
<v Speaker 1>horrible as we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our capacity to deal with that </v>

64
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:35.640
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe and to transcend that </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent spirit is more powerful than </v>

65
00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>the that reality itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the fundamental issue.</v>

66
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the fundamental issue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Judaeo Christian ethic with its </v>

67
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on the divinity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

68
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>As catastrophic as life is and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent as people can be.</v>

69
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's malevolent beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally the person has in spirit </v>

70
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:05.251
<v Speaker 1>the nobility to set that right and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>defeat evil and that and that.</v>

71
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.730
<v Speaker 1>More than that and that the antidote to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the catastrophe of life and the </v>

72
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>suffering of life and the tragedy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life that can drive you down and destroy</v>

73
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:19.471
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to take on exactly that </v>

74
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:19.471
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

75
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:24.330
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of work to be done and </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that terrible and there isn't </v>

76
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.441
<v Speaker 1>anything so bad that we can't make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse and certainly try very hard to do </v>

77
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:33.631
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have it within me to decide that </v>

78
00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stand up against that.</v>

79
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to strive to make the world a </v>
<v Speaker 1>better place.</v>

80
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to strive to constrain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence that's in my own heart and </v>

81
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.061
<v Speaker 1>to set my family's straight and to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work despite my tragic lot,</v>

82
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>for the betterment of anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything that's in front of me.</v>

83
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.210
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immediate consequences of that is </v>

84
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.790
<v Speaker 1>that when you make the decision to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>on all of that voluntarily,</v>

85
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 1>which is to stand up straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

86
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 1>with your shoulders back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take on that,</v>

87
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 1>all that on voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you make that decision,</v>

88
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>then all the catastrophe justifies </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

89
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.950
<v Speaker 1>In the nobility of your striving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what it means to be an </v>

90
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:16.580
<v Speaker 1>individual thing.</v>

91
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
