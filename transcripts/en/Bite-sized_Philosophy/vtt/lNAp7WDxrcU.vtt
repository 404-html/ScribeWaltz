1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always curious about the,</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.360
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the practical implications of scientific</v>

3
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>research both at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a personal level,</v>

4
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>familial level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social level,</v>

5
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:11.370
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

6
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:16.371
<v Speaker 1>So I mean one of the things that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>planning to do in the near future is to </v>

7
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:20.061
<v Speaker 1>launch a website that will enable people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to assess themselves with what we've </v>

8
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:24.191
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A scale called the big five aspects </v>

9
00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 1>scale that breaks the big five down into</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 aspects,</v>

10
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:29.601
<v Speaker 1>each of which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which provide some additional high </v>

11
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>resolution and useful descriptions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

12
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>So you build to go there and find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what your personality is like.</v>

13
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>You'd be able to compare yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people who,</v>

14
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:41.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find out where your similarities and </v>

15
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:44.091
<v Speaker 1>differences are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things we've been </v>

16
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:46.191
<v Speaker 1>thinking about doing as well is putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on the same side or real Iq test.</v>

17
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Nicely validated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably focusing on fluid intelligence </v>

18
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 1>because it's a little bit less </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistically complex to do so.</v>

19
00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:59.811
<v Speaker 1>But maybe measuring verbal intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then showing people the strata of </v>

20
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>occupations in which they're likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find maximal success.</v>

21
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

22
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that I know that,</v>

23
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 1>that people vary in their cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>abilities tremendously and that that's </v>

24
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>actually an important determinant of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their life outcome,</v>

25
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say someone tests out in an icu</v>

26
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>of around a hundred and 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you can say,</v>

27
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.190
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty damn smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

29
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.990
<v Speaker 1>you're up above 85 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general population.</v>

30
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could probably do a pretty damn good</v>

31
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>job as an undergraduate in university if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're also disciplined,</v>

32
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were conscientious,</v>

33
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:34.740
<v Speaker 1>he hit the books hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna,</v>

34
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna come out in the top core </v>
<v Speaker 1>tile of your class,</v>

35
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>assuming that you're not at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly successful,</v>

36
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>a spectacularly selective university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have a much more </v>

37
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>difficult time as a master's student and</v>
<v Speaker 1>phd level stuff is going to be.</v>

38
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be pushing your luck to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really master that.</v>

39
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be,</v>

40
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a domain of,</v>

41
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

42
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Industrial organizational activity where</v>

44
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>you could really be in the top 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile.</v>

45
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

46
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.150
<v Speaker 1>so if you have an Iq of 115,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you might make one bang up plumber </v>

47
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>and you could have a spectacularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful career as a plumber and maybe</v>

48
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>as a manager of other plumbers and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that and you know,</v>

49
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.870
<v Speaker 1>and I actually happened to be a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasis,</v>

50
00:02:19.871 --> 00:02:24.871
<v Speaker 1>he announced at one of the trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I certainly don't think of that as </v>

51
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:27.381
<v Speaker 1>something that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a low quality or low status </v>

52
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>occupation in the least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we would,</v>

53
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>we would like to tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

54
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>heres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heres,</v>

55
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.540
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an intellectual domain that's </v>

56
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.361
<v Speaker 1>probably too high for you to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful without working insane hours </v>

57
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:44.690
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

58
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.350
<v Speaker 1>to close the gap because you can do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>within St.</v>

59
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>work up to some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some limited degree.</v>

60
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.890
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to me that the logical </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do at least in part is to give </v>

61
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.611
<v Speaker 1>people a sense of what their advantages </v>
<v Speaker 1>and limitations are and then say to </v>

62
00:02:58.611 --> 00:02:58.611
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

63
00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:03.441
<v Speaker 1>well given that here's a place that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could go where you could be optimally </v>

64
00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

65
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda my take from a policy </v>

66
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.340
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

67
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>but like what have you thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.670
<v Speaker 1>the massive diversity and intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>

69
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.690
<v Speaker 1>you mean what are the implications from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a policy perspective as far as you're </v>

70
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.690
<v Speaker 1>concerned?</v>

71
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think vocational guidance is clearly </v>

72
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.211
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually did some consulting and some </v>

73
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:27.350
<v Speaker 2>research for a nonprofit group called </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Johnson O'connor Foundation,</v>

74
00:03:27.351 --> 00:03:31.920
<v Speaker 2>which is a vocational testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not that big on ge,</v>

75
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.370
<v Speaker 2>but they have their own battery of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tests.</v>

76
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 2>They bring someone in and do a full day </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

77
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:43.681
<v Speaker 2>of cognitive tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from that they give some advice </v>

78
00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:48.071
<v Speaker 2>about what kinds of professions match </v>
<v Speaker 2>their cognitive strengths and </v>

79
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:53.051
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually did some brain imaging a </v>

80
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:55.100
<v Speaker 2>on their tests and it was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting stuff.</v>

81
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Did you think they do because it's hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do the psychometrics properly with </v>

82
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>regards to vocational guidance because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know.</v>

83
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.950
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a good handle on how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>classify jobs into their various </v>

84
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.881
<v Speaker 1>subtypes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like John Holland has done some good </v>

85
00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:14.881
<v Speaker 1>work doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

86
00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>but there's so many jobs and it's hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out.</v>

87
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes two jobs the same or similar,</v>

88
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

89
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at Hopkins when Hollen was there </v>

90
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.931
<v Speaker 2>in some of my friends were graduate </v>
<v Speaker 2>students work for him and I learned all </v>

91
00:04:26.931 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 2>about that vocational testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very powerful.</v>

92
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:30.830
<v Speaker 2>And as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

93
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
<v Speaker 2>that's more of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his scales have kind of morphed into </v>

94
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 2>more personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White dementia.</v>

95
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's it.</v>

96
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the nexus that we want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>play out.</v>

97
00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:44.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is a reason.</v>

98
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 1>I know people have been mapping Holland </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holland job categories onto the big five</v>

99
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:51.050
<v Speaker 1>and we have a fair bit of success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>and we're hoping that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiation down to the 10 levels of</v>

101
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>personality will provide even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>precision.</v>

102
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with more general policy let.</v>

103
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>

104
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 1>So reasonable vocational counseling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good idea.</v>

105
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 1>When does it start?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just starting junior high,</v>

106
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.250
<v Speaker 1>like do you do what the Europeans do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to track people into trades and,</v>

107
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and higher education at that kind of </v>

108
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 1>early age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your</v>

109
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.460
<v Speaker 2>opinion seemed to have had great success</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

110
00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 2>So it's certainly Germans in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

111
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.850
<v Speaker 2>So reasonable to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem in the United States,</v>

112
00:05:25.851 --> 00:05:30.851
<v Speaker 2>there were so many problems with the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>we conceptualize education and the whole</v>

113
00:05:34.071 --> 00:05:37.220
<v Speaker 2>idea of tracking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it is in Canada,</v>

114
00:05:37.221 --> 00:05:42.221
<v Speaker 2>but in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea of tracking it has a very </v>

115
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:42.350
<v Speaker 2>negative balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it,</v>

116
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>segregating the smart kids into one,</v>

117
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.710
<v Speaker 2>one a set of classes and the less smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids into others.</v>

118
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.970
<v Speaker 2>And then there's remedial education and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been a tendency,</v>

119
00:05:55.971 --> 00:06:00.971
<v Speaker 2>a strong tendency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States to feel that kids are </v>

120
00:06:00.971 --> 00:06:05.151
<v Speaker 2>learning from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't want homogeneous groups </v>

121
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 2>based on learning ability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your want.</v>

122
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.600
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny because people say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to two,</v>

123
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.960
<v Speaker 1>let's say academic achievement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they play exactly the opposite.</v>

124
00:06:15.961 --> 00:06:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Stumped when it comes to such things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>has childhood sports.</v>

125
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.290
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at football for example,</v>

126
00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:23.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well hey,</v>

127
00:06:23.221 --> 00:06:28.221
<v Speaker 1>let's segregate like ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't have the people who </v>

128
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:28.710
<v Speaker 1>stumble around on the field dropping the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball all the time,</v>

129
00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:32.160
<v Speaker 1>playing with the top end quarterbacks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody thinks there's a problem with</v>

130
00:06:32.161 --> 00:06:37.161
<v Speaker 1>that is they don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well everyone learns from everyone else </v>

131
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:40.221
<v Speaker 1>in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me it speaks more of a refusal to </v>

132
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 1>admit to the stark reality that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are massive cognitive differences </v>

133
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.071
<v Speaker 1>between people and to try to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to address that with some degree </v>

134
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:50.670
<v Speaker 1>of seriousness and the serious should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

135
00:06:50.671 --> 00:06:52.800
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's look at the bottom 15 percent</v>

136
00:06:52.801 --> 00:06:55.140
<v Speaker 1>of the population cognitively speaking.</v>

137
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the hell can we do for </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people that's going to be useful?</v>

138
00:06:59.761 --> 00:07:04.761
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the guy that I was telling you </v>

139
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:06.831
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to think of some way that </v>

140
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:09.141
<v Speaker 1>he could find a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a respectable and productive and </v>

141
00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:13.410
<v Speaker 1>relatively stable position in society </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be useful.</v>

142
00:07:13.411 --> 00:07:15.300
<v Speaker 1>And I thought there was a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things he could do.</v>

143
00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things he could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>

144
00:07:17.161 --> 00:07:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I think he could have been encouraged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

145
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.850
<v Speaker 1>to to collect trash in the downtown </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas like he could have been assigned a</v>

146
00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:29.460
<v Speaker 1>city block and it could have been said </v>
<v Speaker 1>to him,</v>

147
00:07:29.461 --> 00:07:32.580
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job is to keep this damn city block</v>

148
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.190
<v Speaker 1>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a bag,</v>

149
00:07:35.191 --> 00:07:36.780
<v Speaker 1>here's the stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get up in the morning,</v>

150
00:07:36.781 --> 00:07:39.450
<v Speaker 1>you go do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it makes everybody's life more</v>

151
00:07:39.451 --> 00:07:41.910
<v Speaker 1>pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a valuable contribution.</v>

152
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:47.090
<v Speaker 1>It's something you could do with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain degree of pride and it and </v>

153
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a socially valuable end of it.</v>

154
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens in Toronto is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people drive around these vacuum cleaner</v>

155
00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:56.691
<v Speaker 1>machines on sidewalks and pick up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrap paper and all of that actually </v>

156
00:07:57.541 --> 00:08:00.390
<v Speaker 1>turns out to be a very cognitively </v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding job because,</v>

157
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay careful attention.</v>

158
00:08:02.611 --> 00:08:07.611
<v Speaker 1>You can't run over people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have decent social skills </v>

159
00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:08.970
<v Speaker 1>and you know it's complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be nice to see,</v>

160
00:08:08.971 --> 00:08:12.090
<v Speaker 1>but we were not mature enough to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion like this.</v>

161
00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:14.430
<v Speaker 1>As a society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might want to say is like,</v>

162
00:08:14.431 --> 00:08:19.431
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's a group of people who </v>

163
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:19.431
<v Speaker 1>aren't going to be able to compete in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

164
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 1>in the cognitive workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to do it and there's </v>

165
00:08:24.751 --> 00:08:29.751
<v Speaker 1>actually lots of them and we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to say they're lazy and we're not </v>

166
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:29.751
<v Speaker 1>going to say they're not looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

167
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:30.750
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to say any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to say,</v>

168
00:08:30.751 --> 00:08:35.751
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to find occupations that have </v>

169
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:41.160
<v Speaker 1>public utility that aren't just make </v>
<v Speaker 1>work projects that people have.</v>

170
00:08:41.161 --> 00:08:46.161
<v Speaker 1>That level of abstract capacity could </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually perform,</v>

171
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.410
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we have the maturity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have that conversation.</v>

172
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
<v Speaker 2>We don't have the economics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would go even a little to the </v>

173
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 2>left of you and I would say there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with work programs,</v>

174
00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

175
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:04.670
<v Speaker 2>to allow people to work with dignity so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have that option.</v>

176
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 2>But you also had this interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment being proposed on the minimum</v>

177
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 2>annual income.</v>

178
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one worries me because see if </v>

179
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it concerns me because,</v>

180
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're having a conversation here </v>

181
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.430
<v Speaker 1>where we're taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

182
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 1>differences in Iq seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with the guaranteed </v>

183
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.620
<v Speaker 1>annual income issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the problems,</v>

184
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.560
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not denying its potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility,</v>

185
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.740
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I think that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be experimentally determined,</v>

186
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>

187
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:42.170
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it could replace a plethora of</v>
<v Speaker 1>less efficient social welfare programs.</v>

188
00:09:42.311 --> 00:09:43.570
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

189
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.720
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious to me that there's a </v>

190
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.700
<v Speaker 1>substantial proportion of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

191
00:09:51.701 --> 00:09:56.701
<v Speaker 1>And I would say it's probably five </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent that would destroy themselves </v>

192
00:09:56.701 --> 00:10:00.740
<v Speaker 1>instantly if you gave them a guaranteed </v>
<v Speaker 1>annual income and they would do it </v>

193
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.980
<v Speaker 1>because they're very low in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

194
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And very impulsive.</v>

195
00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:07.650
<v Speaker 1>And I've worked with many guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite often x,</v>

196
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:12.651
<v Speaker 1>cocaine addicts who were often not all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that high on the end of the cognitive </v>

197
00:10:12.651 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very,</v>

198
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 1>very low in conscientiousness in </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsivity.</v>

199
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.200
<v Speaker 1>And those guys were absolutely fine as </v>
<v Speaker 1>long as they were flat broke.</v>

200
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.320
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you as soon as they had money,</v>

201
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.530
<v Speaker 1>they were done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like three days in the bar,</v>

202
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.700
<v Speaker 1>cocaine binge face down in a ditch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they were fine until they got money</v>

203
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't.</v>

204
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.970
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the Guarente Dan annual</v>
<v Speaker 1>income solution is that man does not </v>

205
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:41.300
<v Speaker 1>live by bread alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say in the.</v>

206
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 1>If you have money and you have things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

207
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 1>then you have a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you just have money,</v>

208
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.900
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a life.</v>
