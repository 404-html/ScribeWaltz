1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.270
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio doesn't know any better and </v>

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.761
<v Speaker 1>he's got the egotism of youth and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>offered the easy way to success,</v>

3
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what the Fox tells them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and off they go to see Stromboli.</v>

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>So this is the song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to read it all.</v>

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>It's great to be a celebrity and actor's</v>
<v Speaker 1>life for me.</v>

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sleep till after to you promenade a </v>

7
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>big cigar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tour the world in a private car,</v>

8
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>you dine on chicken and caviar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actor's life for me.</v>

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's all this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wealth and public exposure and zero </v>

10
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.320
<v Speaker 1>attention whatsoever to anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>regarding responsibility or discipline </v>

11
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>or learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a dual attraction,</v>

12
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get everything we want and you don't</v>

13
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>have to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

14
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:52.611
<v Speaker 1>What a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what the act or </v>

15
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:52.611
<v Speaker 1>represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

16
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

17
00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>it's someone who's acting out a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deception there,</v>

18
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.870
<v Speaker 1>a persona in the union sense.</v>

19
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>So the persona is the mask you wear in </v>
<v Speaker 1>public that you might even think you </v>

20
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not.</v>

21
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>It's this mask and that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the persona.</v>

22
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:13.401
<v Speaker 1>So the Fox and the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or inviting the puppet to only become a </v>

23
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>persona and and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's see for you,</v>

24
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.640
<v Speaker 1>you start as a persona and then when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to investigate the parts of you </v>

25
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>that don't really fit in that persona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the shadow.</v>

26
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Then you start understanding who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really are and that's shocking because </v>

27
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 1>the persona contains everything roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking that you think is good.</v>

28
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:39.711
<v Speaker 1>It may be even that your immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture thinks is good and then the </v>

29
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:42.951
<v Speaker 1>shadow contains everything that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that and some of that's really </v>

30
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of it is good,</v>

31
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.150
<v Speaker 1>disguised as bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't break out of the persona </v>

32
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 1>and transcended until you incorporate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of what's in the shadow.</v>

33
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.650
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're an extraordinarily </v>

34
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.841
<v Speaker 1>compassionate person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say 98th percentile will say </v>

35
00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be sacrificing yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>to other people all the time and there </v>

36
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>are people who will find that </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily endearing and it will be</v>

37
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:12.711
<v Speaker 1>under some circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is that you will </v>

38
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice yourself and that's a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad attitude to have.</v>

39
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards adult males.</v>

40
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a great thing for infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for adult males is the wrong </v>

41
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.171
<v Speaker 1>approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you will get taken advantage of </v>

42
00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>continually by people who are looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone like you until you grow some</v>

43
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:29.290
<v Speaker 1>teeth and you'll think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

44
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the opposite of compassion.</v>

45
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Being able to bite hard is the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 1>of compassion,</v>

46
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.220
<v Speaker 1>which it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you'll have that pushed into the </v>

47
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>predatory category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>

48
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like conflict.</v>

49
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like until you bring that out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the depths and put it on so you can use </v>

50
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be in trouble and that's</v>

51
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:55.131
<v Speaker 1>kind of niches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of the reevaluation of good and </v>

52
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:55.131
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

53
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:58.911
<v Speaker 1>You have a sense of what's good in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of what isn't with your </v>

54
00:02:58.911 --> 00:02:58.911
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not very smart.</v>

55
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.080
<v Speaker 1>It's got things in the wrong boxes and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the things that even nature </v>

56
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.831
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the things that you accept as </v>

57
00:03:07.831 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>untrammeled goods like compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say have a very dark side,</v>

58
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:15.001
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and second are not enough to get you </v>

59
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:18.061
<v Speaker 1>through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need the opposite virtues to and so </v>

60
00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:21.481
<v Speaker 1>you have to develop them and so you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the persona to do that,</v>

61
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.120
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio was invited to be a false </v>

62
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.661
<v Speaker 1>persona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take the gains of celebrity without </v>

63
00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>having to do anything to be educated.</v>

64
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.030
<v Speaker 1>He's just gonna go right to the top from</v>
<v Speaker 1>right where he is and you know people </v>

65
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.931
<v Speaker 1>are kind of fascinated by that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you watch America's got </v>

66
00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>talent or the x factor which your shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually love.</v>

67
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.420
<v Speaker 1>By the way you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

68
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>You never see narcissism in its pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms.</v>

69
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Then you see it when you watch people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who display an absolute lack of talent </v>

70
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>and become homicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone dares pointed out,</v>

71
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accusatory and homicidal,</v>

72
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>instantly it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really something,</v>

73
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>and then now and then you do see one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people who's so introverted and so</v>

74
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>out of society and have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable gift,</v>

75
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:14.251
<v Speaker 1>which is also something really </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable to see and it's no wonder </v>

76
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:17.701
<v Speaker 1>those things are so popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're psychologically extraordinarily </v>

77
00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
