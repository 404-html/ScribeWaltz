00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.570
<v Speaker 1>People who are cynical about religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures like to think of faith as the</v>

2
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:11.331
<v Speaker 1>willingness to demolish your intellect </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the service of superstition and you </v>

3
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

4
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>there's something to be said for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>but not a lot because the reality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more sophisticated.</v>

6
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:25.581
<v Speaker 1>Part of the faith that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is being insisted upon in the old </v>

7
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:30.441
<v Speaker 1>testament is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm speaking psychologically here </v>

8
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:32.030
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's useful.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Deposit A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

10
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to aim at it.</v>

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

12
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:41.291
<v Speaker 1>I really think that's practically useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the research we've done with the </v>

13
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

14
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:46.311
<v Speaker 1>indicates pretty clearly that if you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to conceptualize an ideal and a </v>

15
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>unbalanced ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>so what do you want for your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for your career?</v>

17
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:55.131
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for your education?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for your character </v>

18
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:57.921
<v Speaker 1>development?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to use your time </v>

19
00:00:57.921 --> 00:00:57.921
<v Speaker 1>outside of work?</v>

20
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to structure your use </v>
<v Speaker 1>of drugs and alcohol and places where </v>

21
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.351
<v Speaker 1>you might get impulsive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you avoid falling into a </v>

22
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>horrible path?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really think that through and you</v>

23
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>come up with an integrated ideal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

24
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>you put it above us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to reach for,</v>

25
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.580
<v Speaker 1>then you're more committed to the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a positive way and you're less </v>

26
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>tormented by anxiety and uncertainty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and that makes sense,</v>

27
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:28.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because here you are alive and </v>

28
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so unless you were Cape,</v>

29
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>if you're not capable of manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>some positive relationship with the fact</v>

30
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:38.211
<v Speaker 1>of your being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then how could that be anything other </v>

31
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:41.181
<v Speaker 1>than hellish because it would just be </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety provoking and terrible because </v>

32
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>you're vulnerable and there'd be nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful or worthwhile to do.</v>

33
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not.</v>

34
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I just can't see that as a winning </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy for anyone.</v>

35
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>You can make a rational case for </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopting that strategy in that,</v>

36
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

37
00:01:55.051 --> 00:02:00.051
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence for for a </v>

38
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:00.051
<v Speaker 1>transcendent morality or for an ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

39
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:04.371
<v Speaker 1>There's no hard empirical evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that there's </v>

40
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>existential evidence as well that has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be taken into account and of course like</v>

41
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>psychologists have talked about this a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

42
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm Carl Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

43
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>in [inaudible] for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud for that matter,</v>

44
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 1>most of the great psychologists have </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out that you know,</v>

45
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>you can derive reasonable information </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's solid from your own experience,</v>

46
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:29.301
<v Speaker 1>especially if you also talk to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and you can kind of see in your </v>

47
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:32.631
<v Speaker 1>own life when you're on a productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>path that sort of ennobles and </v>

48
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:37.040
<v Speaker 1>enlightens you or a destructive path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's kind of useful to think</v>

49
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>that maybe the dichotomy between those </v>
<v Speaker 1>two paths might be real,</v>

50
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

51
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:48.451
<v Speaker 1>and because that also allows you to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>credence to your intuitions about that </v>

52
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>

53
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.120
<v Speaker 1>But I don't anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's unreasonable to pause</v>

54
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That since you're alive,</v>

55
00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.140
<v Speaker 1>adopting the highest possible regard for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you're alive and you're </v>

56
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by other creatures that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

57
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I just can't see how that can possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>be construed as a losing strategy.</v>

58
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's something like faith,</v>

59
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's faith,</v>

60
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not only faith in your being,</v>

61
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's faith in being as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the faith would be something like,</v>

62
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.600
<v Speaker 1>if you could orient your being properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe that would orient you with </v>

63
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>being as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you never know.</v>

64
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might be true.</v>

65
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to assume that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be true.</v>

66
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you just take a strict </v>

67
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.471
<v Speaker 1>biological perspective on this and think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about us as the product of three and a </v>

68
00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>half billion years of evolution.</v>

69
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have struggled over all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of years to be alive and to </v>

70
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:48.631
<v Speaker 1>match ourselves with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because one of the things I've </v>

71
00:03:48.631 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>often wondered is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>life is definitely difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>

73
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:57.181
<v Speaker 1>And it's unfair and there's inequality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of those things and people are </v>

74
00:03:57.181 --> 00:04:00.301
<v Speaker 1>subject to all sorts of terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also wonder if you weren't </v>

75
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:05.791
<v Speaker 1>actively striving to make things worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just how much better could they be?</v>

76
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people are very,</v>

77
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>they're like houses that are divided </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst themselves.</v>

78
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 1>They're pointing in six different </v>
<v Speaker 1>directions at the same time.</v>

79
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.590
<v Speaker 1>They're working at cross purposes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves because of bitterness and </v>

80
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.461
<v Speaker 1>resentment and an what unprocessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories and childhood hatreds and </v>

81
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>unexamined assumptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things,</v>

82
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:34.981
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just gotta wonder if you could push </v>

83
00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:38.431
<v Speaker 1>that aside and orient yourself properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that of course </v>

84
00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:42.451
<v Speaker 1>is stressed very heavily in the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>testament and of course that goes </v>

85
00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:46.681
<v Speaker 1>through the entire biblical corpus is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's not only enough to establish a</v>

86
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 1>positive relationship with being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is the essential.</v>

87
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a good description of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make that decision,</v>

88
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because being is very ambivalent and you</v>

89
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:03.031
<v Speaker 1>can make the case that maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that should have never </v>

90
00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:05.941
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't seem to be productive </v>

91
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:05.941
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And faith seems to be.</v>

92
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:10.591
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to act as if being is </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately justifiable and that if I </v>

93
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:15.421
<v Speaker 1>partake in it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will improve it rather than making it </v>

94
00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:18.721
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's the statement of </v>

95
00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:21.331
<v Speaker 1>faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what seems to go along with </v>

96
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 1>that is something like truth in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conception,</v>

97
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 1>inaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

98
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 1>even people like Jacob who are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn morally ambivalent to begin with,</v>

99
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.940
<v Speaker 1>get hammered a lot by what they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and what seems to happen is that</v>

100
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>they're hammered into some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical shape,</v>

101
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the mid point of their life's </v>

102
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people who are solidly planted</v>

103
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.370
<v Speaker 1>who you can trust and who don't betray </v>
<v Speaker 1>being or themselves or their fellow </v>

104
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>

105
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.460
<v Speaker 1>And so it's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems reasonable to me to </v>

106
00:05:55.541 --> 00:06:00.541
<v Speaker 1>first assume that you have establish a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with something that's </v>

107
00:06:00.541 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might even be just the future version</v>

108
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:07.421
<v Speaker 1>of you and then second that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>align yourself with reality in a </v>

109
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:13.181
<v Speaker 1>truthful manner and that that's your </v>
<v Speaker 1>best bet and the biblical stories at </v>

110
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:21.491
<v Speaker 1>Roxbury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite realistic about that too because </v>

111
00:06:21.491 --> 00:06:21.491
<v Speaker 1>they don't really say that if you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

112
00:06:21.491 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be instantly transported</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the promised land.</v>

113
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Like even Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we'll find out in the accident </v>

114
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.350
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never makes it to the promised land.</v>

115
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not like you're offered </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneous,</v>

116
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:38.741
<v Speaker 1>final redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you move out forthrightly into the </v>

117
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:42.101
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>establish a faithful relationship with </v>

118
00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:44.810
<v Speaker 1>being an attempt to conduct yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>with integrity,</v>

119
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's your best bet and it might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good enough,</v>

120
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.620

<v Speaker 1>alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be something closely akin</v>

<v Speaker 1>to hail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both personal and social.</v>
