1
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.840
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Jonah gets a call from God and God </v>

2
00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:14.591
<v Speaker 1>tells him that there's a city Nineveh </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's falling into moral disarray.</v>

3
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

4
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a universal story.</v>

5
00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:25.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like all cultures are always </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling into disarray.</v>

6
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.450
<v Speaker 1>It's their nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just entropy does that,</v>

7
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things change.</v>

8
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:36.431
<v Speaker 1>The world changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The environment changes and the culture </v>

9
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:39.221
<v Speaker 1>doesn't keep up very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course it has corrupt </v>

10
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:40.550
<v Speaker 1>elements and so it's an inherent eternal</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>The individual is always placed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to a culture that somewhat </v>

12
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the question is,</v>

13
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do about it?</v>

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.200
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer is nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then it'll just get more corrupt </v>

15
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.240
<v Speaker 1>and if the answer is be corrupt too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it will just get more corrupt.</v>

16
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 1>So the answer has to be to oppose the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption because that's the only way </v>

17
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>it's going to stop.</v>

18
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God threatens to destroy this city </v>

19
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.890
<v Speaker 1>because of its corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think you need to presume </v>

20
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 1>anything particularly metaphysical about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to understand it.</v>

21
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.510
<v Speaker 1>It's very straightforward that the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt the culture is and the less </v>

22
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 1>trust is possible between individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less productive of the culture is </v>

23
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.091
<v Speaker 1>going to be because why do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if some corrupt person is just going to </v>

24
00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>come and take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it,</v>

25
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>it might even be that the culture is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupted.</v>

26
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.480
<v Speaker 1>If you are good for something and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce resources,</v>

27
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 1>you're actually more likely to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed because you have something of </v>

28
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like there's just,</v>

29
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.380
<v Speaker 1>you're just not going anywhere with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

30
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>And why would you work if you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any sense that you know,</v>

31
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>you could store up the value of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>work for some reasonable time in the </v>

32
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.060
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the society is corrupt and there's</v>

33
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:04.520
<v Speaker 1>no trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's degenerating and you know,</v>

34
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:07.580
<v Speaker 1>it might live for awhile but isn't going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to last very long.</v>

35
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:10.190
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corrupt societies collapse.</v>

36
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.400
<v Speaker 1>That leaves open what corruption means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

37
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Jonah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

38
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bloody way.</v>

39
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to that city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can go to hell as far as I'm </v>

40
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.420
<v Speaker 1>concerned and that's really what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks.</v>

41
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>And why in the world should I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about it anyways?</v>

42
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Speaker 1>And these are good objections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

43
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.250
<v Speaker 1>why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll face this,</v>

44
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.760
<v Speaker 1>believe me in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will face this.</v>

45
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:40.280
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already do always constantly,</v>

46
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.490
<v Speaker 1>continually in small ways perhaps when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting with people who </v>

47
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.020
<v Speaker 1>aren't treating you properly and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're acting.</v>

48
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>And those might be your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be your friends,</v>

49
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:53.240
<v Speaker 1>they might be people at your workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be professors,</v>

50
00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.480
<v Speaker 1>they're playing a crooked game and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like it and you know it's crooked.</v>

51
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

52
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>what should you do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

53
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:06.080
<v Speaker 1>if you know your crib,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

54
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>it's crooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so good to play along with it.</v>

55
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll say that you know,</v>

56
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>it's crooked by your own standard of </v>
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>

57
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>It d degrades you to play along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to stand up and oppose it.</v>

58
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

59
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.710
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're probably going to do what Jonah </v>

60
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.041
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jump on a ship and get the hell out of </v>

61
00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:29.041
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

62
00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:33.690
<v Speaker 1>that's a logical thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't solve the problem and I </v>

63
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.561
<v Speaker 1>think this has something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>human ethical responsibility because </v>

64
00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:41.371
<v Speaker 1>there are other old stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you one likely where the </v>

65
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>son of the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion king,</v>

66
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.680
<v Speaker 1>the son of the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes off and he's some pathetic </v>

67
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.671
<v Speaker 1>adolescent and then he shamed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reappearance of his old girlfriend into </v>

68
00:03:56.671 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>turning into something vaguely useful.</v>

69
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.290
<v Speaker 1>And he opens his eyes and he goes back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he fights scar and no,</v>

70
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a scene of hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Because there's fire everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he fights.</v>

72
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Scar finds out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scar killed.</v>

73
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 1>His father casts him into the pit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

74
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>And then the rain comes and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

75
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:23.101
<v Speaker 1>the movie returns to its beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally paradise,</v>

76
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Paradise lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise regained.</v>

77
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>That's the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and I mean,</v>

78
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 1>that's the story of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 1>you're in a place that's working out </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty well.</v>

80
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Something happens to knock you off your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perch.</v>

81
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>You're down in the chaos for a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of time.</v>

82
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.430
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you never get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you learn something down </v>

83
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a strength in your character,</v>

84
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 1>then you pop up to a new place and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better,</v>

85
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 1>better aim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better you.</v>

86
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being overly optimistic about </v>

87
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.191
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know perfectly well that people </v>

88
00:04:59.191 --> 00:04:59.191
<v Speaker 1>encounter</v>

89
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.140
<v Speaker 1>impediments during their life that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>find almost impossible to recover from,</v>

90
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's the best shot you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

91
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Jonah runs away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God isn't very happy about that </v>

92
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.831
<v Speaker 1>because it's actually joan as destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's necessary for Jonah to repair the </v>

93
00:05:18.831 --> 00:05:23.601
<v Speaker 1>city so God sends a storm and the waves </v>
<v Speaker 1>are high and and,</v>

94
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.440
<v Speaker 1>and I think what that means is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the water is often a symbol for the </v>

95
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.801
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and that's because things </v>
<v Speaker 1>lurk down there in the water and that </v>

96
00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:37.551
<v Speaker 1>you could pull up that that are useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrous things that you can pull up </v>

97
00:05:37.551 --> 00:05:37.650
<v Speaker 1>their useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can fish for them.</v>

98
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.740
<v Speaker 1>You can go fishing in your own being for</v>
<v Speaker 1>answers,</v>

99
00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:43.080
<v Speaker 1>which is what you do when you try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think right,</v>

100
00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:45.750
<v Speaker 1>you ask yourself a question and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

101
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe an answer appears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

102
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.030
<v Speaker 1>where did that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know what the answer was </v>

103
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.920
<v Speaker 1>before it appeared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it just pop into being out of </v>

104
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.120
<v Speaker 1>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

105
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>So you fish.</v>

106
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.090
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waves come and the boat's going to </v>

107
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.090
<v Speaker 1>be knocked over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens.</v>

108
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.230
<v Speaker 1>I think when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know you should do something.</v>

109
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone has the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe perhaps you would be willing </v>

110
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.510
<v Speaker 1>to put up your hands if this experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>is foreign to you.</v>

111
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This part of you're telling you you </v>

112
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.771
<v Speaker 1>should do something and it's hard to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it effortful and maybe you're afraid of </v>

113
00:06:25.771 --> 00:06:28.120
<v Speaker 1>it and so you don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just procrastinate.</v>

114
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how do you feel about that?</v>

115
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Good mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you feel that you're </v>

116
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.310
<v Speaker 1>betraying yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your anxiety actually gets worse,</v>

117
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:44.311
<v Speaker 1>not better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you know you can put it off </v>

118
00:06:44.311 --> 00:06:44.311
<v Speaker 1>moment to moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't help because every time</v>

119
00:06:44.311 --> 00:06:45.850
<v Speaker 1>you put it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anxiety just grows a little bit.</v>

120
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.940
<v Speaker 1>You're not proud of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a sense that you're making </v>

121
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.150
<v Speaker 1>things more chaotic than they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

122
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.160
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure many of you have had that </v>

123
00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.160
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do that long enough,</v>

124
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.571
<v Speaker 1>if that becomes habitual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things will get so stormy around you </v>

125
00:07:03.571 --> 00:07:05.830
<v Speaker 1>that you'll fall right into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the chaos,</v>

126
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.340
<v Speaker 1>into the watery chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you'll drown.</v>

127
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a very good idea to run from</v>
<v Speaker 1>your destiny.</v>

128
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's say whatever that might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you need a destiny.</v>

129
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:25.091
<v Speaker 1>You needed a place to aim at because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what gives your life meaning and </v>

130
00:07:25.091 --> 00:07:26.270
<v Speaker 1>you need meaning in your life because </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is hard.</v>

131
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.990
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need something to buttress yourself </v>

132
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:31.990
<v Speaker 1>against that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

133
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 1>they wake Jonah and Jonah says hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably my fault because like I'm </v>

134
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.940
<v Speaker 1>running away from something I'm supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do and you know,</v>

135
00:07:38.941 --> 00:07:43.941
<v Speaker 1>God isn't very happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you just throw me over </v>

136
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>overboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the crew isn't very happy about </v>

137
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.251
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the waves are really starting to </v>

138
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:49.290
<v Speaker 1>come up and join is pretty insistent </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's the cause of the problem.</v>

139
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 1>And so they draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they draw lots and,</v>

140
00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 1>and Jonah is chosen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they decided to toss them into </v>

141
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.210
<v Speaker 1>the ocean and immediately everything's </v>
<v Speaker 1>calm.</v>

142
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.680
<v Speaker 1>So he's a center of chaos because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing what he's supposed to do.</v>

143
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then a whale comes up and swallows </v>

144
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he's in the whale for three days.</v>

145
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing.</v>

146
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 1>The whale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way all the was in.</v>

147
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:30.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that thing that you have to go out </v>

148
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:30.570
<v Speaker 1>there and conquer to get something of </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

149
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've made an error,</v>

150
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>when you've</v>

151
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.880
<v Speaker 1>fallen off the pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you deviated from what you know you</v>

152
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:48.881
<v Speaker 1>should do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your produces a state of internal chaos </v>

153
00:08:48.881 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 1>and worry and concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>

154
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.600
<v Speaker 1>You're thrust into the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're thrust into unknown territory and</v>

155
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:55.440
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do.</v>

156
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's often symbolized by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter with a,</v>

157
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 1>with a monster like a dragon or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that lives under the water.</v>

158
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is,</v>

159
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 1>as far as I've been able to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that human beings,</v>

160
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:13.611
<v Speaker 1>because we'd been prey animals for </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever in her battle with carnivorous </v>

161
00:09:13.611 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 1>lizards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

162
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:19.221
<v Speaker 1>and alligators and even dinosaurs </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there were dinosaurs around at </v>

163
00:09:19.221 --> 00:09:23.121
<v Speaker 1>the time of our most distant ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was even a cat at one point </v>

164
00:09:23.121 --> 00:09:27.111
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was adapted with teeth to pierce </v>

165
00:09:27.111 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 1>human skulls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it had a head that was exactly shaped</v>

166
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:34.950
<v Speaker 1>to grab you here and put a two through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back of your skull.</v>

167
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 1>So like we've come through some rough </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

168
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have,</v>

169
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:44.331
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a system in our mind that's a threat </v>

170
00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Predator detection system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that makes little kids </v>

171
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.930
<v Speaker 1>think about monsters in the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

172
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Because while there is monsters in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>

173
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.680
<v Speaker 1>and parents always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

174
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 1>there's no monsters in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

175
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.390
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The darkest full of monsters.</v>

176
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Speaker 1>There might not be any in your room </v>
<v Speaker 1>right at that moment,</v>

177
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.860
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean there aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters in the dark crimes.</v>

178
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Take place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like criminals don't get up at six in </v>

179
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.070
<v Speaker 1>the morning and have breakfast and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>rob a bank.</v>

180
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.410
<v Speaker 1>They do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do that sort of thing at night.</v>

181
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.710
<v Speaker 1>People do the things that are fit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the night in the night and lots of </v>

182
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:25.010
<v Speaker 1>predators are nocturnal and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see very well in the dark and kids </v>

183
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.000
<v Speaker 1>aren't stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

184
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:31.130
<v Speaker 1>they've evolved to stay pretty damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the fire because of the kids </v>

185
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:36.981
<v Speaker 1>that wandered away from the fire got </v>
<v Speaker 1>picked off by hyenas and lions and you </v>

186
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.320
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodiles and whatever else the hell </v>

187
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.560
<v Speaker 1>was out there to eat the unwary.</v>

188
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:45.340
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

189
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:55.060
<v Speaker 1>the circuit that we use to defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves against predators as we've </v>

190
00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:01.880
<v Speaker 1>evolved cortically that circuit has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has come to represent what we don't know</v>

191
00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:05.690
<v Speaker 1>in general because the predators of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course inhabit where we don't know.</v>

192
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:11.350
<v Speaker 1>And so evolution is a conservative force</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we use the circuits that we've </v>

193
00:11:11.661 --> 00:11:15.950
<v Speaker 1>evolved to represent new things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the unknown,</v>

194
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:21.220
<v Speaker 1>the chaos is often represented by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster that swallows you up and pulls </v>

195
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.511
<v Speaker 1>you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know when you're feeling </v>

196
00:11:25.511 --> 00:11:25.511
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't say,</v>

197
00:11:25.511 --> 00:11:26.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling up.</v>

198
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.340
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling down,</v>

199
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

200
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:30.920
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

201
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.880
<v Speaker 1>down is worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you're flat on the ground when </v>

202
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:36.890
<v Speaker 1>you're down or you're in a hole or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

203
00:11:36.891 --> 00:11:40.820
<v Speaker 1>You're hiding in a hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's down and you're threatened</v>

204
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:45.821
<v Speaker 1>by something you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're threatened by your own </v>

205
00:11:45.821 --> 00:11:46.040
<v Speaker 1>inadequacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be part of it.</v>

206
00:11:46.041 --> 00:11:51.041
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's partly what you imagine as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a monstrous force because you know your </v>

207
00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:55.510
<v Speaker 1>proclivity towards press procrastination</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your weakness of character is part </v>

208
00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.301
<v Speaker 1>and parcel of why you happen to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the underworld and that's the </v>

209
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:02.320
<v Speaker 1>underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mythological underworld.</v>

210
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.610
<v Speaker 1>That's where you go when things fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>

211
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 1>and if you understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know that that's what that means,</v>

212
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.930
<v Speaker 1>then you have one of the keys that opens</v>
<v Speaker 1>up ancient stories to you and you </v>

213
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 1>understand things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your life can be an organized,</v>

214
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.590
<v Speaker 1>going very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then something comes up and poof.</v>

215
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Everything changes.</v>

216
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Some axiom that you were living by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be the existence of a partner,</v>

217
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.290
<v Speaker 1>might be a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but might be your health.</v>

218
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Any of those things go on and you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

219
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.330
<v Speaker 1>When that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go somewhere,</v>

220
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a state of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still in the same world,</v>

221
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:46.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same at all anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything about it is different.</v>

222
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.930
<v Speaker 1>It's all negative and dark and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what to do and you're confused and </v>

223
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:56.191
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do down there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld when things have fallen </v>

224
00:12:56.191 --> 00:12:59.770
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if if it's the worst possible</v>

225
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:04.771
<v Speaker 1>case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you realize that you actually had </v>

226
00:13:04.771 --> 00:13:05.530
<v Speaker 1>something to do with your demise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really annoying.</v>

227
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.850
<v Speaker 1>You know when something bad happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and then you know you grind yourself</v>

228
00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:13.810
<v Speaker 1>into bits trying to figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell happened and then you realize that,</v>

229
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were playing a causal role.</v>

230
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Now sometimes you're so depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You assume you're playing a causal role </v>

231
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.310
<v Speaker 1>and your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to figure out by any </v>

232
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.441
<v Speaker 1>stretch of the imagination and it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone who does something </v>

233
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:31.981
<v Speaker 1>terrible is at fault for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you find that you are off </v>

234
00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:37.711
<v Speaker 1>the path somehow and maybe even that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew it and he didn't attend to it and </v>

235
00:13:37.711 --> 00:13:41.821
<v Speaker 1>that's why all of this hit the fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then down there in that chaos,</v>

236
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:47.610
<v Speaker 1>you decide that you're going to do what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to do instead and then </v>

237
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:52.030
<v Speaker 1>maybe you get to rise up again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>renewed if you're lucky,</v>

238
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.660
<v Speaker 1>and then you can go fix the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what this story's about.</v>

239
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I picked the image to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the chorus.</v>

240
00:14:02.921 --> 00:14:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Because really what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see with the psychoanalysts,</v>

241
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.920
<v Speaker 1>the road due to health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not doing well,</v>

242
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.440
<v Speaker 1>which means that as you act in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

243
00:14:13.441 --> 00:14:16.850
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong with your,</v>

244
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.460
<v Speaker 1>the match between your presuppositions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your actions,</v>

245
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.610
<v Speaker 1>habitual and the way the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>responding to you.</v>

246
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.900
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not turning out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

247
00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:29.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can you do about that?</v>

248
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:35.060
<v Speaker 1>And one answer might be to examine </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself for presuppositions and action </v>

249
00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.891
<v Speaker 1>patterns that are not serving you well </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to find out what they are and what </v>

250
00:14:39.891 --> 00:14:44.421
<v Speaker 1>to do about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe some of that is maybe you're </v>

251
00:14:44.421 --> 00:14:46.970
<v Speaker 1>not moving forward because of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's theory is grounded in </v>

252
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:50.481
<v Speaker 1>terrible experiences that you had in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past that you've never been able to </v>

253
00:14:50.481 --> 00:14:53.451
<v Speaker 1>understand and maybe one of the ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself back together and expanding </v>

254
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 1>your personality so that you could in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact live properly in the world,</v>

255
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.860
<v Speaker 1>is to go back to those terrible events </v>
<v Speaker 1>and untie them and straighten them out </v>

256
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:09.761
<v Speaker 1>and understand them and drop them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what psychotherapy is about.</v>

257
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:12.590
<v Speaker 1>In large part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic,</v>

258
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 1>behavioral doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you afraid of?</v>

259
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.070
<v Speaker 1>What are you avoiding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you failing to develop?</v>

260
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe from fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe from avoidance,</v>

261
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:23.750
<v Speaker 1>God only knows maybe from disgust.</v>

262
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.540
<v Speaker 1>How can you get over it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you reclaim those parts of your </v>

263
00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:31.540
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>
