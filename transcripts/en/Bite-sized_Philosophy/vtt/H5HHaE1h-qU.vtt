1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.390
<v Speaker 1>You definitely have a responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your partner and your children.</v>

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your responsibility to your children </v>

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is don't.</v>

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>It's twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.050
<v Speaker 1>don't let your children do anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you dislike the and there's a </v>

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>corollary to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is don't be an idiot.</v>

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's partly why you need a partner </v>

8
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.511
<v Speaker 1>because your partner has to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>when your demands on your children are </v>

9
00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>excessive because you're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>you're not 100 percent oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

11
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.170
<v Speaker 1>but still you're their target adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's up to you to help them </v>

12
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>choose a path that makes you want them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be around right?</v>

13
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>And that that's your critical </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and hopefully your enough</v>

14
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:50.841
<v Speaker 1>of an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an analog of the broader community so </v>

15
00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>that if they can figure out how to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with you,</v>

16
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:56.691
<v Speaker 1>it radically increases the probability </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the ability to get along with </v>

17
00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:56.691
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

18
00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're playing with your children two</v>

19
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

20
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 1>you help them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you encourage them to play in a manner </v>

21
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 1>that's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you get that down,</v>

22
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:09.860
<v Speaker 1>then you know when you introduce them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>another child,</v>

23
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>don't know how to play in a manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fun and so great,</v>

24
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>you've solved the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is to get your child to </v>

25
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>enter into the collaborative social </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

26
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>And so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a primary responsibility for </v>

27
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then with regards to your partner,</v>

28
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 1>here's something to think about with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to rules.</v>

29
00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:32.611
<v Speaker 1>So my wife and I have had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion many times and one of the </v>

30
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:35.481
<v Speaker 1>discussions as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are we to treat each other in </v>

31
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:35.481
<v Speaker 1>public?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't.</v>

32
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Her name is Tammy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The discussion isn't how should Jordan </v>

33
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>treat Tammy and public?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or how should tammy treat Jordan?</v>

34
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.330
<v Speaker 1>That's not the discussion.</v>

35
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Speaker 1>This isn't personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how should a wife treat her </v>

36
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>husband?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how should a husband treat his wife?</v>

37
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 1>It's impersonal and it's partly you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't put your partner down in public.</v>

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>it's not because you're hurting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>persons feelings.</v>

40
00:01:57.151 --> 00:02:02.151
<v Speaker 1>That's not why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that you're denigrating the </v>

41
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>relationship that you are involuntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

42
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I've some of the most painful days I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever spent.</v>

43
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>One night in particular I spent with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of men who had been in therapy for</v>

44
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>their marriage and who bloody well </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed it.</v>

45
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:16.581
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they spent their whole day </v>

46
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:19.671
<v Speaker 1>complaining about their wives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could just made me sweat the whole </v>

47
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:19.671
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

48
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm here with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you.</v>

49
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Why was it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>it was just happenstance more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and I thought,</v>

51
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>how can you be so damn dumb?</v>

52
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's certainly possible that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you marriage barbara married barbarian </v>

53
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.951
<v Speaker 1>witches fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have your so lacking in </v>

54
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>sense that you would discuss that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>public,</v>

55
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>not noticing that you pick them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically all you're doing is holding</v>

56
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>up a sign and waving it constantly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

57
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idiot.</v>

58
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so well,</v>

59
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Responsibility,</v>

60
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>you have a responsibility to those whom </v>
<v Speaker 1>you love and are obligated to,</v>

61
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.180
<v Speaker 1>to ensure that they manifest themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a manner that's most beneficial to </v>

62
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 1>them over the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have the same responsibility.</v>

63
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>I would say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll have blind spots.</v>

64
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Other people have to help you with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so the rule is you know,</v>

65
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.540
<v Speaker 1>you don't let you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you help your wife figure out how </v>

66
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.381
<v Speaker 1>not to make a fool of herself in public </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she extends to you the same </v>

67
00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:29.851
<v Speaker 1>courtesy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly maintenance of the </v>

68
00:03:29.851 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>sacred nature of the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with you or her.</v>

69
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's broader and wider than that.</v>
