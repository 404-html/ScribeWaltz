1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.490
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you said about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow,</v>

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.270
<v Speaker 1>and this is I would say one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary impediments to enlightenment is </v>

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.250
<v Speaker 1>that if you start looking at your </v>
<v Speaker 1>motives for,</v>

4
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.890
<v Speaker 1>for misbehaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>and I mean by that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something very specific.</v>

6
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:19.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that you're misbehaving by </v>

7
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:19.761
<v Speaker 1>someone else's standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that.</v>

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you know by your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards that you're doing something </v>

9
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>that's devious or malevolent or </v>
<v Speaker 1>underhanded,</v>

10
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:31.011
<v Speaker 1>you know it and you still do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's your own judgment you're </v>

11
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>bringing to bear on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at why you're doing that,</v>

12
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>the longer you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deeper a hole you dig.</v>

13
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>And so this is the Motif of Dante's </v>
<v Speaker 1>inferno fundamentally.</v>

14
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:46.390
<v Speaker 1>So Dante's inferno is a story about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember his name unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be Dante,</v>

16
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I don't remember.</v>

17
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>He's led into hell by Virgil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an,</v>

18
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>who's an ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is an ancient philosopher,</v>

19
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>thinker and hell has levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the outer level is,</v>

20
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>and this is a Christianized version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell because there's hills of all sorts,</v>

21
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>but this is a christianized virgin </v>
<v Speaker 1>version.</v>

22
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>And so the on the outermost levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell,</v>

23
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like normal life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the ancient philosophers,</v>

24
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>so they're still in hell because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't Christian,</v>

25
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:23.901
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like cheap motel hell instead of </v>

26
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 1>the full pip thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

27
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 1>And so then Dante goes deeper and deeper</v>
<v Speaker 1>into hell until he gets right to the </v>

28
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 1>bottom of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a while since I read it,</v>

29
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:38.871
<v Speaker 1>but if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan himself is encased in ice at the </v>

30
00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>bottom of hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by people who betray others.</v>

31
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.190
<v Speaker 1>And so Dante,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his notion was that the worst of all </v>

32
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.011
<v Speaker 1>possible violations of moral behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>was be trail and that they're in the </v>

33
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>deepest levels of hell.</v>

34
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 1>And I really liked that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's true because if you trust </v>

35
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.751
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're manifesting the necessary </v>

36
00:01:59.751 --> 00:01:59.751
<v Speaker 1>courage that put someone through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>if you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't trust because you're naive.</v>

38
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 1>You Trust me knowing that I've full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes and so are you.</v>

39
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>But maybe we could cooperate and move </v>
<v Speaker 1>things along nicely.</v>

40
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 1>We know and we could reduce each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the word to our word.</v>

41
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 1>And we could cooperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're awake,</v>

42
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'd be trey that then I'm </v>

43
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.591
<v Speaker 1>undermining your necessary faith in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and humanity and you can really hurt </v>

44
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>someone that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes it's self be trail,</v>

45
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>but you can really do someone in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can really traumatize them,</v>

46
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.670
<v Speaker 1>they can so that they can't recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a really terrible thing to </v>

47
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.361
<v Speaker 1>do to someone and maybe it's the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and that was don taste idea and </v>

48
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:41.361
<v Speaker 1>it's tied in.</v>

49
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker 1>That makes very interesting reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you read it at the same time as </v>

50
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Milton's paradise lost because those are</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical explorations.</v>

51
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>This is what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're metaphysical explorations of the</v>

52
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:57.261
<v Speaker 1>terrible places you can end up and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do end up and also a metaphysical</v>

53
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>explanation of what spirit takes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

54
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>So because you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why'd you betray someone?</v>

55
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>And that is a deep question and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have your specific reasons.</v>

56
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>But under that there'll be some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

57
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>And under that there'll be some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

58
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>And under that there'll be some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

59
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.490
<v Speaker 1>And if you go all the way to the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come up with the ultimate reasons </v>

60
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>why you'd be trade someone and when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that,</v>

61
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>that will not be pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when your proclivity for evil,</v>

62
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:30.301
<v Speaker 1>let's say you nights with the general </v>
<v Speaker 1>human proclivity for evil and you </v>

63
00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>discover just exactly what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of.</v>

64
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.830
<v Speaker 1>And so humans notion was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that was a full encounter with the </v>

65
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.491
<v Speaker 1>shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I suppose partly what this </v>

66
00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:43.411
<v Speaker 1>course is about because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I believe I told you at the </v>

67
00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:47.251
<v Speaker 1>beginning was that I was going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help you understand how it might be that</v>

68
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:52.651
<v Speaker 1>you could be an Auschwitz guard and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really understand that that's a </v>

69
00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>horrifying thing to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you,</v>

70
00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.810
<v Speaker 1>if you want to grow some teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good thing to </v>

71
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.201
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were talking about your capacity </v>

72
00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>to negotiate before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you aren't a monster,</v>

73
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 1>you cannot negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

74
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.880
<v Speaker 1>if you've got that under control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to be a monster.</v>

75
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>It's really paradoxical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're just naive,</v>

76
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>well you end up in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And marionette master has control over </v>

77
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not helpful.</v>

78
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.210
<v Speaker 1>So that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just means you're useless and you </v>

79
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.061
<v Speaker 1>can be manipulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't go out of your way to be </v>

80
00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:35.251
<v Speaker 1>malevolent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's mostly because you just don't </v>

81
00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:35.251
<v Speaker 1>have the skills or the organizational </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills or,</v>

82
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.470
<v Speaker 1>or even the depth to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're good because you're </v>

83
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

84
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>That's easily manipulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>

85
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 1>well how do you get out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

86
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:50.791
<v Speaker 1>partly you watch people that because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what they're like because you know </v>

87
00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:54.901
<v Speaker 1>what you're like and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also know what you could do and </v>

88
00:04:54.901 --> 00:04:59.041
<v Speaker 1>would do if you were pushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't have to show much of </v>

89
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:02.281
<v Speaker 1>that when you're negotiating with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone for them to take you really </v>

90
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a strange thing,</v>

91
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:09.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things you pointed out </v>

92
00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:11.071
<v Speaker 1>too was that what you most need to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be found where you least want to </v>

93
00:05:11.071 --> 00:05:15.961
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because you haven't already </v>

94
00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:15.961
<v Speaker 1>looked there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a little different for every</v>

95
00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

96
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:21.721
<v Speaker 1>Because your particular place you'd want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look isn't going to be the same as </v>

97
00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:24.871
<v Speaker 1>your place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have a place you </v>

98
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:24.910
<v Speaker 1>don't want to look and what you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered.</v>

99
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:29.911
<v Speaker 1>That's where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's partly going to be </v>

100
00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:31.210
<v Speaker 1>discovered by you looking at what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of,</v>

101
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 1>what you're truly capable of.</v>
