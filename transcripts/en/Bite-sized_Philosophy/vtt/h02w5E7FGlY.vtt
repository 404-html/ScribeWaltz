00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Good</v>

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.090
<v Speaker 2>for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnic groups have,</v>

3
00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:13.091
<v Speaker 2>on average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scored significantly differently on Iq </v>

4
00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:16.151
<v Speaker 2>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to psychology professor </v>

5
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:19.211
<v Speaker 2>Richard Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whom you interviewed on your channel </v>

6
00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no scientific consensus on the</v>

7
00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:22.490
<v Speaker 2>causes of these average differences in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iq test scores.</v>

8
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to Haier,</v>

9
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 2>psychologists do generally agree that </v>
<v Speaker 2>general intelligence exists that Iq </v>

10
00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:34.721
<v Speaker 2>measures that well and in a non </v>
<v Speaker 2>culturally biased way that Iq is highly </v>

11
00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:39.641
<v Speaker 2>predictive of success and educational </v>
<v Speaker 2>and professional terms and that for </v>

12
00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:41.420
<v Speaker 2>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnic groups have on average,</v>

13
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:45.080
<v Speaker 2>scored significantly differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So assuming this is true,</v>

14
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.140
<v Speaker 2>should we talk about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris raised this question and a </v>

15
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 2>podcast conversation with Charles </v>
<v Speaker 2>Murray.</v>

16
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Some argue that we should not talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this as doing so could fuel the racial </v>

17
00:00:57.051 --> 00:01:01.370
<v Speaker 2>supremacist movements that you mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 2>with potentially horrific consequences.</v>

18
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Others mainly on the intellectual dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>web and to a very limited extent in </v>

19
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:11.831
<v Speaker 2>academia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should talk about this topic </v>

20
00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:13.580
<v Speaker 2>because average differences in Iq scores</v>
<v Speaker 2>have existed for decades.</v>

21
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 2>They may have played a role in </v>
<v Speaker 2>generating the disparate educational and</v>

22
00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:21.380
<v Speaker 2>professional outcomes that we observe </v>
<v Speaker 2>and care about,</v>

23
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.860
<v Speaker 2>and thus that we cannot properly analyze</v>
<v Speaker 2>these disparate outcomes unless we do </v>

24
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 2>talk about the subject openly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Geneticists,</v>

25
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.630
<v Speaker 2>David Reich recently argued in the New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York Times that have scientists do not </v>

26
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 2>openly discuss the biological basis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

27
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Pseudo scientists could fill the vacuum </v>
<v Speaker 2>with dangerous consequences.</v>

28
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

29
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:48.191
<v Speaker 2>Professor Peterson are highly critical </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the oppression narrative that </v>

30
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:52.841
<v Speaker 2>permeates segments of the academy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>activist left and knowledge about </v>

31
00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:56.450
<v Speaker 2>average differences in Iq scores between</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnic groups,</v>

32
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.990
<v Speaker 2>while tough to assimilate could puncture</v>
<v Speaker 2>this narrative.</v>

33
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.560
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your view on all that?</v>

34
00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:05.270
<v Speaker 2>I've just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

35
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.220
<v Speaker 3>you guys already didn't take a long time</v>
<v Speaker 3>to prepare these questions.</v>

36
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 3>Didn't know.</v>

37
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

38
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 3>when I went to Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came from mcgill and I had spent a lot</v>

39
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:25.881
<v Speaker 3>of time with my advisor there and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>research team that he had trying to </v>

40
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:32.151
<v Speaker 3>understand the genesis of antisocial </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior and him among adolescents,</v>

41
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:38.481
<v Speaker 3>mostly so well as kids as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's antisocial behavior is very </v>

42
00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:42.771
<v Speaker 3>persistent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you have a child whose conduct </v>

43
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:45.051
<v Speaker 3>disordered at the age of four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the probability that they will be </v>

44
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 3>criminal at the age of 15 or 20 is </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely high.</v>

45
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.120
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievably stable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very dismal literature because </v>

46
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.230
<v Speaker 3>you see these early onset aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids and and it's persistent and then </v>

47
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:03.201
<v Speaker 3>you look at the intervention literature </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you throw up your hands because no </v>

48
00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:07.381
<v Speaker 3>interventions work and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologists have tried everything you </v>

49
00:03:07.381 --> 00:03:10.921
<v Speaker 3>could possibly imagine and a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you can't in order to </v>

50
00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:14.641
<v Speaker 3>ameliorate that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're really interested in trying to </v>

51
00:03:14.641 --> 00:03:14.641
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

52
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.920
<v Speaker 3>if you're antisocial by the age of four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there isn't an intervention that </v>

53
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 3>seems to be effective.</v>

54
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the standard penal logical theory is</v>

55
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:29.341
<v Speaker 3>really quite horrifying in this regard </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what you see is that male </v>

56
00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:33.241
<v Speaker 3>aggression peaks around the age of 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it declines fairly </v>

57
00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:33.241
<v Speaker 3>precipitously and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

58
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 3>and sort of normalizes again by the age </v>
<v Speaker 3>of 27.</v>

59
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 3>And Standard penal logical theory </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially is this cold hearted.</v>

60
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:45.181
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you have a mold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have someone who is a multiple </v>

61
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:48.451
<v Speaker 3>offender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just throw them in prison til </v>

62
00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:48.451
<v Speaker 3>they're 27,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the age out of it,</v>

63
00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 3>and that's all there is to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we've got.</v>

64
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.060
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some downside to that because </v>

65
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.771
<v Speaker 3>there's a corollary literature that </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggests that the worst thing that you </v>

66
00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 3>can do with antisocial people is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>group them together,</v>

67
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.690
<v Speaker 3>which is what we do in prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

68
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 3>so that's a whole mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>

69
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.240
<v Speaker 3>One of the things we were doing was </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to see if there might be </v>

70
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 3>cognitive predictors of antisocial </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

71
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.850
<v Speaker 3>And so we use this battery of </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuropsychological tests that was put </v>

72
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 3>together at the Montreal Neurological </v>
<v Speaker 3>Institute,</v>

73
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.180
<v Speaker 3>took about 11 hours to administer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothetically assessed prefrontal </v>

74
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 3>cortical function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We computerized that,</v>

75
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:28.171
<v Speaker 3>reduced it to about 90 minutes and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>assessed antisocial adolescents in </v>

76
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 3>Montreal and found out that they did </v>
<v Speaker 3>show deficits in problem solving ability</v>

77
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 3>that we were associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

78
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.880
<v Speaker 3>with prefrontal ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

79
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.510
<v Speaker 3>when I got to Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

80
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>

81
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 3>We could use the neuro psych battery to </v>
<v Speaker 3>predict negative behavior.</v>

82
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.210
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps we could use it to predict </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive behavior.</v>

83
00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

84
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 3>what if we turned the neuro psych </v>
<v Speaker 3>battery and over and thought,</v>

85
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.650
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we predict grades,</v>

86
00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:57.910
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

87
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 3>that's a decent thing to predict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we ran a study,</v>

88
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.000
<v Speaker 3>we ran a study that looked at Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>

89
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:09.001
<v Speaker 3>University of Toronto kids line workers </v>
<v Speaker 3>at a Milwaukee factory and managers and </v>

90
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 3>executives at the same factory.</v>

91
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.170
<v Speaker 3>And what we found was that the average </v>
<v Speaker 3>score across these neuropsychological </v>

92
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 3>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were kind of like games.</v>

93
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:19.660
<v Speaker 3>They were game like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

94
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:22.350
<v Speaker 3>So in one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in one test you had,</v>

95
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 3>there were five lights in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the screen and a box was associated with</v>

96
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.960
<v Speaker 3>each light and you had to learn by trial</v>
<v Speaker 3>and error,</v>

97
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 3>which box was associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with each light.</v>

98
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

99
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.210
<v Speaker 3>so we took people's average score across</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tests because they seem to clump </v>

100
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 3>together into a single structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do,</v>

101
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 3>you can find that out statistically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take a bunch of tests,</v>

102
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.850
<v Speaker 3>you can find out how they clumped </v>
<v Speaker 3>together statistically by looking at </v>

103
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 3>their patterns of correlations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you might get multiple clumps,</v>

104
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 3>which is what happens with personality </v>
<v Speaker 3>research where you get five or you might</v>

105
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Speaker 3>get a singular clump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what happens.</v>

106
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 3>Cognitive research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we got a single clump essentially.</v>

107
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.430
<v Speaker 3>And then we were trying to figure out if</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time I was reading the </v>

108
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.631
<v Speaker 3>literature on performance prediction and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an extensive literature on </v>

109
00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:14.561
<v Speaker 3>performance prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it generated by the armed </v>

110
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:14.561
<v Speaker 3>forces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

111
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm indicating that ICU is a very good </v>
<v Speaker 3>predictor of longterm life success.</v>

112
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 3>And so here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the general rule.</v>

113
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.860
<v Speaker 3>If your job is simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means you do the same thing every </v>

114
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 3>day than Iq predicts how fast you'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn the job,</v>

115
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 3>but not how well you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if your job is complex,</v>

116
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.220
<v Speaker 3>which means that the demands change on </v>
<v Speaker 3>an ongoing basis,</v>

117
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 3>then the best predictor of success is </v>
<v Speaker 3>general cognitive ability.</v>

118
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I learned that the general cognitive</v>

119
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:46.061
<v Speaker 3>ability tests clump together into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>single factor that's fluid intelligence </v>

120
00:06:46.061 --> 00:06:49.980
<v Speaker 3>or Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we didn't know if the factor </v>

121
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 3>that we had found was the same factor as</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq and it.</v>

122
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.590
<v Speaker 3>And we still haven't really figured out </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not that was the case because</v>

123
00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 3>it kind of depends on how you do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis.</v>

124
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.840
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got deeply into the performance </v>

125
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.631
<v Speaker 3>prediction literature and I found out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if you wanted to predict people's </v>

126
00:07:04.631 --> 00:07:04.631
<v Speaker 3>performance in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

127
00:07:04.631 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of things you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

128
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 3>You need to know their general cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability.</v>

129
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 3>If they're going to do a complex job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to know their trait.</v>

130
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:16.151
<v Speaker 3>Conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of you might've heard that </v>

131
00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:17.630
<v Speaker 3>rebranded as grit in a very corrupt act </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

132
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a good predictor of </v>

133
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 3>longterm life success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom from negative emotion.</v>

134
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 3>Low neuroticism is another predictor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's sort of third on the hierarchy.</v>

135
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:31.100
<v Speaker 3>And then openness to experience which is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a personality trait,</v>

136
00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 3>is associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with expertise in creative domains.</v>

137
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.190
<v Speaker 3>The evidence that now I should tell you.</v>

138
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:42.370
<v Speaker 3>So it's such a complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should tell you how to make an Iq </v>

139
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.581
<v Speaker 3>test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually really easy and you need </v>

140
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:45.620
<v Speaker 3>to know this to actually understand what</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq is.</v>

141
00:07:45.621 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that you generated a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a set of 10,000</v>

142
00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 3>questions about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be math problems,</v>

143
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 3>they could be general knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could be vocabulary,</v>

144
00:07:56.361 --> 00:08:01.361
<v Speaker 3>that could be multiple choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really doesn't matter what they're </v>

145
00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 3>about as long as they require </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstraction to solve,</v>

146
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 3>so they'd be formulated linguistically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mathematically would also apply.</v>

147
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 3>And then you have those 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

148
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.960
<v Speaker 3>Now you take a random set of 100 of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those questions and you give them to a </v>

149
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.300
<v Speaker 3>thousand people and all you do is sum up</v>
<v Speaker 3>the answers right from so some people </v>

150
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.231
<v Speaker 3>are going to get most of them right and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of some of them are going to get </v>

151
00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:23.231
<v Speaker 3>most of them wrong.</v>

152
00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:23.870
<v Speaker 3>You just rank order the people in terms </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their score,</v>

153
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 3>correct that for age and you have Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all there is to it.</v>

154
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.180
<v Speaker 3>And what you'll find is that no matter </v>
<v Speaker 3>which random set of 100 questions you </v>

155
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.111
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people at the top of one random set </v>

156
00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 3>will be at the top of all the others and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it with very,</v>

157
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:41.000
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very high consistency.</v>

158
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:46.210
<v Speaker 3>So one thing you need to know is that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>any social science claims whatsoever are</v>

159
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:51.581
<v Speaker 3>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the ICU claims are correct because </v>

160
00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:57.101
<v Speaker 3>the ICU claims are more psychometrically</v>
<v Speaker 3>rigorous than any other phenomena </v>

161
00:08:57.101 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 3>phenomena that's been discovered by </v>
<v Speaker 3>social scientists.</v>

162
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.880
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ICU literature is a dismal </v>

163
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:04.880
<v Speaker 3>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one likes it.</v>

164
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 3>Here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's an example.</v>

165
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 3>So here's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a fun little fact for you,</v>

166
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.730
<v Speaker 3>for Liberals and conservatives alike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because conservatives think there's a </v>

167
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:13.730
<v Speaker 3>job for everyone.</v>

168
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.420
<v Speaker 3>If people just get off their asses and </v>
<v Speaker 3>get the work and liberals think while </v>

169
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:17.850
<v Speaker 3>you can train anyone to do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

170
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.060
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there isn't a job for everyone and no,</v>

171
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.240
<v Speaker 3>you can't train everyone to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that's wrong.</v>

172
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.670
<v Speaker 3>And here's one of the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

173
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:32.210
<v Speaker 3>So as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Armed Forces has done a lot of work </v>

174
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.330
<v Speaker 3>on ICU when they started back in 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19.</v>

175
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 3>And the reason they did that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

176
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.280
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for obvious reasons,</v>

177
00:09:36.281 --> 00:09:41.281
<v Speaker 3>say let's say there's a war and you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get qualified people into the officer</v>

178
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 3>positions as rapidly as possible or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll lose.</v>

179
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.860
<v Speaker 3>So that's a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

180
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:50.790
<v Speaker 3>the armed forces has experimented with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq tests since 19,</v>

181
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:55.791
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the last 20 years I'm a law was </v>

182
00:09:55.791 --> 00:09:57.150
<v Speaker 3>passed as a consequence of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis,</v>

183
00:09:57.151 --> 00:10:02.151
<v Speaker 3>which was that it was illegal to induct </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone into the armed forces who had an </v>

184
00:10:02.151 --> 00:10:02.550
<v Speaker 3>Iq of less than 83.</v>

185
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.840
<v Speaker 3>Now the question is why and the answer </v>
<v Speaker 3>was all of that effort put in by the </v>

186
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:11.970
<v Speaker 3>armed forces indicated that if you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>an Iq of 83 or less,</v>

187
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:16.971
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't anything that you could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained to do in the military that </v>

188
00:10:16.971 --> 00:10:18.630
<v Speaker 3>wasn't positively counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you got to think about that a,</v>

189
00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:23.230
<v Speaker 3>because the military is chronically </v>
<v Speaker 3>desperate for people right there.</v>

190
00:10:23.231 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they're so like people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>lining up to be inducted,</v>

191
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to go out and recruit and it's</v>

192
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:33.891
<v Speaker 3>not easy and so they're desperate to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>their hands on every body they can </v>

193
00:10:33.891 --> 00:10:36.030
<v Speaker 3>possibly manage and then especially in </v>
<v Speaker 3>war time,</v>

194
00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:38.580
<v Speaker 3>but also in peacetime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then there was another reason too,</v>

195
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:43.581
<v Speaker 3>which was the armed forces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was also set up from a policy </v>

196
00:10:43.581 --> 00:10:44.640
<v Speaker 3>perspective to take people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>underclass,</v>

197
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:47.610
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and train them and move them up at least</v>

198
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.350
<v Speaker 3>into the working class or maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle class.</v>

199
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 3>So there's a policy element to it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so even from that perspective,</v>

200
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:56.040
<v Speaker 3>you could see that the military is </v>
<v Speaker 3>desperate to bring people in,</v>

201
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 3>but it well with an Iq of 83 or less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not happening.</v>

202
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how many people have an Iq of 83 or </v>

203
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:05.900
<v Speaker 3>less?</v>

204
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.640
<v Speaker 3>Ten percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

205
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:09.570
<v Speaker 3>if that doesn't,</v>

206
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.110
<v Speaker 3>if that doesn't hurt you to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you didn't hear it properly.</v>

207
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.450
<v Speaker 3>Because what it implies is that in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex society like ours and one that's</v>

208
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:26.451
<v Speaker 3>becoming increasingly complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there isn't anything for 10 percent of </v>

209
00:11:26.451 --> 00:11:28.770
<v Speaker 3>the population to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

210
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.660
<v Speaker 3>well what are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to ignore that.</v>

211
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.570
<v Speaker 3>We're going to run away from that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe me,</v>

212
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:38.571
<v Speaker 3>we have every reason to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or we're going to contend with the fact </v>

213
00:11:38.571 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 3>that we need to figure out how it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it is,</v>

214
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:45.020
<v Speaker 3>how it might be possible to find a place</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people on the lower end of the </v>

215
00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:50.931
<v Speaker 3>general cognitive distribution to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>their productive and worthwhile place in</v>

216
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that isn't just going to a matter of</v>

217
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:58.741
<v Speaker 3>dumping money down the hierarchy because</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving people who have nothing to do </v>

218
00:11:58.741 --> 00:12:01.000
<v Speaker 3>money isn't helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work.</v>

219
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.910
<v Speaker 3>It's not that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

220
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.600
<v Speaker 3>so that's kind of an answer to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>question of whether or not we should </v>

221
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:09.600
<v Speaker 3>deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

222
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.330
<v Speaker 3>with Iq forthrightly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

223
00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.720
<v Speaker 3>if you can find a flaw in that logic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just go right ahead.</v>

224
00:12:14.721 --> 00:12:18.030
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I was thrilled to death to</v>
<v Speaker 3>discover all of this by nose,</v>

225
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.630
<v Speaker 3>by no stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that the case?</v>

226
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.750
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what?</v>

227
00:12:23.751 --> 00:12:27.890
<v Speaker 3>So Iq is reliable and valid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the first thing.</v>

228
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.090
<v Speaker 3>It's more reliable and valid than any </v>
<v Speaker 3>other psychometric test ever designed by</v>

229
00:12:32.091 --> 00:12:35.540
<v Speaker 3>social scientists by a factor of about </v>
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

230
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:41.350
<v Speaker 3>That's fact number one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fact number two is it predicts longterm </v>

231
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.880
<v Speaker 3>life outcome at about point three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point four,</v>

232
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:49.090
<v Speaker 3>which leaves about 85 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>70 to 85 percent of the story </v>

233
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.661
<v Speaker 3>unexplained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still the best thing that we </v>

234
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:52.661
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

235
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:54.530
<v Speaker 3>it's also the case that in places like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Great Britain,</v>

236
00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:00.310
<v Speaker 3>when Iq tests were first introduced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were actually used by the </v>

237
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.641
<v Speaker 3>socialists and they were used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>identify poor people who had potential </v>

238
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.880
<v Speaker 3>cognitive potential and to move them </v>
<v Speaker 3>into higher Ed Institutes of higher </v>

239
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.850
<v Speaker 3>education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's an upside,</v>

240
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social upside as well.</v>

241
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.530
<v Speaker 3>Ethnic differences.</v>

242
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:23.010
<v Speaker 3>This is something you can't say anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>about without without immediately being </v>

243
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm hesitant to broach the topic,</v>

244
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:31.530
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you one thing that I did </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the last week that's relevant to </v>

245
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:31.530
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

246
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 3>and this just shows you how complex the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem is.</v>

247
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:39.120
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should point out that race is a very </v>

248
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.250
<v Speaker 3>difficult thing to define because racial</v>
<v Speaker 3>boundaries aren't tight,</v>

249
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

250
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.480
<v Speaker 3>and so when you talk about racial </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences in Iq,</v>

251
00:13:43.481 --> 00:13:48.481
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're faced with a thorny problem of </v>

252
00:13:48.481 --> 00:13:50.551
<v Speaker 3>defining race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a big problem from a </v>

253
00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:52.771
<v Speaker 3>scientific perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we'll leave that aside and I wrote </v>

254
00:13:52.771 --> 00:13:56.500
<v Speaker 3>an article this week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody stood up at one point,</v>

255
00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:00.400
<v Speaker 3>one of my talks and vice bless their </v>
<v Speaker 3>hearts,</v>

256
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:05.820
<v Speaker 3>took this particular question and used </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as an indication of the quality of </v>

257
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.360
<v Speaker 3>the people who are my so called </v>
<v Speaker 3>followers.</v>

258
00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:10.090
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quality of my so called followers is</v>

259
00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 3>pretty damn high.</v>

260
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:16.410
<v Speaker 3>And you can find that out quite rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 3>just by going looking at the youtube </v>

261
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.281
<v Speaker 3>comments which are head and shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 3>above what the standard set of youtube </v>

262
00:14:20.281 --> 00:14:20.740
<v Speaker 3>comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that.</v>

263
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.090
<v Speaker 3>So someone asked me that both the Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>

264
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

265
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:31.650
<v Speaker 3>the implication it was actually someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish and the implication was that Jews</v>

266
00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:36.480
<v Speaker 3>are overrepresented in positions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>authority and power and,</v>

267
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:42.100
<v Speaker 3>and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had just spoken for like an hour and a </v>

268
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.211
<v Speaker 3>half and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy had an ax to grind and I </v>

269
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:45.790
<v Speaker 3>thought there is no God damn way I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting into this at the moment.</v>

270
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.740
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I'm.</v>

271
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.630
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't answer that question,</v>

272
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.080
<v Speaker 3>but that's not a very good answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wrote a blog post this week and I </v>

273
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.080
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

274
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.610
<v Speaker 3>here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the situation.</v>

275
00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.630
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jews are overrepresented in positions of</v>

276
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.660
<v Speaker 3>power and authority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then let's open our eyes a little </v>

277
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:04.660
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

278
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.110
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank for like two or three seconds and </v>

279
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.110
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

280
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.021
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're also overrepresented in </v>

281
00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:12.380
<v Speaker 3>positions of competence and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>like we have more geniuses.</v>

282
00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:17.381
<v Speaker 3>Then we know what to do with and if the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jews happened to be producing more of </v>

283
00:15:17.381 --> 00:15:17.381
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they are,</v>

284
00:15:17.381 --> 00:15:22.181
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's a pretty good thing for the </v>

285
00:15:22.181 --> 00:15:24.731
<v Speaker 3>rest of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's not confuse competence with </v>

286
00:15:24.731 --> 00:15:27.611
<v Speaker 3>power and authority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though that's a favorite trick of </v>

287
00:15:27.611 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 3>the radical leftists who always failed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make that distinction.</v>

288
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does this over representation occur?</v>

289
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:37.330
<v Speaker 3>Because it does it also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also overrepresentation in </v>

290
00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Speaker 3>political movements including radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>political movements.</v>

291
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

292
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>answer one Jewish conspiracy.</v>

293
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a very good answer.</v>

294
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.830
<v Speaker 3>We've had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've used that answer before.</v>

295
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.960
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

296
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.070
<v Speaker 3>but do we have an alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

297
00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:57.071
<v Speaker 3>here's an alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The average Ashkenazi Iq is somewhere </v>

298
00:15:57.071 --> 00:15:58.430
<v Speaker 3>between 1:10</v>
<v Speaker 3>and 1:15,</v>

299
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 3>which is about one standard deviation </v>
<v Speaker 3>above the population average.</v>

300
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.720
<v Speaker 3>And so what that means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>average Ashkenazi Slash European Jew has</v>

301
00:16:08.211 --> 00:16:13.211
<v Speaker 3>an Iq that's higher than 85 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the population that's a lot higher now,</v>

302
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.560
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't make that much difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of the distribution.</v>

303
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:23.650
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But geniuses don't exist at the middle </v>

304
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.261
<v Speaker 3>of the distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They exist at the tails of the </v>

305
00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:28.991
<v Speaker 3>distribution and you don't need much of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a move at the mean to produce walloping </v>

306
00:16:29.661 --> 00:16:34.661
<v Speaker 3>differences at the tails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the tails are important because a </v>

307
00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:38.051
<v Speaker 3>lot of where we draw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we draw exceptional people from the </v>

308
00:16:38.051 --> 00:16:38.990
<v Speaker 3>exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

309
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:43.991
<v Speaker 3>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's another example of the same </v>

310
00:16:43.991 --> 00:16:44.390
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most engineers are male.</v>

311
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because men are more interested in </v>

312
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.890
<v Speaker 3>things and women are more interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and you might say,</v>

313
00:16:51.891 --> 00:16:53.200
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's socio-cultural.</v>

314
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

315
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:58.220
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know that because if you stack up</v>

316
00:16:58.221 --> 00:17:02.180
<v Speaker 3>countries by their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by their egalitarian social policies,</v>

317
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 3>which you can do quite effectively.</v>

318
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:09.220
<v Speaker 3>And then you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>overrepresentation of men in stem </v>

319
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.031
<v Speaker 3>fields,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the overrepresentation increases as the </v>

320
00:17:13.031 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 3>countries become more egalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not socio-cultural.</v>

321
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.660
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now men aren't that much more interested</v>

322
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:23.150
<v Speaker 3>in things than women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one standard deviation,</v>

323
00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:25.040
<v Speaker 3>which is about the same difference by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>

324
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.590
<v Speaker 3>between the population norm in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ashkenazi Jews.</v>

325
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:32.860
<v Speaker 3>But if you're looking at the person who </v>
<v Speaker 3>the one person in 20 or the one person </v>

326
00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.121
<v Speaker 3>in 50 who's most who's hyper interested </v>
<v Speaker 3>in things and that's likely to become an</v>

327
00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:40.490
<v Speaker 3>engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then most of them are men.</v>

328
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.980
<v Speaker 3>Here's another example of the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

329
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.820
<v Speaker 3>Men are more aggressive than women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you might ask how much and the </v>

330
00:17:49.881 --> 00:17:52.650
<v Speaker 3>answer to that is best place to look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that as in Sweden,</v>

331
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.680
<v Speaker 3>where the egalitarian policies of be </v>
<v Speaker 3>laid out for a long period of time and </v>

332
00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.461
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get a more direct inference </v>

333
00:18:01.461 --> 00:18:01.461
<v Speaker 3>about biology.</v>

334
00:18:01.461 --> 00:18:05.120
<v Speaker 3>If you took a random man and a random </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman out of the population and you had </v>

335
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.681
<v Speaker 3>to bet on who was more aggressive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you bet on the man you'd be right 60 </v>

336
00:18:09.681 --> 00:18:10.890
<v Speaker 3>percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's not that much,</v>

337
00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:11.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

338
00:18:11.351 --> 00:18:14.760
<v Speaker 3>it's deviates from 50 slash 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like 90 slash 10.</v>

339
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.650
<v Speaker 3>It's 60 40.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

340
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.290
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what does that mean?</v>

341
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got a tail problem here.</v>

342
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:26.691
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say that now you decide to go out </v>

343
00:18:26.691 --> 00:18:28.941
<v Speaker 3>onto the extremes of aggression and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>identify the most aggressive one in 100 </v>

344
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:31.800
<v Speaker 3>persons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all men.</v>

345
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.000
<v Speaker 3>Guess who's in prison?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people.</v>

346
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.300
<v Speaker 3>That's why most of the people in prison </v>
<v Speaker 3>are men.</v>

347
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.960
<v Speaker 3>And so this is elementary part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem in our society is that we don't </v>

348
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.191
<v Speaker 3>understand statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't understand that you can have </v>

349
00:18:49.191 --> 00:18:52.551
<v Speaker 3>relatively small differences at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>population level that produce walloping </v>

350
00:18:52.561 --> 00:18:55.230
<v Speaker 3>consequences at the tails of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>distribution.</v>

351
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.600
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So back to ICU.</v>

352
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.840
<v Speaker 3>One final thing to say about Iq.</v>

353
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.380
<v Speaker 3>The ethnic differences are difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dispense with.</v>

354
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.190
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy to make them go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say,</v>

355
00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:14.970
<v Speaker 3>well the tests aren't culture fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well here's the test of that.</v>

356
00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:18.420
<v Speaker 3>So imagine you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you test group a with an Iq test and the</v>

357
00:19:18.421 --> 00:19:23.421
<v Speaker 3>test group B with an Iq test and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at their actual performance in </v>

358
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:28.491
<v Speaker 3>whatever you're predicting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the test was biased against ethnic </v>

359
00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:32.421
<v Speaker 3>group A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it would under predict their </v>

360
00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:34.110
<v Speaker 3>performance and that doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you could say,</v>

361
00:19:34.111 --> 00:19:36.180
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's systemic bias in the performance</v>

362
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:40.050
<v Speaker 3>measures and the potential measures and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a possibility.</v>

363
00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.220
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now one other thing about that.</v>

364
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:50.870
<v Speaker 3>There's a real danger in the ethnicity </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq debate and the danger is that we </v>

365
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:56.660
<v Speaker 3>confuse intelligence with value or that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we include we we confuse intelligence </v>

366
00:19:58.861 --> 00:20:01.860
<v Speaker 3>with yet with human value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a better way of thinking about it</v>

367
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:07.220
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have to understand here is that </v>

368
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:11.361
<v Speaker 3>that's a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that being more intelligent doesn't </v>

369
00:20:11.361 --> 00:20:11.361
<v Speaker 3>make you a better person.</v>

370
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:16.460
<v Speaker 3>That's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you more useful for complex </v>

371
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.960
<v Speaker 3>cognitive operations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can be pretty damn horrific as a</v>

372
00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:21.240
<v Speaker 3>genius son of a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

373
00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:26.241
<v Speaker 3>It's morally neutral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we also know that from the </v>

374
00:20:26.241 --> 00:20:26.241
<v Speaker 3>psychometric data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

375
00:20:26.241 --> 00:20:29.871
<v Speaker 3>there doesn't seem to be any </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship whatsoever between </v>

376
00:20:29.871 --> 00:20:32.121
<v Speaker 3>intelligence and virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so if it does turn out that nature </v>

377
00:20:32.121 --> 00:20:35.820
<v Speaker 3>and the fates do not align with our </v>
<v Speaker 3>egalitarianism presuppositions,</v>

378
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:40.821
<v Speaker 3>which is highly probable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't therefore make the mistake </v>

379
00:20:40.821 --> 00:20:43.881
<v Speaker 3>of assuming that if group A or person a </v>
<v Speaker 3>is lower on one of these attributes than</v>

380
00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:48.210
<v Speaker 3>group B or person b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that is somehow reflective of their</v>

381
00:20:48.211 --> 00:20:51.390
<v Speaker 3>intrinsic value as human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big mistake.</v>
