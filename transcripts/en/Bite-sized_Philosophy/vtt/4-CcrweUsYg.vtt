1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.150
<v Speaker 1>People have a lot of guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:08.151
<v Speaker 1>there there's a line of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology that claims that most people </v>

3
00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>feel that they're better than other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and like I just don't buy that,</v>

4
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:14.961
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what I've seen in my life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm a bit biased because I'm a </v>

5
00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:18.381
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist and I see more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are overtly suffering maybe </v>

6
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>than people do in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm not so sure about that,</v>

7
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:26.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have to scratch very </v>

8
00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:28.221
<v Speaker 1>far beneath the surface of most people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives before you find something truly </v>

9
00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:32.511
<v Speaker 1>tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean this sort of tragedy </v>

10
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:32.511
<v Speaker 1>that you whine about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

11
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:33.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mother has Alzheimer's or,</v>

12
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:38.741
<v Speaker 1>or your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your best friend committed suicide or </v>

13
00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>you have a close relative with cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a sick child or you know,</v>

14
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:44.721
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with you because</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everyone has at least one really </v>

15
00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing wrong with them.</v>

16
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey you will.</v>

17
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

19
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.420
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that depth tragic sense of being is </v>

20
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.230
<v Speaker 1>there with people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the case that,</v>

21
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>that in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I rarely meet someone who says,</v>

22
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing everything I possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hell of a guy and I can't see how </v>

24
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I could possibly improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

25
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 1>you meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you meet someone like that.</v>

26
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>You think they're narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

27
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Would endure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

28
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

29
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>but most people don't feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel like they could do a hell of a</v>

30
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:23.331
<v Speaker 1>lot better than they are and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite acutely aware of their faults and </v>

31
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>they don't feel that they are what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>

32
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>And you see what happens in the story of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam and Eve as well as that.</v>

33
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>When people become self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least that's how it looks to me.</v>

34
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.010
<v Speaker 1>They get thrown out of paradise and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in history.</v>

35
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:40.011
<v Speaker 1>And history is a place where there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain in childbirth and where you're </v>

36
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:42.300
<v Speaker 1>dominated by your mate and where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to toil like mad,</v>

37
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>like no other animal because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of the future.</v>

38
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.060
<v Speaker 1>You have to work and sacrifice the joys </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the present for the future </v>

39
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know you're going to die and you</v>

40
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>have all that weight on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me,</v>

41
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:58.671
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just how can anything be more </v>

42
00:01:58.671 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>true than not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just as far as I can tell.</v>

43
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:04.191
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it is for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're naive beyond </v>

44
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:06.590
<v Speaker 1>comprehension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about your life that,</v>

45
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is echoed in,</v>

46
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:13.431
<v Speaker 1>in that representation and why it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that mean we're such strange creatures </v>

47
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>because we don't seem to really fit into</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in some sense.</v>

48
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's also what's expressed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of the fall.</v>

49
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existentialist said,</v>

50
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:26.391
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people feel like they have a debt that </v>

51
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:26.391
<v Speaker 1>they have to pay off to existence for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

52
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:31.210
<v Speaker 1>for the crime of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the crime of there being something </v>

53
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.031
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's because we're acutely </v>

54
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:37.281
<v Speaker 1>aware that we have to offer something of</v>
<v Speaker 1>value to the people around us so that </v>

55
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:37.520
<v Speaker 1>they can tolerate us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>well we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going about our business.</v>

57
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:44.211
<v Speaker 1>But it seems deeper than that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings seem to exist in a post </v>

58
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:49.911
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly also what's </v>

59
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:52.851
<v Speaker 1>represented in genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very interesting because you </v>

60
00:02:52.851 --> 00:02:52.851
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

61
00:02:52.851 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>in the Adam and Eve story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two,</v>

62
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>there's two catastrophes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially there's the catastrophe that</v>

63
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:02.511
<v Speaker 1>occurs when Adam and eve wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we'll talk about in detail and </v>

64
00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>become self conscious and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and know that they're naked,</v>

65
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>that and their eyes are open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

66
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.720
<v Speaker 1>So that's the terminology that's used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to have your eyes open means to have</v>

67
00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an increment in consciousness.</v>

68
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:17.251
<v Speaker 1>Essentially [inaudible] eyes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with consciousness for human </v>

69
00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>beings because we're intensely visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

70
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.650
<v Speaker 1>And so the metaphor of having your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>opened means it's the same as the </v>

71
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.271
<v Speaker 1>metaphor of coming to consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as Adam and eve come to </v>

72
00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:27.271
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized they're naked.</v>

73
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.370
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the classic interpretation of that is </v>

74
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>that it has something to do with sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>sin.</v>

75
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.890
<v Speaker 1>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that I,</v>

76
00:03:34.891 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that that's what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

77
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>All the other elements about that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are irrelevant,</v>

78
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 1>it's more of that to realize that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>naked.</v>

79
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>if you dream that you're naked on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage in front of people,</v>

81
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.750
<v Speaker 1>that's not a sexual dream man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're some kind of strange </v>

82
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.750
<v Speaker 1>exhibitionist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

83
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you want to cover yourself up and </v>

84
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.561
<v Speaker 1>get the hell off that stage as fast as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible and so it'll be naked in front </v>

85
00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:02.341
<v Speaker 1>of a crowd is to have everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to have the judgment of the social </v>

86
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:07.351
<v Speaker 1>world focused on your self evident </v>
<v Speaker 1>inadequacies and that makes people self </v>

87
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>conscious and that that's a real human </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

88
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>It's associated with neuroticism and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the big five traits model,</v>

89
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:19.621
<v Speaker 1>but people don't like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like having their fragility </v>

90
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:24.241
<v Speaker 1>and vulnerability exposed to the group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the two major fears of </v>

91
00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:28.111
<v Speaker 1>people because one is social humiliation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other is something like </v>

92
00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:32.041
<v Speaker 1>mortality and death and like your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your typical agoraphobic for example,</v>

93
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 1>gets to have both those fears at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time because she usually is.</v>

94
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:40.411
<v Speaker 1>She Ken's to believe she's going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very spectacular and exhibition mystic</v>

95
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:45.721
<v Speaker 1>heart attack in a public place and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a terrible fool of herself while she's </v>

96
00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

97
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.220
<v Speaker 1>and then that's a good example of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two archetipal fears that characterize,</v>

98
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 1>characterize human beings.</v>
