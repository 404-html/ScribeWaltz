1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.380
<v Speaker 1>You know if you listen to a complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of music or at least this is my </v>

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.570
<v Speaker 1>experience with complex music is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the first time I hear it.</v>

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like it and I don't I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I think I also don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually can't hear it.</v>

5
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>You know maybe a musical genius could </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear the whole thing instantly you know </v>

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.670
<v Speaker 1>say Franz Liszt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say he could sight read anything on</v>

7
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:25.671
<v Speaker 1>the piano first try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know some people are so </v>

8
00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:30.171
<v Speaker 1>intelligent musically that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible and I'm sure they hear </v>

9
00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:33.591
<v Speaker 1>things just fine the first time they </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear them but then what happens for me </v>

10
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>is that if I listen to it a couple more </v>
<v Speaker 1>times there are pieces chunks of it that</v>

11
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>start to fall into place that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow.</v>

12
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>And you know I can see the beauty sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of shining through those and then </v>

13
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>eventually the whole thing.</v>

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Leaks together and then I can listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it especially if it's a complete black </v>

15
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>piece of music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many many many times.</v>

16
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>And the more complex and probably the </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.100
<v Speaker 1>The piece of music the more I can listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it but if I listen to it enough at </v>

18
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 1>some point then I've had enough of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all very strange phenomena.</v>

19
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things you might ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself is What exactly are you </v>

20
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.431
<v Speaker 1>learning while you're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're you know it seems like you want </v>

21
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>the music it's something like you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>the music to be.</v>

22
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Just exactly the right amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable and unpredictable and if </v>

23
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.450
<v Speaker 1>it's too unpredictable then you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it and if it's too </v>

24
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.110
<v Speaker 1>predictable it's boring and so it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a conversation not way.</v>

25
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.360
<v Speaker 1>It's actually just like life as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you want things to be </v>

26
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>predictable and stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you want things to be unpredictable </v>

27
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>and interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the degree to which you want each of</v>

28
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>those is going to depend on the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the context.</v>

29
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>And also on your own intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>

30
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

31
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell you a bunch of stories and give you</v>

32
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of a number of pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and.</v>

33
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully they'll click together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I think the reason that this </v>

34
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.641
<v Speaker 1>information is always being transmitted </v>
<v Speaker 1>in story in image form is because it's </v>

35
00:01:58.641 --> 00:02:02.391
<v Speaker 1>very very difficult to transform it into</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated into fully articulated </v>

36
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't really how it works.</v>

37
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>No we're not really accustomed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the idea that there are </v>

38
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.731
<v Speaker 1>certain forms of information that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that are valid forms of </v>

39
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>information that can't be transmitted </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbally.</v>

40
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Of course if you think about it we all </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand this deeply because while I </v>

41
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.171
<v Speaker 1>can give you a bunch of examples the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first example is that when you speak not</v>

42
00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>only do you speak in words and phrases </v>
<v Speaker 1>in sentences and paragraphs but you also</v>

43
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:34.611
<v Speaker 1>speak melodically and in fact part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you can understand </v>

44
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:39.201
<v Speaker 1>melodies and that they make sense to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what artists have done is </v>

45
00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:43.701
<v Speaker 1>separated the melodic element of speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the semantic element and then </v>

46
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:48.921
<v Speaker 1>played with the melodic element and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>melodic element tends to carry a lot of </v>

47
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:50.890
<v Speaker 1>emotion and intent and soul.</v>

48
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>If you're listening to someone speak you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell when they're being ironic you </v>

49
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.730
<v Speaker 1>know because they raised an eyebrow and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their voice changes slightly even though</v>

50
00:02:59.731 --> 00:03:03.360
<v Speaker 1>they might be using in fact they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>using exactly the same words and in fact</v>

51
00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:08.361
<v Speaker 1>someone who's very good at being witty </v>
<v Speaker 1>or ironic will set the situation up so </v>

52
00:03:08.361 --> 00:03:10.440
<v Speaker 1>that you can barely tell that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>joking.</v>

53
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.880
<v Speaker 1>And the better they are at that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time of year that they give you that you</v>

54
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:18.870
<v Speaker 1>can still catch onto the funny or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation is so.</v>

55
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.500
<v Speaker 1>So we know that the information can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitted through non-verbal channels </v>

56
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.611
<v Speaker 1>if it even happens during speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course we understand that </v>

57
00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:35.031
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Presents to us an intimation of meaning </v>

58
00:03:35.031 --> 00:03:40.011
<v Speaker 1>that's very difficult to fully grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And music for me has always been a </v>

59
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.140
<v Speaker 1>ineffable phenomenon in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

60
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.460
<v Speaker 1>It carries the intimation of meaning in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a manner that can't be rationally </v>

61
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.980
<v Speaker 1>dismissed or that people are interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in rationally dismissing.</v>

62
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 1>So even punk rock nihilists listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>punk rock nihilistic music and they know</v>

63
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.740
<v Speaker 1>they find that meaningful even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't believe in meaning.</v>

64
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.820
<v Speaker 1>And you know in some sense they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>victims of their own rationality because</v>

65
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
<v Speaker 1>they do believe in meaning or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be listening to the music but </v>

66
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.630
<v Speaker 1>they can't understand how they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly believe in it so their rational</v>

67
00:04:12.631 --> 00:04:17.631
<v Speaker 1>mind has dispensed with the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that's people dispense </v>

68
00:04:17.631 --> 00:04:21.801
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of meaning for lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons partly because of because it's </v>

69
00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:26.271
<v Speaker 1>inevitable in some sense with sufficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality but also because because </v>

70
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:28.350
<v Speaker 1>it's always useful to look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the.</v>

71
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Underbelly of things because it also </v>
<v Speaker 1>justifies not bearing any responsibility</v>

72
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:38.091
<v Speaker 1>for your life and not fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that can be a very desirable side </v>

73
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:41.850
<v Speaker 1>effect of a particular ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrational belief.</v>

74
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.320
<v Speaker 1>And then there's dance of course and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dance is even more ineffable.</v>

75
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.500
<v Speaker 1>The music although it's often paired </v>
<v Speaker 1>with music you know when it's and it it </v>

76
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.470
<v Speaker 1>grips people if you see a remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 1>dance performance.</v>

77
00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Well part of it is that you're sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrilled and excited about seeing just </v>

78
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.921
<v Speaker 1>exactly what the human form can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because perhaps partly because you're </v>

79
00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:08.391
<v Speaker 1>human and when you see someone extending</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain ability far beyond the norm </v>

80
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.260
<v Speaker 1>then it expands your sense of what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being is capable of.</v>

81
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.290
<v Speaker 1>So there so there's that there's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pure steel element and then there's </v>

82
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.591
<v Speaker 1>the novelty element because often if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch a particularly good dancer there's</v>

83
00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:25.110
<v Speaker 1>things they do that you haven't seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>before that you didn't know anyone could</v>

84
00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:28.200
<v Speaker 1>do and that's pretty fun and then often </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dances.</v>

85
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Is joined with the music and the body is</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing what the music means and even</v>

86
00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:38.781
<v Speaker 1>though you can't tell what the music </v>
<v Speaker 1>means you can tell that that dance is </v>

87
00:05:38.781 --> 00:05:38.781
<v Speaker 1>expressing.</v>

88
00:05:38.781 --> 00:05:43.060
<v Speaker 1>And see I think what happens there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that music represents the patterns of </v>

89
00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:48.351
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually because people think of </v>

90
00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:48.351
<v Speaker 1>music as a Non-representational art but </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's wrong.</v>

91
00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:53.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>representational art is that being is </v>

92
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.691
<v Speaker 1>made up of layers of patterned layers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns constantly interaction </v>

93
00:05:56.691 --> 00:06:00.600
<v Speaker 1>interacting and hopefully in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively harmonious way and music.</v>

94
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Music demonstrates that mimics that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense abstractly and then the dance</v>

95
00:06:06.721 --> 00:06:11.721
<v Speaker 1>is an abstract representation like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people adapt to the patterns of being </v>

96
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 1>and the dancer adapts to the pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 1>music and so it's symbolic it's an </v>

97
00:06:16.351 --> 00:06:21.040
<v Speaker 1>embodied display of the place of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person in the cosmos.</v>

98
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 1>And you can you can also make that case </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see people dancing in pairs </v>

99
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.170
<v Speaker 1>because you can dance alone or you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>dance in pairs and that's basically </v>

100
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.170
<v Speaker 1>standard human adaptation.</v>

101
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.020
<v Speaker 1>And music is interesting too because one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things that you'll notice is that</v>

102
00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:42.021
<v Speaker 1>there's always music in a movie almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>always there's the movie that doesn't </v>

103
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:46.571
<v Speaker 1>have it's quite marked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it's absent you know the movie </v>

104
00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:47.970
<v Speaker 1>feels a lot more cold and clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>although it can work.</v>

105
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.440
<v Speaker 1>But we accept the idea that music can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to fill in the missing context in a</v>

106
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>movie without even ever questioning it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

107
00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Like it's very strange if you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it that you go to a movie that is </v>

108
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.841
<v Speaker 1>doing at least at least part of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>function is to portray reality in a </v>

109
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:09.221
<v Speaker 1>realistic way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a soundtrack playing in the </v>

110
00:07:09.221 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 1>background all the time and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it.</v>

111
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.740
<v Speaker 1>It's so useful and so appropriate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't notice how strange it is that </v>

112
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 1>that's OK.</v>
