1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Earlier when you talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminality and creativity trends in,</v>

2
00:00:03.851 --> 00:00:05.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in men peaking at 14,</v>

3
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.740
<v Speaker 1>it reminded me of something you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Joe Rogan.</v>

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking with sjws and kind of in how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they create their own chaos,</v>

5
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:17.200
<v Speaker 1>talking about how adolescents have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive to change the world.</v>

6
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.960
<v Speaker 1>And I was wondering if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.890
<v Speaker 1>if those three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the criminality,</v>

8
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:24.940
<v Speaker 1>creativity drive to change the world are</v>
<v Speaker 1>linked and if so,</v>

9
00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:29.941
<v Speaker 1>if they manifest differently in men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women and if they couldn't have come </v>

10
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>from the same.</v>

11
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.900
<v Speaker 2>I think they are linked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm going to concentrate more on the</v>

12
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 2>second part of your question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to ask you about something.</v>

13
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 2>So I talked to a friend of mine the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day.</v>

14
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 2>He's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart guy and we've been talking </v>

15
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.481
<v Speaker 2>about all the sorts of things that we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been talking about tonight for a long </v>

16
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were talking about the relatively</v>

17
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 2>the relative evolutionary roles of men </v>
<v Speaker 2>and women.</v>

18
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.680
<v Speaker 2>This is speculative obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And and because our research did </v>

19
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 2>indicate it's tended of research so far </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

20
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

21
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 2>the SGS sjw sort of equality above all </v>
<v Speaker 2>else philosophy is more prevalent among </v>

22
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:11.241
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's predicted by the personality </v>

23
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 2>factors that are more common among </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

24
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 2>so agreeableness and high negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion,</v>

25
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.360
<v Speaker 2>primarily agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in addition it's also predicted by </v>

26
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.961
<v Speaker 2>being female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's interesting because in most </v>

27
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:26.751
<v Speaker 2>of the personality research that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done and as far as I know in the </v>

28
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 2>literature at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 2>in more broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time you can get rid of the </v>

30
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.870
<v Speaker 2>attitudinal differences between men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women or at least reduce them by </v>

31
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.870
<v Speaker 2>controlling for personality.</v>

32
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 2>So if you take a feminine man in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>masculine woman,</v>

33
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.250
<v Speaker 2>then you know the polls reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that didn't seem to be the case with</v>

34
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:48.651
<v Speaker 2>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've been thinking about that a </v>

35
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:48.651
<v Speaker 2>lot because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

36
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:53.421
<v Speaker 2>men are bailing out of the humanities </v>
<v Speaker 2>like mad and pretty much out of the </v>

37
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:56.781
<v Speaker 2>universities except for step,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women are moving in like mad and </v>

38
00:01:56.781 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 2>they're also moving into the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>sphere like Matt and this is new,</v>

39
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:03.921
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've never had this happen before and </v>

40
00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:03.921
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

41
00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:06.291
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do not know what the significance of it </v>

42
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:08.211
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only 50 years old and so we were </v>

43
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:09.540
<v Speaker 2>thinking about this and so I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you think about this proposition,</v>

44
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 2>but imagine that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

45
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.310
<v Speaker 2>that historically speaking at something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like women were responsible for </v>

46
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 2>distribution and men were responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for production,</v>

47
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.190
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe maybe that's only the case </v>

48
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 2>really in the tight confines of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate family,</v>

49
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:31.191
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't matter because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the evolutionary landscape for </v>

50
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:31.191
<v Speaker 2>human beings anyways.</v>

51
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 2>But the women does it did was make sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody got enough.</v>

52
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to me to be one of the </v>

53
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.650
<v Speaker 2>things that's driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>

54
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 2>the sjw demand for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for equity and equality.</v>

55
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's make sure everybody has enough.</v>

56
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

57
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:46.530
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

58
00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

59
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't argue with that,</v>

60
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.930
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an antipathy between that and </v>

61
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 2>the reality of differential productivity</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people really do differ in their</v>

62
00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 2>productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

63
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to answer your question fully,</v>

64
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.650
<v Speaker 2>I do think that the rebellious tendency </v>
<v Speaker 2>of adolescents is associated both with </v>

65
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.091
<v Speaker 2>that criminality spike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially among men and with </v>

66
00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:12.091
<v Speaker 2>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

67
00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:16.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that the sjw phenomena is </v>
<v Speaker 2>different and I think it is associated </v>

68
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.581
<v Speaker 2>at least in part with the rise of women </v>
<v Speaker 2>to political power and and we don't know</v>

69
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:25.651
<v Speaker 2>what women are like when they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>political power because they've never </v>

70
00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 2>had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's been queens obviously and</v>

71
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:32.161
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just being female authority figures and </v>

72
00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:34.291
<v Speaker 2>females have wielded far more power </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically than feminists generally </v>

73
00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:38.041
<v Speaker 2>like to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is a different thing and we </v>

74
00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:40.861
<v Speaker 2>don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what truly female political philosophy </v>

75
00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 2>would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it might be,</v>

76
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's not been well </v>
<v Speaker 2>examined and it isn't very sophisticated</v>

77
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 2>conceptually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could easily be,</v>

78
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 2>but let's make sure things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributed equally well.</v>

79
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:53.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sorry that that's just not gonna </v>

80
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:53.911
<v Speaker 2>fly.</v>

81
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Do you think in terms of the west with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sjws and you talked about last lecture </v>

82
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.980
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating chaos when there is none.</v>

83
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it'd be Sadek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there would be any validity</v>

84
00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:06.420
<v Speaker 1>in saying that in a country like Canada </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're pretty gender equal,</v>

85
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.840
<v Speaker 1>is there any merit to thinking sjws are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to create chaos even when they're</v>

86
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.540
<v Speaker 1>arguably is none on a mass level?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's still problems.</v>

87
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it would be static.</v>

88
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.830
<v Speaker 2>Well it wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just wondering is this,</v>

89
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I read this quote once and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember who,</v>

90
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.340
<v Speaker 2>who said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might've been Robert Heinlein for </v>

91
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.500
<v Speaker 2>crying out loud science fiction author </v>
<v Speaker 2>that springs to mind,</v>

92
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:32.760
<v Speaker 2>but it probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably wasn't.</v>

93
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 2>And the proposition was that man tested </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and women tested men and I kind of</v>

94
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:41.820
<v Speaker 2>liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about that,</v>

95
00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:46.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now it obviously it's an </v>

96
00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:48.261
<v Speaker 2>overgeneralization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also don't know to what degree </v>

97
00:04:48.261 --> 00:04:52.370
<v Speaker 2>women test men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surely through provo provocation it's a </v>

98
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.890
<v Speaker 2>lot because like if you want to test </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

99
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.160
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a little conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Mike,</v>

100
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.730
<v Speaker 2>you poke the hell out of them and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

101
00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:59.250
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm gonna like go after you and see</v>

102
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:02.280
<v Speaker 2>where your weak spots are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me that this.</v>

103
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.580
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that in this constant </v>
<v Speaker 2>protest and use of shame and all of </v>

104
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:09.180
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes along with this,</v>

105
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.630
<v Speaker 2>with this sort of radical movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards egalitarianism,</v>

106
00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:16.950
<v Speaker 2>that there's a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>provocation and go on.</v>

107
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say this too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I shouldn't,</v>

108
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.600
<v Speaker 2>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we met her.</v>

109
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm trying trying to figure it out.</v>

110
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was absolutely comical when</v>

111
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.510
<v Speaker 2>50 shades of gray movie that just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought that was just so insanely</v>

112
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:35.511
<v Speaker 2>comical that at the same time there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>this massive political demand for like </v>

113
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.180
<v Speaker 2>radical equality and and say with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to sexual behavior and the </v>

114
00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:46.551
<v Speaker 2>fastest selling novel the world had ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen was snm domination.</v>

115
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

116
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.970
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we didn't know where the </v>

117
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.970
<v Speaker 2>unconscious is going with that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't leave.</v>

118
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes I think like because one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things that I've really tried to </v>

119
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.600
<v Speaker 2>puzzle out and it's like I believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

120
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm just telling you what I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the edges of my thinking have been</v>

121
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:06.551
<v Speaker 2>going is that you have this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>alliance between the feminists and the </v>

122
00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 2>radical Islamists that I just do not </v>
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>

123
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like the feminist is like why they </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't protesting nonstop about Saudi </v>

124
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Arabia is just completely beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I do not understand it in the </v>

125
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 2>least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wonder too,</v>

126
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I just wonder bloody wellis this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fruit in me is like,</v>

127
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.220
<v Speaker 2>is there an attraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:06:24.221 --> 00:06:29.221
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there an attraction that's emerging </v>

129
00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 2>among the female radicals for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian male dominance that they've</v>

130
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 2>chased out of the West?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that's a hell of the thing to</v>

131
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I am after all,</v>

132
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 2>I am a psychoanalytically minded and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do think things like that because like I</v>

133
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 2>just can see no rational reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only other rational reason is that,</v>

134
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.860
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the West needs to fall and so the enemy </v>

135
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 2>of my enemy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the is exactly.</v>

136
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Now what is it the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got that wrong.</v>

137
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 2>But the enemy of enemy is my friend.</v>

138
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

139
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.720
<v Speaker 2>Elements tend to vote liberal as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

140
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.810
<v Speaker 2>as well so that that could be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I are not going to shake my </v>

141
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.801
<v Speaker 2>suspicion about the this unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>balancing because as the demand for </v>

142
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:13.871
<v Speaker 2>egalitarianism and the eradication of </v>
<v Speaker 2>masculinity accelerates,</v>

143
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.660
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a longing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious for the precise opposite of </v>

144
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

145
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.390
<v Speaker 2>The more you will scream for equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more your unconscious is going to </v>

146
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 2>admire dominance and so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

147
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

148
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.670
<v Speaker 2>that's well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you think.</v>

149
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:33.900
<v Speaker 2>If you're a psychoanalytically minded </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

150
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm a great admirer of Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew a hell of a lot more than people</v>

151
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 2>like to think and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is partly why everyone still hates</v>

152
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:42.420
<v Speaker 2>them even though it's been 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>since he's really,</v>

153
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 2>really been around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

154
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.950
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should stop.</v>
