1
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Heavy emphasis on dealing with future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned that the program effects </v>

2
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.560
<v Speaker 1>are much more pronounced than men </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically on the western to imagery </v>

3
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>and imagery and visual spatial abilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>related.</v>

4
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that men on average have greater </v>

5
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.220
<v Speaker 1>visual visual spatial ability because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this account for the gender difference </v>

6
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>in the program's efficacy.</v>

7
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.120
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're good questions.</v>

8
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a couple of strange things</v>

9
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.190
<v Speaker 2>that it takes that I don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

10
00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:47.191
<v Speaker 2>The first is when we've done the </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis of the effects of the future </v>

11
00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:50.401
<v Speaker 2>authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has had a different differential </v>

12
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:53.320
<v Speaker 2>impact on men and it's had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly differential impact on what</v>

13
00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:58.321
<v Speaker 2>I would call it excluded men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that would be non western ethic </v>

14
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:02.101
<v Speaker 2>minority men or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what majority of men who aren't doing</v>

15
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:04.180
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

16
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:09.181
<v Speaker 2>at Mohawk College,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future authoring program had a </v>

17
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:12.271
<v Speaker 2>particularly robust effect on Mohawk </v>
<v Speaker 2>college students who are men who hadn't </v>

18
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:16.381
<v Speaker 2>done very well in high school and knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't picked a major that had a </v>

19
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 2>destination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a career destination edits.</v>

20
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.570
<v Speaker 2>And so you can imagine those people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have an ambiguous relationship with</v>

21
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.460
<v Speaker 2>the idea of education and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>oriented specifically towards a goal.</v>

22
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 2>They're not very motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now why did it have a differential </v>

23
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.780
<v Speaker 2>effect on men now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

24
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

25
00:01:36.671 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 2>the women are doing better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it might just be a matter of the fact</v>

26
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:42.670
<v Speaker 2>that it does better for people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't doing as well.</v>

27
00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 2>And at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them are men,</v>

28
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that might be part of it,</v>

29
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 2>but I don't believe that's all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that part of the reason that </v>

30
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.530
<v Speaker 2>women are doing better is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're agreeable.</v>

31
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.950
<v Speaker 2>And so if a system sets out a structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>and says,</v>

32
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 2>here's a pathway to attainment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women won't rebel against that.</v>

33
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 2>They'll go along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's working very well for them at</v>

34
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The man,</v>

35
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 2>especially the men on the disagreeable </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the distribution and there's way </v>

36
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.030
<v Speaker 2>more men on the district disagreeable </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the distribution.</v>

37
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Then there are women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

38
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:16.381
<v Speaker 2>That's what you get from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at overlapping normal </v>

39
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 2>distributions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's the male district,</v>

40
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:20.680
<v Speaker 2>female distribution for agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mail distribution for agreeableness.</v>

41
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Tremendous overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:27.931
<v Speaker 2>Women are higher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the really agreeable people are </v>

43
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.331
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the really disagreeable people are </v>

44
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:31.030
<v Speaker 2>meant and maybe the real differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>occur at the extremes,</v>

45
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

46
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.800
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

47
00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a very interesting side effect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>overlapping distributions so that people</v>

48
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:42.031
<v Speaker 2>can be mostly the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that can still produce radical </v>

49
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:45.871
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disagreeable men won't do anything they </v>

50
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:47.470
<v Speaker 2>don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just say up yours,</v>

51
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll go home and play video games with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

52
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm not listening to your stupid classes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why should I work for you?</v>

53
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.520
<v Speaker 2>I'll just go have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do my own thing.</v>

54
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then if you take the men who are </v>

55
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.060
<v Speaker 2>like that and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

56
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 2>what do you want?</v>

57
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 2>You can have what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have figured out what it is.</v>

58
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 2>So then they write down what they want </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they think,</v>

59
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 2>oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that might be worth having.</v>

60
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I'll put some effort into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like to me.</v>

61
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that's weak evidence and this </v>

62
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.751
<v Speaker 2>is a weak argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm trying to stretch out my </v>

63
00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:24.691
<v Speaker 2>understanding to account for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you something else that's </v>

64
00:03:24.691 --> 00:03:24.691
<v Speaker 2>really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand this either.</v>

65
00:03:24.691 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 2>So more than 90 percent of the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who watch my videos on youtube are men.</v>

66
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird because now about 80 </v>

67
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.860
<v Speaker 2>percent of psychology students are </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

68
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 2>so that is not what you would expect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

69
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 2>You would expect that the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them would be women and you might say,</v>

70
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:44.821
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because of the political stance </v>

71
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:44.821
<v Speaker 2>I've taken and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's possible.</v>

72
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 2>So I went and looked at the demographic </v>
<v Speaker 2>data because I have that.</v>

73
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Well before I did any of the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>

74
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 2>85 percent of my viewers were men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's actually increased a bit.</v>

75
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 2>It's increased by six percent and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not trivial,</v>

76
00:03:56.381 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 2>but it was still overwhelmingly men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was interesting.</v>

77
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>

78
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly?</v>

79
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.950
<v Speaker 2>And then now I've been watching crowds </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I've been talking to them and the </v>

80
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 2>crowds that have come to see me in </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

81
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.370
<v Speaker 2>This happened at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto Free Speech Debate and I </v>

82
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.551
<v Speaker 2>actually noticed it and commented on it </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the debate took place because I </v>

83
00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:21.061
<v Speaker 2>was talking about intrinsic differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>between men and women and I looked </v>

84
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:21.061
<v Speaker 2>around the room and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

85
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:25.770
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 percent of the people in this room </v>

86
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.770
<v Speaker 2>are men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had all the men,</v>

87
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 2>women and women stand up and then all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the men stand up.</v>

88
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like here's a natural experiment.</v>

89
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.770
<v Speaker 2>For some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 percent of the people who showed up </v>

90
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.770
<v Speaker 2>to this are men now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody thought I was kinda cracked to</v>

91
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a risk,</v>

92
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:37.110
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

93
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought,</v>

94
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something going on here.</v>

95
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.180
<v Speaker 2>And then what's interesting now is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>every public appearance that I've made </v>

96
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.530
<v Speaker 2>that's related to the sort of topics </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're discussing is overwhelmingly </v>

97
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.530
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

98
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 2>it's like 85 to 90 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought,</v>

99
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>

100
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Like what the Hell's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

101
00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.420
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing I've noticed is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've been talking a lot to the </v>

102
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 2>crowds that I've been talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not about rights,</v>

103
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 2>but about responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

104
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Because he can't have the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>converse.</v>

105
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.290
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't have the conversation about </v>

106
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.571
<v Speaker 2>rights without the conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility because your rights are </v>

107
00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 2>my responsibility.</v>

108
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 2>That's what they are technically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just can't have only half of that</v>

109
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 2>discussion and we're only having half </v>
<v Speaker 2>that discussion.</v>

110
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

111
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:27.061
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are you leaving out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you only have that half of the </v>

112
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 2>discussion and the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

113
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 2>you're leaving out responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then the question is,</v>

114
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you leaving out?</v>

115
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 2>If you're leaving out responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer might be,</v>

116
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 2>well maybe you're leaving out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning of life.</v>

117
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like here you are suffering away.</v>

118
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 2>What makes it worthwhile?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rights.</v>

119
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.680
<v Speaker 2>You know you're completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

120
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.260
<v Speaker 2>you're completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea what you're you.</v>

121
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.080
<v Speaker 2>It's almost impossible to describe how </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad an idea that is.</v>

122
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what gives life meaning.</v>

123
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like lift alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can tolerate yourself,</v>

124
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because look at your useless,</v>

125
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 2>easily hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily killed.</v>

126
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Why should you have any self respect?</v>

127
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 2>That's the story of the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick something up and carry it.</v>

128
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Pick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make it heavy enough so that you can </v>

129
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.260
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

130
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 2>well useless as I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least I could move that from there to</v>

131
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:22.690
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

132
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.700
<v Speaker 2>what's really cool about that is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I talked to these crowds about </v>

133
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.031
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the man's eyes light up and that's very </v>

134
00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:34.180
<v Speaker 2>like I've seen that phenomena because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking about this </v>

135
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 2>mythological material for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can see when I'm watching crowds,</v>

136
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:39.431
<v Speaker 2>people you know their eyebrows lift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their eyes light up because I put </v>

137
00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 2>something together for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not sweat,</v>

138
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:45.671
<v Speaker 2>mythological stories do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not taking responsibility for </v>

139
00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:45.671
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the story's due.</v>

140
00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 2>So I save this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People go click,</v>

141
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click.</v>

142
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.660
<v Speaker 2>You know when their eyes light up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this responsibility thing that's a </v>

143
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.320
<v Speaker 2>whole new order of this is that young </v>
<v Speaker 2>men are so hungry for that.</v>

144
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.320
<v Speaker 2>It is unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I've been talking </v>

145
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.351
<v Speaker 2>to some of the people who've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>running for the conservative leadership </v>

146
00:07:02.351 --> 00:07:06.580
<v Speaker 2>in Canada and I've been talking to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>about if the difficulties they have </v>

147
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.760
<v Speaker 2>communicating with young people because </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives,</v>

148
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:12.761
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are they going to sell to </v>

149
00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:12.761
<v Speaker 2>young people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

150
00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:12.761
<v Speaker 2>Because being conservative is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens when you're older.</v>

151
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 2>They can sell responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's selling it.</v>

152
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is for men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing but responsibility.</v>

153
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.210
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching the simpsons the other </v>

154
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:25.210
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched the first simpsons episode and</v>

155
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.770
<v Speaker 2>I deconstructed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's really interesting.</v>

156
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:32.120
<v Speaker 2>So what happens in the first Simpson </v>
<v Speaker 2>episode is that it's Christmas and homer</v>

157
00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:37.121
<v Speaker 2>and marge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to buy some Christmas </v>

158
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:38.951
<v Speaker 2>presents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but homer doesn't get his Christmas </v>

159
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:40.901
<v Speaker 2>bonus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was absolutely crushed by </v>

160
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:43.751
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that actually is a recurring theme </v>

161
00:07:43.751 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 2>in the simpsons where homer loses his </v>
<v Speaker 2>job or something like that,</v>

162
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 2>or count night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make enough money.</v>

163
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 2>He's completely crushed even though he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of useless,</v>

164
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 2>bumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing,</v>

165
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 2>fool of a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

166
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.980
<v Speaker 2>The thing that gives that show his soul </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that he still oriented towards his </v>

167
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes them vulnerable,</v>

168
00:07:56.991 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 2>is that foolish as he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's decided to adopt responsibility for</v>

169
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 2>his family and to try to bear that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's not.</v>

170
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:09.761
<v Speaker 2>He's a holy fool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a complete fool and so </v>

171
00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:12.641
<v Speaker 2>interesting watching the story because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he suffers dreadfully as a consequence </v>

172
00:08:12.641 --> 00:08:13.700
<v Speaker 2>of not being able to fulfill his </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

173
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for men.</v>

174
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Women have their sets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities.</v>

175
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.240
<v Speaker 2>They're not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

176
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Because then they're complicated because</v>
<v Speaker 2>women of course have to take primary </v>

177
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for for having infants at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least,</v>

178
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 2>but then also for caring for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

179
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.290
<v Speaker 2>They're structured differently than men </v>
<v Speaker 2>per biological necessity,</v>

180
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:38.291
<v Speaker 2>even if it's not a psychological issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also partly a psychological </v>

181
00:08:38.291 --> 00:08:38.291
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

182
00:08:38.291 --> 00:08:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Women know what they have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men have to figure out what they have to</v>

183
00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 2>do and if they have nothing worth living</v>
<v Speaker 2>for them,</v>

184
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:49.631
<v Speaker 2>they stay Peter Pan and why the hell not</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the alternative to valued </v>

185
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.920
<v Speaker 2>responsibility is impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low class pleasure,</v>

186
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 2>and you saw that independent Akio story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

187
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 2>That's pleasure island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

188
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:07.251
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why lift the load if there's nothing in </v>

189
00:09:07.251 --> 00:09:07.251
<v Speaker 2>it for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that we're doing to</v>

190
00:09:07.251 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very bad idea,</v>

191
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.820
<v Speaker 2>and two boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like your pathological and </v>

192
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:13.820
<v Speaker 2>oppressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

193
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.141
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then why the hell am I going to play if </v>

194
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:18.141
<v Speaker 2>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's the situation,</v>

195
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 2>if I get no credit for bearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>

196
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.630
<v Speaker 2>can bloody well be sure I'm not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bear it,</v>

197
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 2>but then you know your life is useless </v>
<v Speaker 2>and meaningless and you have.</v>

198
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.820
<v Speaker 2>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're full of self contempt,</v>

199
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:29.340
<v Speaker 2>denialism and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not good.</v>

200
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:34.430
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why I think that's what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think's going on at a deeper level with </v>

201
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.721
<v Speaker 2>regards to men needing this direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A man has to decide that he's going to </v>

202
00:09:38.721 --> 00:09:40.290
<v Speaker 2>do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has to decide that.</v>

203
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

204
00:09:51.231 --> 00:09:54.200
<v Speaker 2>you know partly what you're trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the future authoring process to say,</v>

205
00:09:54.201 --> 00:09:55.550
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what's your highest value?</v>

206
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the star.</v>

207
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

208
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.280
<v Speaker 2>what are you aiming for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can decide man,</v>

209
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.080
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there some criteria.</v>

210
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.260
<v Speaker 2>It should be good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be good for you in a way that </v>

211
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.100
<v Speaker 2>facilitates your moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it should be good for you in a way</v>

212
00:10:10.101 --> 00:10:12.170
<v Speaker 2>that's also good for the family and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

213
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.380
<v Speaker 2>It should cover the the domain of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's constraints on what you </v>

214
00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:20.310
<v Speaker 2>should regard as a value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you.</v>

215
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.050
<v Speaker 2>But within those constraints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the choice.</v>

216
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.660
<v Speaker 2>You have choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

217
00:10:26.661 --> 00:10:31.661
<v Speaker 2>the thing is is that people will carry a</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy load if they get to pick the god </v>

218
00:10:31.661 --> 00:10:34.370
<v Speaker 2>damn load so and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I won't carry any load.</v>

219
00:10:34.371 --> 00:10:35.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

220
00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:40.001
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you're like the sled dog that </v>

221
00:10:40.001 --> 00:10:40.001
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a sled.</v>

222
00:10:40.001 --> 00:10:40.001
<v Speaker 2>Depaul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just gonna.</v>

223
00:10:40.001 --> 00:10:42.410
<v Speaker 2>You're going to tear a piece is out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own legs because you're bored.</v>

224
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.260
<v Speaker 2>You know you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are pack animals.</v>

225
00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:50.261
<v Speaker 2>They need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to pull against a weight and </v>

226
00:10:50.261 --> 00:10:53.620
<v Speaker 2>and that's not true for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not true particularly say for low </v>

227
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.921
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe they're open and creative </v>

228
00:10:56.921 --> 00:10:56.921
<v Speaker 2>are extroverted and some other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the,</v>

229
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 2>for the typical person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

230
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.850
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll eat themselves,</v>

231
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.030
<v Speaker 2>they'll eat themselves up unless they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a load.</v>

232
00:11:04.031 --> 00:11:07.940
<v Speaker 2>This is why there's such an opiod </v>
<v Speaker 2>epidemic among a dispossessed white,</v>

233
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.210
<v Speaker 2>middle aged guys who were unemployed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the US.</v>

234
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like they lose their job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're done right?</v>

235
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:19.180
<v Speaker 2>They despise themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They develop chronic pain syndromes and </v>

236
00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.540
<v Speaker 2>depression and the chronic pain is </v>
<v Speaker 2>treated with opiates.</v>

237
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

238
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.200
<v Speaker 2>that's what it looks like to me is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to.</v>

239
00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:32.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's so interesting to watch the </v>
<v Speaker 2>young man when you talk to them about </v>

240
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:32.260
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a God damn thrilled about it.</v>

241
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.980
<v Speaker 2>It just blows me away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

242
00:11:33.981 --> 00:11:35.840
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's.</v>

243
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:41.230
<v Speaker 2>That's the counterculture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grow the hell up and do something </v>

244
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.840
<v Speaker 2>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

245
00:11:41.841 --> 00:11:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

246
00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:46.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm so excited by that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one ever mentioned that before.</v>

247
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:47.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>

248
00:11:47.601 --> 00:11:48.470
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>

249
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.790
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

250
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.530
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's appalling.</v>

251
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.460
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

252
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.520
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I feel that that's deeply felt by </v>

253
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:57.520
<v Speaker 2>the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are coming out to,</v>

254
00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 2>to listen to these sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to there.</v>

255
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.740
<v Speaker 2>They've had enough of that so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they better have because it's a non </v>

256
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 2>productive mode of being responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

257
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:12.510
<v Speaker 2>That's where the meaning in life is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all right,</v>

258
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.860
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One more class.</v>

259
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see you next week.</v>
