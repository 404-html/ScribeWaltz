1
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.080
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine the flood</v>

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>and then you can set yourself straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can prepare for it and that</v>

3
00:00:10.181 --> 00:00:14.290
<v Speaker 1>means maybe you can stave it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also means that maybe even if you</v>

4
00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:19.291
<v Speaker 1>don't stave it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could ride it out and that's </v>

5
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:22.870
<v Speaker 1>actually the story of Noah because what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens with Noah is that he can see </v>

6
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.541
<v Speaker 1>that things are not good and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a flood coming and God is maybe </v>

7
00:00:29.141 --> 00:00:32.830
<v Speaker 1>letting him know and it says in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story that Noah walked with God,</v>

8
00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:37.831
<v Speaker 1>remembering that's what Adam did before </v>
<v Speaker 1>he got all self conscious about the </v>

9
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:37.831
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He walked with God.</v>

10
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about that more next time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what that would mean maybe is </v>

11
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.241
<v Speaker 1>because Noah was straight and he put </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself together and his familial </v>

12
00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:50.551
<v Speaker 1>relationships were good because it also </v>
<v Speaker 1>says that it his antenna were working </v>

13
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:54.160
<v Speaker 1>and he could see a little farther into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future than someone whose vision was</v>

14
00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:57.430
<v Speaker 1>completely obscured by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by fog and chaos.</v>

15
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.350
<v Speaker 1>And he could tell that things were not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go well.</v>

16
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>And so he prepared for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because he prepared for it.</v>

17
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Well then things are actually went </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty well for Noah even though the </v>

18
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>flood came and so that's an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because that's an.</v>

19
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>That's an indeterminant issue in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

20
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>How big a hurricane would it take to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wipe out New Orleans if everyone was </v>

21
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>heard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to wipe out the Dutch.</v>

23
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's going to be a tough one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

24
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:32.511
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to conjure up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn big storm to take out their </v>

25
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 1>dykes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

26
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>how thoroughly defendant New Orleans be </v>
<v Speaker 1>if nobody in the municipal municipal and</v>

27
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 1>state governments was corrupt.</v>

28
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the hurricane problem because </v>

29
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>that's something that we could clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with.</v>

30
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.531
<v Speaker 1>We know how to do it and the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>applies in your own life is that there </v>

31
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>are floods come and you can bloody well </v>
<v Speaker 1>be sure of that.</v>

32
00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely 100 percent certain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are going to be personal,</v>

33
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:02.541
<v Speaker 1>some of them are going to be familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are going to be social and </v>

34
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>political and economic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

35
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 1>are they going to be catastrophes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you or are you going to ride them out?</v>

36
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to prepare or the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue might be,</v>

37
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:15.141
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have your act together well </v>

38
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:15.141
<v Speaker 1>enough to see them coming</v>

39
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:18.890
<v Speaker 1>with enough advance warning so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take proper measures maybe just to </v>

40
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.341
<v Speaker 1>sidestep it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe just don't go where the flood is </v>

41
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:22.341
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a simple thing,</v>

42
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you don't have that luxury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

43
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>and so it is going to be a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someone in your family is going to</v>

44
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>get really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really sick,</v>

45
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.260
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe maybe there's just a tiny </v>

46
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>pathway through that that everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't fall apart.</v>

47
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't end in divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't end in death.</v>

48
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't end in sorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't end in catastrophe,</v>

49
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:47.901
<v Speaker 1>but the margin of errors like slimmed </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to virtually zero and every </v>

50
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:52.971
<v Speaker 1>imperfection that you bring to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation is going to increase the </v>

51
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:55.791
<v Speaker 1>probability that that tragedy is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to turn it into something </v>

52
00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's coming.</v>

53
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.340
<v Speaker 1>It's coming your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely,</v>

54
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>and so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:06.781
<v Speaker 1>since it's coming your way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the best thing to do is to put </v>

56
00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:09.781
<v Speaker 1>yourself together so that when it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be the least amount of awful </v>

57
00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll close with this story.</v>

58
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.850
<v Speaker 1>This was a very affecting story for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother in law had frontal temporal </v>

59
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>dementia and she developed it quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

60
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>She was about 55,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

61
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>and her husband who is very extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man about town guy,</v>

62
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a small town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew him.</v>

63
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>He was charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drank too much charismatic,</v>

64
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>good businessmen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite a remarkable person,</v>

65
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>a real character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not exactly a family man.</v>

66
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Even though he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

67
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>he provided for his family very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when his wife got sick,</v>

68
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.550
<v Speaker 1>he really took care of her man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something to see because that's </v>

69
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dealing with someone who has Alzheimer's</v>

70
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:03.331
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they get taken away from you </v>

71
00:04:03.331 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>piece by piece and that is not pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's also hard,</v>

72
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only is it catastrophic,</v>

73
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Jesus,</v>

74
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:15.001
<v Speaker 1>he just stepped into that like perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was way less awful than it could </v>

75
00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>have been way.</v>

76
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 1>It was just a tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't hell,</v>

77
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.170
<v Speaker 1>and then I was there when she died and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife's family are actually pretty </v>

78
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 1>good at dealing with death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out.</v>

79
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.680
<v Speaker 1>My wife's sister is a palliative care </v>
<v Speaker 1>nurse and you have to be pretty tough </v>

80
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>cookie to be a palliative care nurse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can do it,</v>

81
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty interesting because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means that you can go make relationships</v>

82
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:47.851
<v Speaker 1>with people at the last stages of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life that are genuine relationships and </v>

83
00:04:47.851 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 1>people just die on you nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>

84
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.560
<v Speaker 1>you know she's a competent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>

85
00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun person.</v>

86
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like two thumbs up for her man that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone you can rely on in a tragedy and</v>

87
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:09.241
<v Speaker 1>her other sister is a pharmacist and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife has volunteered in palliative care </v>

88
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:15.691
<v Speaker 1>wards and is also very good at taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>care of people who are genuinely not in </v>

89
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>good health.</v>

90
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.090
<v Speaker 1>And so we were there when my mother in </v>
<v Speaker 1>law died and course you can imagine.</v>

91
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a deathbed situation for you.</v>

92
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Your mother in law is dying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's at each other's throats,</v>

93
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.880
<v Speaker 1>so like you think that's uncommon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then your eyes aren't open because it's </v>

94
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>plenty bloody comment and then it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a tragedy.</v>

95
00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>It's hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like maybe you can stand the tragedy</v>

96
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:45.391
<v Speaker 1>but you can't stand the hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in this situation that isn't what </v>

97
00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:49.750
<v Speaker 1>happened is everybody pulled together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what happened was while she died,</v>

98
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.290
<v Speaker 1>but what was so interesting was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>family actually came together more </v>

99
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.131
<v Speaker 1>tightly as a consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So although there was something taken </v>

100
00:05:59.131 --> 00:05:59.131
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>

101
00:05:59.131 --> 00:06:03.910
<v Speaker 1>there was something gained on the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't trivial and I'm not trying </v>

102
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.091
<v Speaker 1>to be optimistic and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the universe a wonderful place </v>

103
00:06:07.091 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 1>about all this?</v>

104
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Like someone died in an ugly way and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was harsh,</v>

105
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.810
<v Speaker 1>but God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a hell of a lot better than it </v>

106
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.810
<v Speaker 1>could have been and maybe it was good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

107
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.070
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that this is something that I </v>

108
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.561
<v Speaker 1>constantly wonder is that if people did </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they could to speak the truth and </v>

109
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:30.641
<v Speaker 1>pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe the tragedy that's part of </v>

110
00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:35.201
<v Speaker 1>life wouldn't have to deteriorate into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unbearable hell that doesn't have to</v>

111
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:40.901
<v Speaker 1>be part of life and maybe we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually tolerate the tragedy or maybe </v>

112
00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>we could even rise above it and maybe we</v>
<v Speaker 1>could even mitigate it,</v>

113
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we can.</v>

114
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 1>We do that sort of thing all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's always an open question.</v>

115
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.160
<v Speaker 1>When the Eliana and put it very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the floods the consequence of the </v>

116
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:58.691
<v Speaker 1>fact that things fall apart or are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>floods of consequence of the fact that </v>

117
00:06:58.691 --> 00:07:03.640
<v Speaker 1>people make mistakes that they know they</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't make and make anyways they </v>

118
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:05.780
<v Speaker 1>sin?</v>

119
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's to miss the mark,</v>

120
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:12.401
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's an archery term to send </v>

121
00:07:12.401 --> 00:07:12.401
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means maybe they don't even specify</v>

122
00:07:12.401 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 1>the damn target,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really,</v>

123
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to hit it unless you </v>
<v Speaker 1>specified or having specified it.</v>

124
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>They just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

125
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 1>to hell with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that important.</v>

126
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like you gotta be careful when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say something like to hell with it.</v>

127
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not that important because one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that might happen to you if </v>

128
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.751
<v Speaker 1>you say to hell with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that important is that you </v>

129
00:07:34.751 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 1>might actually end up in hell for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty prolonged period of time or maybe</v>

130
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:42.821
<v Speaker 1>for the remainder of your miserable </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence because it's certainly the </v>

131
00:07:42.821 --> 00:07:47.321
<v Speaker 1>case that people do exist there and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen them exists there and once you're </v>

132
00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no trick.</v>

133
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.050
<v Speaker 1>It's no simple matter to get the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and so it might matter that the </v>

134
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.920
<v Speaker 1>things that matter get addressed.</v>

135
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 1>It might matter that you do what you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>to walk with God.</v>

136
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk more about that next time and</v>

137
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:06.911
<v Speaker 1>it might be that that is how you build </v>
<v Speaker 1>an ark in are protected from the flood </v>

138
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:11.390
<v Speaker 1>even if the damn thing comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is it will,</v>

139
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.990
<v Speaker 1>and this is a funny thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've noticed about our education </v>

140
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.771
<v Speaker 1>system and the way we teach students and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their trigger warnings and all of that </v>

141
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.990
<v Speaker 1>absolute rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in most of my lectures I'd have </v>

142
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.840
<v Speaker 1>to have a trigger warning every 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

143
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.040
<v Speaker 1>So as I tell my students when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

144
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:31.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

145
00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:36.671
<v Speaker 1>don't fool yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to develop a </v>

146
00:08:36.671 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 1>serious illness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least one,</v>

147
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe two or three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of them is likely to be chronic </v>

148
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.180
<v Speaker 1>and if it isn't you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be someone you love.</v>

149
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be your husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be your parent,</v>

150
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:51.371
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be your kids that's coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so as a lot of death and pain and so</v>

151
00:08:52.971 --> 00:08:57.971
<v Speaker 1>like just exactly what sort of person </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to be when that shows up </v>

152
00:08:57.971 --> 00:09:02.300
<v Speaker 1>and that's the right question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't how are you going to be happy </v>

153
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 1>in your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

154
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid ambition anyways,</v>

155
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned because it's too</v>
<v Speaker 1>shallow,</v>

156
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

157
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 1>You're lucky that comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

158
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.720
<v Speaker 1>comes and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the sun coming out from behind the </v>

159
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:14.720
<v Speaker 1>cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're happy,</v>

160
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more power to you,</v>

161
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it.</v>

162
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a gift from the cosmos to be happy,</v>

163
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.140
<v Speaker 1>but at pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

164
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pursuit is when the dam flood comes,</v>

165
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:31.430
<v Speaker 1>you want to be the person who built arc </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the story of Noah is </v>

166
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 1>about and the thing is the flood is </v>
<v Speaker 1>always coming.</v>

167
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that's worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>commenting on with regards to this story</v>

168
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:42.741
<v Speaker 1>is you know there's an apocalyptic </v>
<v Speaker 1>element to the Judeo Christian </v>

169
00:09:42.741 --> 00:09:42.741
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>

170
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:49.370
<v Speaker 1>There's an idea that the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is always at hand and that you </v>

171
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:54.831
<v Speaker 1>should prepare to be judged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about that is it's true </v>

172
00:09:54.831 --> 00:09:58.940
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that's true is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of your world is at hand and it </v>

173
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:04.821
<v Speaker 1>will certainly come and when it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be judged because it will be up</v>

174
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:09.240
<v Speaker 1>to you to figure out what to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that your world just collapsed.</v>

175
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 1>And that'll be a moral problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate severity because it'll push you</v>

176
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:19.461
<v Speaker 1>right to your limits and you'll find out</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly where your unaddressed </v>

177
00:10:19.461 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses lie because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in a crisis.</v>

178
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:28.130
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason that that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal reality and it lurks </v>

179
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.770
<v Speaker 1>underneath the entire Judaeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

180
00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:30.720
<v Speaker 1>the apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the impending apocalypse,</v>

181
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:35.721
<v Speaker 1>is because we always live in apocalyptic</v>
<v Speaker 1>times and your world is always in small </v>

182
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 1>ways and large ways coming to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what do you do?</v>

183
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:45.270
<v Speaker 1>You prepare for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you prepare for your world to come to an</v>

184
00:10:45.271 --> 00:10:47.670
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe when the end comes,</v>

185
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:50.160
<v Speaker 1>you get another world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a good deal.</v>
