1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.860
<v Speaker 1>You remember in the Lion King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may not remember when,</v>

2
00:00:03.861 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Mufasa,</v>

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>that's the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Goes and takes Simba up to show him his </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

5
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>He says he is the King of everything the</v>
<v Speaker 1>light touches.</v>

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very old idea and you guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>had no problem with,</v>

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was fine,</v>

8
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 1>that made sense and that I will be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the light was the darkness.</v>

9
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>And that was the elephant graveyard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was death.</v>

10
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>That was the place of death and danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the hyenas hung out and you</v>

11
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>weren't supposed to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so of course,</v>

12
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Simba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's a rule breaking hero,</v>

13
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>just like Harry Potter immediately goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

14
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the forbidden fruit.</v>

15
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>It's the same sort of idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want someone to do something,</v>

16
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>the best thing to do is tell them that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't and not explain why,</v>

17
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

18
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.760
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I said to you at the beginning of </v>

19
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.760
<v Speaker 1>this class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

20
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.021
<v Speaker 1>I've got one rule here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't sit in that chair no matter what </v>

21
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 1>you'd be thinking the whole year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if I reminded you just what's</v>

22
00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>up with that chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's chairs magical.</v>

23
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you might even,</v>

24
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>while you probably wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is a ridiculous example,</v>

25
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.660
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come to class early and sit in that </v>

26
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>chair just to see what would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>and people are very curious and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what we're like.</v>

28
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very old story too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:25.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like opening Pandora's box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't open that box.</v>

30
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>You'll be sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

31
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>all of the horrors of the world fly out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>

33
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>you will open Pandora's box many times </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life because you know,</v>

34
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.790
<v Speaker 1>with your family or maybe your mate or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe your children,</v>

35
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.270
<v Speaker 1>you'll have this idea that they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>box with things in it that you want to </v>

36
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>know about.</v>

37
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>And you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of curious about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular event,</v>

39
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>so why don't you tell me about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

40
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:58.821
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we probably really shouldn't open that </v>

41
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:01.341
<v Speaker 1>box and you keep bugging him and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they open it and then all sorts of </v>

42
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>things fly out that you didn't expect </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe you think,</v>

43
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.450
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been better if I would </v>

44
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.450
<v Speaker 1>have just left that damn box closed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

45
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 1>and you can do the same thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

46
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Pandora's box idea,</v>

47
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>the forbidden fruit idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

48
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a major league idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason in the Judeo </v>

49
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Christian tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why people are saddled with the notion </v>

50
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.841
<v Speaker 1>of original sin is because hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortically developed chimpanzees without</v>

51
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't keep their hands off things.</v>

52
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.650
<v Speaker 1>And so they keep exploring even when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know better and every time they do </v>

53
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:41.010
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they learned something that is,</v>

54
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>that destroys the paradise that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently inhabit.</v>

55
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's plenty.</v>

56
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.560
<v Speaker 1>You and I never learned anything in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life that's of importance without it </v>

57
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.420
<v Speaker 1>having a pretty damn destabilizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on you at the moment of </v>

58
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.420
<v Speaker 1>realization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>You learn something happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like whatever.</v>

60
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>You know that all that means is that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing things right,</v>

61
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>like it's nice and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not informative.</v>

62
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 1>You do something and all hell breaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>loose.</v>

63
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>That'll make you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's for sure.</v>

64
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>You might never stop thinking for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of your life.</v>
