WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.060
<v Speaker 1>And then in the next scene you see this </v>
<v Speaker 1>model home up for destruction.</v>

2
00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:06.520
<v Speaker 1>It's quite an interesting scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Symbolically.</v>

3
00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:06.850
<v Speaker 1>See</v>

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of this house here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a stain glass window that has a </v>

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Mandela on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll we'll see it more clearly in a </v>

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.680
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And amended.</v>

7
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Mandela is a sacred symbol of the self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

8
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>that's the union interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol.</v>

9
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to describe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a symbol.</v>

10
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Music is a Mandela except it's played </v>
<v Speaker 1>out across time.</v>

11
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>So you could say that that thing is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same as music,</v>

12
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's Kinda like a slice of music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

13
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same idea.</v>

14
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:40.551
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you see those slow motion or </v>

15
00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>sped up motion videos of a flower </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfolding that's the same.</v>

16
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>It's the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine that being set to music </v>

17
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.051
<v Speaker 1>and somehow that would make sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandela is like a symbol of the </v>

18
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:54.411
<v Speaker 1>unfolding of being and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the source of meaning or something </v>

19
00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also a symbol of the self.</v>

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm from the union perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there you see it more clearly.</v>

21
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Kids are starting to burn this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

22
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>and trash it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're dragging the grand piano </v>

23
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>down the down the stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 1>the destruction of high culture about </v>
<v Speaker 1>which they're nothing but cynical </v>

25
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 1>because they don't believe that hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and sacrifice can,</v>

26
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 1>can produce something of any value and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to bring it down and destroy </v>

27
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because</v>

28
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.060
<v Speaker 1>can see this in the story of Cain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abel.</v>

29
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Table is hard working and everyone likes</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and he makes the proper sacrifices.</v>

30
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:36.341
<v Speaker 1>And so his life goes really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the reason that cain </v>

31
00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:37.460
<v Speaker 1>hates him and he's jealous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful.</v>

32
00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:39.770
<v Speaker 1>But worse than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're around someone,</v>

33
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.010
<v Speaker 1>if you're not doing very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if that's your own fault.</v>

34
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.730
<v Speaker 1>If you're not doing very well and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>around someone who's doing very well,</v>

35
00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:51.380
<v Speaker 1>it's very painful because the mere fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>of there being judges you.</v>

36
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very easy to want to destroy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

37
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>to destroy that ideal so that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to live with the terrible </v>

38
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 1>consequences of seeing it embodied in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you.</v>

39
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.920
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reason that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to tear things down is so that they</v>

40
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:10.370
<v Speaker 1>don't have anything to contrast </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves against and to feel bad.</v>

41
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:11.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

42
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>The kids are destroying all of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

43
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking because it judges them </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it exists,</v>

44
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>judges them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've often thought this about </v>

45
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo Statue of David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this heroic.</v>

46
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Speaker 1>So David was a shepherd obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't sound like much,</v>

47
00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:37.321
<v Speaker 1>but back in those times being a shepherd</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a big deal because there were lions </v>

48
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:40.750
<v Speaker 1>and you had a slingshot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like you got to defend your sheep</v>

49
00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:43.960
<v Speaker 1>from lions with a slingshot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you weren't exactly this,</v>

50
00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:48.430
<v Speaker 1>like 19th century English guy dressed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fairly blue suit.</v>

51
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.200
<v Speaker 1>You were tough as a bloody.</v>

52
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's someone who would go after lion </v>

53
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>with a slingshot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke.</v>

54
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the statue is very heroic and you know,</v>

55
00:02:57.731 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 1>you look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

56
00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the possibility of,</v>

57
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>of human kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

58
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>it's also what you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as well as being an ideal,</v>

59
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every ideal is a judge,</v>

60
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>so yes.</v>

61
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

62
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.640
<v Speaker 2>you're using that as an example to </v>
<v Speaker 2>illustrate the coming fitter as a result</v>

63
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.460
<v Speaker 2>of not being</v>

64
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.520
<v Speaker 1>able to achieve a status as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a result of hard work.</v>

65
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.540
<v Speaker 1>But in the example of Canaan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>April.</v>

66
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like one was a shepherd and the </v>

67
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.060
<v Speaker 1>other was a farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the one who knows no one is.</v>

68
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

69
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.510
<v Speaker 1>What was the shepherd was the one who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was favorite?</v>

70
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

71
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Was that a result of the hard work or </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that a result of good question?</v>

72
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.630
<v Speaker 1>The stories as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

73
00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:55.631
<v Speaker 1>Those stories are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated and the story is very </v>

74
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:58.430
<v Speaker 1>ambivalent about whether Kane is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewarded because he makes bad sacrifices</v>

75
00:03:58.431 --> 00:04:02.070
<v Speaker 1>or because God's just in a bad mood and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I like that.</v>

76
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.500
<v Speaker 1>If you read the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read multiple translations of the </v>

77
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>story and when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when caden comes to God,</v>

78
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.080
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God basically tells him,</v>

79
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy,</v>

80
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>before you go about criticizing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of reality,</v>

81
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 1>you should look to your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>inadequacies.</v>

82
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sin Crouches at your door like a </v>

83
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.641
<v Speaker 1>predatory sexually aroused animal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you invited it in to have its way with </v>

84
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 1>you and something has emerged as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence.</v>

85
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>So p bothered me about my creation </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you look to yourself,</v>

86
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.670
<v Speaker 1>so there's a very strong hint that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason that God has not favor cane </v>

87
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices because they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly good quality,</v>

88
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.850
<v Speaker 1>so but the but it is ambivalent in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story and there is the shepherd versus </v>

89
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.900
<v Speaker 1>farmer Motif as well and of course that </v>
<v Speaker 1>motif runs through the whole entire </v>

90
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 1>corpus of stories to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the shepherd motif.</v>

91
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's only about a paragraph long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole story and it packs all that </v>

92
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.571
<v Speaker 1>into that tiny little amount of space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that cain kills able to get</v>

93
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>rid of is ideal and also to punish God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking.</v>

94
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these guys who go around shooting</v>

95
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>up high schools are shooting up high </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools in particular,</v>

96
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:21.331
<v Speaker 1>but you know there are definitely out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for revenge and what their revenging </v>

97
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>themselves against or to who is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly clear.</v>

98
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these kids are just tearing down this</v>

99
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 1>model home carrying down Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

100
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it's another way of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just tearing down civilization period</v>

101
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.650
<v Speaker 1>and Pinocchio's having a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

102
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>He's got his ax and he's looking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little malevolent there and,</v>

103
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 1>and happy to be destroying things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course a pretty simple thing</v>

104
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:48.391
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that image that I told you </v>

105
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:48.780
<v Speaker 1>about the Mandela that's a flower in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this image.</v>

106
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.320
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

107
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's lamp wick throws a brick </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

108
00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.030
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is this the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a symbol of your potential among very</v>

109
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:05.741
<v Speaker 1>many other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by engaging in this sort of </v>

110
00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive activity,</v>

111
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 1>lamp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wick and Pinocchio,</v>

112
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>or making it impossible for them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>further their development.</v>

113
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>And they're doing that to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously,</v>

114
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:17.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they basically say to hell with it and </v>

115
00:06:17.891 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 1>toss a brick through this highest ideal,</v>
