1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you differentiate the utility of </v>

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.540
<v Speaker 1>behavioral slash psychotherapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatments for conditions like </v>

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>depression versus medical treatments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:14.541
<v Speaker 1>so the first thing I would say is don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>underestimate the utility of medical </v>

5
00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>interventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depression is a catastrophe.</v>

6
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:22.461
<v Speaker 1>It carries with it a very high suicide </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate and it also levels people out and </v>

7
00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:27.381
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard on their families and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so and it and it's physiologically </v>

8
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:31.791
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily damaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're in a depressive state </v>

9
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>and it's severe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can try an antidepressant.</v>

10
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>You'll know in a month if it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it works well,</v>

11
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe it'll help you get your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

12
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Like we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you're depressed because your</v>

13
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>life isn't very well together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be.</v>

14
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people are depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life is just,</v>

15
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>it isn't fine because no one's life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

16
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:54.261
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's life is a tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes people have their lives in</v>

17
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:59.271
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as you could expect anyone to </v>

18
00:00:59.271 --> 00:00:59.271
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

19
00:00:59.271 --> 00:00:59.271
<v Speaker 1>They have friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have an intimate relationship,</v>

20
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>they have a career that they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.080
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're qualified industrious people </v>

22
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.080
<v Speaker 1>working hard on what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

23
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.050
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really playing a minimum number of </v>

24
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 1>games with themselves and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly depressed,</v>

25
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant man that sometimes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will just fix it.</v>

26
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And so hooray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were biological entity.</v>

27
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:23.091
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's something out there that can </v>

28
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>help you strengthen yourself so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can prevail.</v>

29
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

30
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear,</v>

31
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>everyone takes antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.890
<v Speaker 1>everyone's taking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no one takes those bloody </v>

33
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.111
<v Speaker 1>things without serious consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half the time I spend with my clients </v>

34
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:40.431
<v Speaker 1>who are depressed is often the two years</v>
<v Speaker 1>long attempt to get them to tentatively </v>

35
00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:45.111
<v Speaker 1>try an antidepressant because there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so guilty that they're relying on an </v>

36
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>external crutch to sort out their lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can't even tolerate it.</v>

37
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

38
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>well look man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you had diabetes,</v>

39
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 1>you know are going to take your insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you got stressed,</v>

40
00:01:55.711 --> 00:02:00.711
<v Speaker 1>you blew out at your weakest point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when you get </v>

41
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:03.231
<v Speaker 1>stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's something out there that </v>

42
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:03.231
<v Speaker 1>might help you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like try it for God's sake.</v>

43
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>You'll know in a month and you'd just </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop if it doesn't work.</v>

44
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>

45
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>you want to do a multidimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

46
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

47
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>do you have any friends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have an intimate relationship?</v>

48
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Are you pursuing one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a reasonable career?</v>

49
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Are you as educated as you are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intelligent?</v>

50
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>You have something useful to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your time outside of work?</v>

51
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a drug or alcohol problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there other behavioral issues like </v>

52
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.670
<v Speaker 1>sleep dysregulation and lack of eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are contributing to the pathology?</v>

53
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.880
<v Speaker 1>You want to differentiate all of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wherever you can make a behavioral </v>

54
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.360
<v Speaker 1>intervention so much the better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes too,</v>

55
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:41.361
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with people whose lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>are so that they don't even know where </v>

56
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:41.361
<v Speaker 1>to start.</v>

57
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>They're different than the ones who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in order.</v>

58
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>

59
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try this man.</v>

60
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you won't cut your throat in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next month because if your dad,</v>

61
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:50.400
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be hard to work with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

62
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 1>so medical interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

63
00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.140
<v Speaker 1>If you're sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do what's necessary to get better </v>

64
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>and you your pride behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

65
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.700
<v Speaker 1>If you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that says nothing about the utility </v>

66
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.141
<v Speaker 1>of the behavioral interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to hit the problem with </v>

67
00:03:10.141 --> 00:03:12.961
<v Speaker 1>everything you have at your disposal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some antidepressants especially,</v>

68
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>especially for people whose lives are </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and who are depressed,</v>

69
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants can be absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>miraculous.</v>

70
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.350
<v Speaker 1>So you know when you hear about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical evidence in their favor being </v>

71
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.090
<v Speaker 1>iffy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly because the diagnosis </v>

72
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.090
<v Speaker 1>of depression isn't very well </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated,</v>

73
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>that it's very different to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible life than to be depressed and </v>

74
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants can only help you so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much if you have a terrible life.</v>

75
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
