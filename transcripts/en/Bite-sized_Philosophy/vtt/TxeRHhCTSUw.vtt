1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>And the midianites sold Joseph into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt,</v>

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:08.811
<v Speaker 1>unto Potiphar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an officer of Pharaohs and captain of </v>

3
00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:08.811
<v Speaker 1>the guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt and</v>

4
00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Potiphar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an officer of Pharaoh,</v>

5
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>captain of the guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Egyptian bought him of the hands</v>

6
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>of the Ishmaelites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had brought him down thither.</v>

7
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>So now he's a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you'd think,</v>

8
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>well that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a man who has a lot of reason to</v>

9
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>be irritated at the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

10
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:32.181
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gone from being the favorite to </v>

11
00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>being betrayed by all of his brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty rough.</v>

12
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.240
<v Speaker 1>And then he's being transformed into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slave and now he's being.</v>

13
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.360
<v Speaker 1>He's being sold to work as a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd think that that would corrupt </v>

14
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>his character because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things,</v>

15
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the case anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are always looking for an</v>

16
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>excuse to have their character </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupted.</v>

17
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Because if your character is corrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get to lie and you get to cheat</v>

18
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>and you get to steal and you get to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade.</v>

19
00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>You get to act resentfully and you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do nothing.</v>

20
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's all easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to lie than to tell the </v>

21
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.101
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to do nothing than to do </v>

22
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:04.101
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's always part of you thinking,</v>

23
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a justification for being useless</v>

24
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>and horrible because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a lot less work.</v>

25
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>And so then if something terrible comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>

26
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>you think a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just exactly the excuse that I </v>

27
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.580
<v Speaker 1>was waiting for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then out all that comes,</v>

28
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers should Ipsen when he was in the</v>

29
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps in Russia watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>how people behaved,</v>

30
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that there were people that were</v>

31
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:34.821
<v Speaker 1>put into camps who immediately became </v>
<v Speaker 1>trustees are guards and they were even </v>

32
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>more vicious than the people who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been hired as guards.</v>

33
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>And his idea was that they had collected</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

34
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>He called it fallenness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly around them in </v>

35
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:50.901
<v Speaker 1>normal life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't have the opportunity to </v>

36
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:53.991
<v Speaker 1>express it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as you gave them the </v>

37
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:53.991
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like there,</v>

38
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:53.991
<v Speaker 1>it was right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

39
00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.340
<v Speaker 1>so one of the messages that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>echo through these old testament stories</v>

40
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>is that just because something terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to you doesn't mean that you get</v>

41
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:10.581
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you get to wander off the path and </v>

42
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>make things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it doesn't matter how terrible</v>

43
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>it is that what happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough call,</v>

44
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:22.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you see people now and then in </v>

45
00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:22.521
<v Speaker 1>life who they've really got it rough </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

46
00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>like 50 bad things are happening to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>

47
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

48
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder if you are bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and hostile.</v>

49
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

50
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 1>no wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you meet people and social hits</v>

51
00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 1>and again talked about this in the Gulag</v>
<v Speaker 1>archipelago.</v>

52
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>He said he met lots of people in a not </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

53
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>He met enough people to impress him in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the concentration camp system who didn't</v>

54
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>allow their misfortunes to corrupt them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something man,</v>

55
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>because maybe the only real misfortune </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to become corrupted.</v>

56
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a really useful thing to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:56.631
<v Speaker 1>maybe the rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the rest of it is trivial in </v>

58
00:02:56.631 --> 00:03:00.201
<v Speaker 1>comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a rough thing because you </v>

59
00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>can be in very harsh circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think there's something to that</v>

60
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>and the Lord was with Joseph and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a prosperous man and he was in the house</v>

61
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>of his master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptian and his master saw that the</v>

62
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Lord was with him and the Lord made all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he did to prosper in his hand.</v>

63
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's an echo of the idea that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered earlier about walking with </v>

64
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.590
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

65
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.670
<v Speaker 1>So Adam walked with God before he ate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fruit with eve and then he wouldn't </v>

66
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>walk with God and they had noah walked </v>
<v Speaker 1>with God and Abraham walked with God.</v>

67
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:25.650
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 1>that's that alignment with the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal.</v>

69
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something like that and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

70
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>we can think about that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical claim as well,</v>

71
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

72
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:41.401
<v Speaker 1>I've got thousands of letters now in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year from people who have told me </v>

73
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>that they were in a pit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right,</v>

74
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>and that they decided that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to try to put their lives together</v>

75
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>and that it worked and so that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

76
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they write surprised,</v>

77
00:03:58.451 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:03.901
<v Speaker 1>I decided that I was going to work hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>at what I was doing and I wasn't going </v>

79
00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>to lie any more than absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

80
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd give it a try for a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

81
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:11.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of good things started to </v>

82
00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:14.041
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it's like maybe that's how the </v>

83
00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:16.741
<v Speaker 1>world works now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it doesn't work like that all </v>

84
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:16.741
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

85
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Because you can get sliced off at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>knees.</v>

86
00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:22.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's an arbitrary element to </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence that's that you can't wish </v>

87
00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that there are.</v>

88
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that there aren't bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies and good strategies.</v>

89
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.440
<v Speaker 1>So I do think that one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental existential questions is </v>

90
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if things are going well for you in your</v>

91
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:44.251
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is are you absolutely certain that </v>

92
00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 1>you're doing absolutely everything you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can to put things in order?</v>

93
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you shouldn't complain because you </v>

94
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.621
<v Speaker 1>don't know to what degree you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually contributing or even causing </v>

95
00:04:52.621 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>the circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

96
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 1>that's a very annoying thing to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not trying to blame the victim.</v>

97
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that people end up with lung </v>

98
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.500
<v Speaker 1>cancer because they were exposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>asbestos.</v>

99
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to.</v>

100
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Although I also know too that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have lung cancer because you've been </v>

101
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 1>exposed to asbestos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be a tragedy or can be hell.</v>

102
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:13.651
<v Speaker 1>And to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that depends on how you conduct </v>

103
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:13.651
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
