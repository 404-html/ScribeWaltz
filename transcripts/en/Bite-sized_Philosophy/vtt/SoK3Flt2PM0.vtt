1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys ever see the Blair witch </v>
<v Speaker 1>project?</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you haven't?</v>

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a pretty lousy example.</v>

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a horror movie now.</v>

5
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>There's kind of two kinds of horror </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

6
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>There's the splatter type horror movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think actually those expose you to</v>

7
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:22.641
<v Speaker 1>discuss and then there's the fear kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of horror movie and that doesn't need to</v>

8
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>have any Gore at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes you afraid.</v>

9
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:30.921
<v Speaker 1>And the Blair witch project is very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>example of that because all that </v>

10
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:30.921
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing happens,</v>

11
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:35.810
<v Speaker 1>nothing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you think something terrible is </v>

12
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.661
<v Speaker 1>going to happen every second and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that something terrible is gonna </v>

13
00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:42.321
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps climbing through the whole movie </v>

14
00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:44.330
<v Speaker 1>and so what they do is put you in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of radical uncertainty and never </v>

15
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>let you off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

16
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so basically they're playing with your </v>

17
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>imagination and that can work very </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively.</v>

18
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Like it's often horror movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often more effective if they don't show </v>

19
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>you what's making those horrible noises </v>
<v Speaker 1>off screening,</v>

20
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because no matter what they show you,</v>

21
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:04.311
<v Speaker 1>the probability that he can be as </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally horrible as what other </v>

22
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>monsters you're dredging up out of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination is very low.</v>

23
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

24
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 1>what's reasonable to be afraid of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark because throughout our biological </v>

25
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of unfortunate people were devoured</v>

26
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>by things in the dark or hurt very badly</v>
<v Speaker 1>by them,</v>

27
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Etc.</v>

28
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>And wE're also daytime creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.080
<v Speaker 1>So we don't like the dark very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do to someone if you're </v>

30
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>going to initiate them is maybe you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>them when they're 13 and you put them in</v>

31
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>a really dark cave and caves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There Are so dark man,</v>

32
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in a cave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't believe how dark it is.</v>

33
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

34
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.810
<v Speaker 1>You can't see anything in a cave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't know how big the space </v>

35
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.920
<v Speaker 1>you're in is and you don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>small it is and you don't know whether </v>

36
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>or not it's going to collapse or when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to stay up.</v>

37
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.680
<v Speaker 1>And you don't know how far you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>underground,</v>

38
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>especially if the people who took you </v>
<v Speaker 1>there didn't,</v>

39
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked around in circles and did let you</v>

40
00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:03.291
<v Speaker 1>know where you were going and then maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>they leave and maybe they leave for </v>

41
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:07.071
<v Speaker 1>three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're sitting down there </v>

42
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:07.071
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

43
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>what are you thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly?</v>

44
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking the most horrible </v>

45
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.280
<v Speaker 1>thoughts you could possibly imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

46
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're never going to find me again.</v>

47
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>some horrible snake thing that lives in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the darkness is going to come and eat me</v>

48
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:26.061
<v Speaker 1>slowly because fast would be merciful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm and then I'm also going to go </v>

49
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>completely out of my mind so that even </v>
<v Speaker 1>if something doesn't eat me,</v>

50
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:35.991
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to come over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be worse than being dead </v>

51
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:38.061
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what you're doing in that </v>

52
00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:40.510
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're facing that demons of your own </v>

53
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.510
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

54
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>And if you can stand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you grow up.</v>

55
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's what an initiation ceremony </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests.</v>

56
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what you'll find if you look at</v>

57
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.840
<v Speaker 1>clinical theories of psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same motif applies if you want to </v>

58
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:59.361
<v Speaker 1>get better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to find out what you're </v>

59
00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:01.431
<v Speaker 1>avoiding and what you're afraid of and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe what you're by you and you have to</v>

60
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>expose yourself to that voluntarily and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to let that change you,</v>

61
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>and so it's not a pleasant prospect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

62
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not dancing through a field of </v>
<v Speaker 1>daisies,</v>

63
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With muzak play and it'S not follow your</v>

64
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

65
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not the natural unfolding of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive process.</v>

66
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:26.281
<v Speaker 1>It's not that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the voluntary confrontation with </v>

67
00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:28.981
<v Speaker 1>the things that make up life horrors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's interesting about it is that </v>

68
00:03:28.981 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an idea there that lurks under </v>

69
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.091
<v Speaker 1>the surface archetypally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is there's a lot more to you </v>

70
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:40.051
<v Speaker 1>than meets the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it won't be released unless it has </v>

71
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:43.591
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're not going to even figure </v>

72
00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:43.591
<v Speaker 1>out what it is until you put yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 1>peril.</v>

73
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that you might think like </v>

74
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.720
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're an introvert.</v>

75
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 1>You're socially awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're highly neurotic,</v>

76
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>so you feel a lot of anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

77
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 1>You don't like going to partieS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because the horrible pirate lives</v>

78
00:03:55.121 --> 00:04:00.121
<v Speaker 1>at parties and always glaring at you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>judging you and telling you how useless </v>

79
00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>and insufficient you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you go there.</v>

80
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't even look at people because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that if you did look at them,</v>

81
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>you just see the face of the judgmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrant,</v>

82
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.900
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't if you actually looked at </v>

83
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.421
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you won't because you avoid and so </v>

84
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.971
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go there and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to put yourself in this terrible </v>

85
00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:17.971
<v Speaker 1>situation and if you're lucky and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit of weight,</v>

86
00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:22.770
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to incorporate all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of information from the external </v>

87
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.371
<v Speaker 1>world that will help you develop your </v>
<v Speaker 1>social skills and make you more </v>

88
00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:26.371
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated.</v>

89
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 1>And even if that doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to learn that.</v>

90
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>You can tolerate your own fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

91
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:36.031
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's better to not be afraid or to </v>

92
00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 1>know that you can handle being afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously to not be afraid,</v>

93
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.790
<v Speaker 1>but give that up because that ain't </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening so that the next best thing </v>

94
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>and the realistic thing is to know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the master of your own fear.</v>

95
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.910
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of what we're going to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about in relationship to classical </v>

96
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 1>theories of personality is exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that the world isn't terrible,</v>

97
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>it's that the world is terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're a lot stronger than you think</v>

98
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>and the way you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

99
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:07.321
<v Speaker 1>And so part of that is the strength that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gather is partly the information </v>

100
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>that you gather when you go somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not good at.</v>

101
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:13.831
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're establishing new skills like </v>

102
00:05:13.831 --> 00:05:13.831
<v Speaker 1>you haven't university.</v>

103
00:05:13.831 --> 00:05:15.190
<v Speaker 1>But there's another part that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting that's related to the little</v>

104
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 1>video that I showed you at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

105
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Dna turns out to be a very complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

106
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.840
<v Speaker 1>And so if I put you in situation a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then dna codes,</v>

107
00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:29.841
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of proteins that help make</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the way that your mind is in the way </v>

108
00:05:29.841 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I take you and put you in another</v>

109
00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different genes turn on,</v>

110
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 1>and so what that means is that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a biological repository of potential use</v>

111
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.660
<v Speaker 1>lying dormant at the highest resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of your molecular structure,</v>

112
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.540
<v Speaker 1>and that if you push yourself and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of different directions and you </v>

113
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 1>find different things to pursue and test</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself against,</v>

114
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.840
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to turn on parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself that aren't currently on and </v>

115
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 1>god only knows what you'd be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you turned yourself completely on.</v>

116
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I could use a better metaphor.</v>

117
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a little bit more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shavano routines because they're </v>

118
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.210
<v Speaker 1>more in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is a initiation archetype,</v>

119
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>which I kind of just described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you can do this for yourself </v>

120
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.320
<v Speaker 1>and this is a good way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>BeaTs the alternative anyway.</v>

121
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.340
<v Speaker 1>So which is like the definition of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good way to live so mad and you're </v>

122
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.250
<v Speaker 1>trying to pursue something so you've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>a goal.</v>

123
00:06:44.251 --> 00:06:49.251
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have a goal and you don't </v>

124
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:49.251
<v Speaker 1>want to hold onto that too tightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he might be wrong.</v>

125
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.990
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be willing to let that go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a different goal,</v>

126
00:06:51.991 --> 00:06:55.080
<v Speaker 1>but you need to go and then you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're pursuing the goal,</v>

127
00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.630
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find out that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>some obstacles in your path,</v>

128
00:06:57.631 --> 00:07:02.631
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe some of those obstacles are </v>

129
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:02.631
<v Speaker 1>afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frightening,</v>

130
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:02.631
<v Speaker 1>tight.</v>

131
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the reason of a disgusting type,</v>

132
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to turn it into that kind </v>

133
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.551
<v Speaker 1>of person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those of you who are sort of </v>

134
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:11.550
<v Speaker 1>socialist utopia had left wingers might </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that way about business people.</v>

135
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't.</v>

136
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.510
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend that you get over it </v>
<v Speaker 1>as rapidly as possible.</v>

137
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.390
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think there's no way I'm going</v>

138
00:07:18.391 --> 00:07:22.520
<v Speaker 1>to act that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you sort of put it off limits saying,</v>

139
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.410
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're afraid to do what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to do next.</v>

140
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the rule.</v>

141
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Don't avoid doing things because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you feel negative emotion.</v>

142
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.670
<v Speaker 1>If you have to do those things in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pursue your goals,</v>

143
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.980
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do exactly the opposite.</v>

144
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're pursuing a goal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you find that you're afraid about </v>

145
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.191
<v Speaker 1>something and so you're avoiding it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you should think is a </v>

146
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:46.191
<v Speaker 1>hot look.</v>

147
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of something and I'm avoiding</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

148
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Dragon treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly there.</v>

149
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's precisely right.</v>

150
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.870
<v Speaker 1>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're afraid of the thing,</v>

151
00:07:57.871 --> 00:08:02.871
<v Speaker 1>then what that means is that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed enough to handle it and you </v>

152
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:06.021
<v Speaker 1>need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you should think about that as a </v>

153
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:06.021
<v Speaker 1>discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a positive discovery.</v>

154
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:09.480
<v Speaker 1>You found out where you have a weakness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're now able to address it.</v>

155
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.270
<v Speaker 1>So you know if you're an introvert and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it's friday night,</v>

156
00:08:12.271 --> 00:08:14.490
<v Speaker 1>I could go to this party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know I really don't want it.</v>

157
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

158
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:20.190
<v Speaker 1>that means I should go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right because</v>

159
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.870
<v Speaker 1>because you already know how to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you know how to do and it's </v>

160
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.340
<v Speaker 1>the things that you don't know how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bother you and oppress you.</v>

161
00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:35.590
<v Speaker 1>And of course those things are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be difficult to learn about,</v>

162
00:08:35.591 --> 00:08:40.591
<v Speaker 1>but you need to learn about them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to get yourself all switched </v>

163
00:08:40.591 --> 00:08:40.660
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that switched on?</v>

164
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Because then you'll be able to tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that life is fundamentally </v>

165
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.930
<v Speaker 1>suffering and so you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world doesn't get safer us.</v>

166
00:08:49.931 --> 00:08:51.850
<v Speaker 1>You developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact quite the contrary.</v>

167
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.970
<v Speaker 1>You just get more competent and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>better anyways because it's that you </v>

168
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.490
<v Speaker 1>don't want safety anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably want adventure.</v>

169
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 1>You probably want to be compelled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably want to be engaged.</v>

170
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want security,</v>

171
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:10.011
<v Speaker 1>you might as well be dead well because </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's happening then and that </v>

172
00:09:10.011 --> 00:09:10.011
<v Speaker 1>there's no danger level.</v>

173
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.800
<v Speaker 1>To be alive is to be contending with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

174
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 1>with the world and you want to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best at that that you can possibly be.</v>

175
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly what we're gonna learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>about as we go through the entire </v>

176
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.691
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But certainly the elements that have to </v>

177
00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 1>do with clinical psychology because all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the circulate around this fundamental</v>

178
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:29.310
<v Speaker 1>fee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to.</v>

179
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:34.311
<v Speaker 1>Because it's the fundamental story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind and we want to know what that </v>

180
00:09:34.311 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 1>fundamental story is because we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>human and you need to know the story and</v>

181
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:42.711
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can decide how you're gonna act it </v>

182
00:09:42.711 --> 00:09:44.781
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least you need to know the damn </v>

183
00:09:44.781 --> 00:09:44.781
<v Speaker 1>story first.</v>
