00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Elegance is an interesting concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very controversial.</v>

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.090
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that continually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens over and over again in </v>

4
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.791
<v Speaker 1>psychology is that psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover all sorts of new kinds of </v>

5
00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:20.001
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest two proponents of that sort </v>

6
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:24.741
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose we're Bob Sternberg who came </v>

7
00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:24.741
<v Speaker 1>up with this thing equaled practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

8
00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:29.181
<v Speaker 1>And then Howard Gardner who came up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theory of multiple intelligences </v>

9
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>which had a very large effect on </v>
<v Speaker 1>educational psychology,</v>

10
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the theory was first proposed.</v>

11
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's not saying much because </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

12
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:41.901
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to find a discipline</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more susceptible to fads than </v>

13
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>educational psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>

14
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each fat is worse than the previous one.</v>

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Gardner positive that I think there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

17
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there they are,</v>

18
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>seven or eight different intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic,</v>

19
00:00:58.531 --> 00:00:59.670
<v Speaker 1>musical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical,</v>

20
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>mathematical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spacial body,</v>

21
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>kinesthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intrapersonal and interpersonal.</v>

22
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>And people talk about emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and they talk about </v>

23
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>practical intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I'm concerned,</v>

24
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>all of that is complete rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's technical reasons for that.</v>

25
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's technical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical reasons for that.</v>

26
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is you can't just mess </v>
<v Speaker 1>up a word,</v>

27
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole point of having a word is so </v>

28
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.321
<v Speaker 1>that it defined some things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>described some things and doesn't </v>

29
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:30.321
<v Speaker 1>describe other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

30
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:35.000
<v Speaker 1>and so you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make the word intelligence a </v>

31
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 1>current for whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can say that the ability to dance</v>

32
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:43.611
<v Speaker 1>as a form of intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that is you blur </v>

33
00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>out the word so badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell what it means anymore.</v>

34
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.470
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would also point out we had </v>

35
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.421
<v Speaker 1>perfectly good words for those major </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence as we called them talents </v>

36
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 1>and so it's perfectly reasonable to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>a distinction between the talent and </v>

37
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

38
00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

39
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:04.491
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you know the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if if things look similar to some </v>

40
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then how do you know if they're the same</v>

41
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:07.440
<v Speaker 1>or different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what you do when you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the construct validity process.</v>

43
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:15.651
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you rated a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on their dancing ability and then</v>

44
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>you rated the number of people on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to multiply two digit,</v>

45
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.240
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two digit numbers in their head quickly </v>

46
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.700
<v Speaker 1>while then you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically if both of those were </v>

47
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.331
<v Speaker 1>intelligences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the people who could dance better </v>

48
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:35.421
<v Speaker 1>could multiply two digit numbers faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their head and that they would be </v>

49
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:40.491
<v Speaker 1>slightly positive story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

50
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens when I don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>any diet coke.</v>

51
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.740
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if intelligence was the right word to </v>

52
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.671
<v Speaker 1>subsume both of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what you see is that would be a </v>

53
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:59.811
<v Speaker 1>high correlation that people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>good dancers would also be the ones who </v>

54
00:02:59.811 --> 00:03:02.991
<v Speaker 1>could multiply most rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean multiply in their head,</v>

55
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

56
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extract out a single factor like that.</v>

57
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not the case that those things</v>

58
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:18.481
<v Speaker 1>associate like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for something to be one phenomena,</v>

59
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>the things that it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I've talked too much this </v>

60
00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:34.871
<v Speaker 1>semester,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things that are subsumed under </v>

61
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:40.371
<v Speaker 1>that definition have to be correlated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and highly correlated because otherwise </v>

62
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.070
<v Speaker 1>they're not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the definition of the same thing.</v>

63
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq is a very peculiar construct,</v>

64
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.850
<v Speaker 1>a very unique construct from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological perspective,</v>

65
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.880
<v Speaker 1>but also more generally from a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>science perspective because Iq has the </v>

66
00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:04.521
<v Speaker 1>most predictive validity of anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever discovered in the social sciences </v>

67
00:04:04.521 --> 00:04:04.950
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
