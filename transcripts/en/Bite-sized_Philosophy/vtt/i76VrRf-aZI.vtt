00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis Ck,</v>

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.290
<v Speaker 1>a while back talked about Tiger Woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I really liked it because people </v>

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.660
<v Speaker 1>were complaining about Tiger Woods in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his affairs.</v>

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also about our Arnold Schwarzenegger</v>

5
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:14.240
<v Speaker 1>in his affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.850
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that Louis Ck </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out quite in a very comical </v>

7
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.591
<v Speaker 1>manner was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well many men aren't having the affairs </v>

8
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>of Tiger Woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not because they're good man.</v>

9
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>It's because they don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he said,</v>

10
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 1>a busload of Swedish Swedish bikini </v>
<v Speaker 1>models waiting for them at the final </v>

11
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:43.131
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea would be that you should </v>

12
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>conduct yourself so that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive to many women.</v>

13
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that you have your pick of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you should pick one.</v>

14
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's a sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's a sacrifice of a sort.</v>

15
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange sacrifice because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to someone,</v>

17
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>a comedian recently who told me of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his experiences in Las Vegas.</v>

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.710
<v Speaker 1>So he went to Las Vegas with a sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>superstar and they went to a party.</v>

19
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:17.151
<v Speaker 1>And what literally happened at the party</v>
<v Speaker 1>was one woman brought forward a small </v>

20
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:24.111
<v Speaker 1>group of other women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All very attractive and basically told </v>

21
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 1>the sports legend that he could just </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick one of them and she would go home </v>

22
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.660
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

23
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>And so that had all been arranged </v>
<v Speaker 1>beforehand and he said that he's been in</v>

24
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>many situations where something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has happened and I thought,</v>

25
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>that sort of is appealing to the Hugh </v>
<v Speaker 1>hefner playboy,</v>

27
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>14 year old fantasy that sort of gripped</v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture from the 19 sixties onward.</v>

28
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>But imagine that you sleep casually with</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 women in,</v>

29
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a six month period or three month </v>

30
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>period for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a three week period.</v>

31
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pick your timeframe and you say,</v>

32
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

33
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.510
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

34
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ecstatic with yourself because </v>

35
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.270
<v Speaker 1>you've been validated by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity and I'm not making light of </v>

36
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.711
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not nothing to be attractive to </v>

37
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:15.501
<v Speaker 1>women like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really something to be attractive </v>

38
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.991
<v Speaker 1>to women like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't obvious to me that your </v>

39
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:23.061
<v Speaker 1>choice to conduct yourself in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner enriches your life and the life </v>

40
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:28.521
<v Speaker 1>of other people more in any way than </v>
<v Speaker 1>picking one person and actually having a</v>

41
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:33.741
<v Speaker 1>relationship with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only true that that promiscuous </v>

42
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:38.661
<v Speaker 1>pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say is better if you can actually </v>

43
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>divorce sexuality from all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of life,</v>

44
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>say well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about variety and it's about </v>

45
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 1>impulsive pleasure or maybe it could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>even slightly deeper than merely </v>

46
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>impulsive pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be shared,</v>

47
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>

48
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.640
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you can do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because sexuality isn't divorced from </v>

49
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>family and from morality and from all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other elements.</v>

50
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Your life and if you're a mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that and so you make a </v>

51
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make a decision not to capitalize on</v>

52
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>your opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to misuse your opportunities and you</v>

53
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge part of the me too phenomenon.</v>

54
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.040
<v Speaker 1>A huge part of this battle that's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>played out in our culture is a </v>

55
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.611
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the failure of men to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that now it's not only the </v>

56
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:29.161
<v Speaker 1>failure of men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me be absolutely clear about that </v>

57
00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:31.981
<v Speaker 1>because for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the example of the sports </v>

58
00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:35.761
<v Speaker 1>superstar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the women who are lining up in front of </v>

59
00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:39.001
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parading themselves and offering </v>

60
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>themselves are deeply complicit in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this pathological game.</v>

61
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 1>And so it's pretty clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropologically as well that,</v>

62
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual choice tends towards a prieto </v>

63
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for men.</v>

64
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:54.841
<v Speaker 1>So most men have very little selection </v>
<v Speaker 1>at their disposal disposal and a small </v>

65
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>number of men have excess opportunities.</v>

66
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>The question is what should that small </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of men do?</v>

67
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 1>And you might say capitalize on it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hell with the consequences.</v>

68
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 1>And like it's a powerful argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe it's wrong.</v>

69
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 1>It destabilizes the society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

70
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:20.641
<v Speaker 1>and I also don't think it does your soul</v>
<v Speaker 1>any good because the problem with </v>

71
00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 1>treating other people as casual sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners,</v>

72
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you also treat yourself that way</v>

73
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that that does you any</v>

74
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>good because you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless that's what you want to be.</v>

75
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be a casual partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

76
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.140
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

77
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that's a particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>noble ambition.</v>

78
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to do better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
