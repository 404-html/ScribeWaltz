1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been telling people online in </v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.911
<v Speaker 1>various ways and in lectures that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should start fixing up the world by </v>

3
00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:11.690
<v Speaker 1>cleaning up their room and I want it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just elaborate on that a little bit </v>

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.111
<v Speaker 1>before I get back to the lecture itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd say it's become this Internet </v>

5
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>weird Internet meme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a joke and good.</v>

8
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:26.991
<v Speaker 1>It's a jewel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really happy about the fact that so </v>

9
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:29.871
<v Speaker 1>much of this has got like the leaving of</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor and it's really important because </v>

10
00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>that's what stops things from </v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerating into,</v>

11
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>into conflict humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking about this idea of </v>

12
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.491
<v Speaker 1>cleaning up your room in relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mustard seed idea and you see the </v>

13
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:44.421
<v Speaker 1>thing about cleaning up your room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is also something I learned from </v>

14
00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Carl young and his studies on alchemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because for young,</v>

15
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>when the alchemist was attempting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the philosopher's stone,</v>

16
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>he was not only engaged in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation of the material world,</v>

17
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>but he was engaged in a process of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation that occurred at the same</v>

18
00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:59.780
<v Speaker 1>time as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the chemical Trent,</v>

19
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>as the chemical transformation.</v>

20
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>So it was a psychological work in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

21
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you want to sort out your room</v>
<v Speaker 1>and beautified because the beauty is </v>

22
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.201
<v Speaker 1>also important and let's say that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have is just a little room like </v>

23
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:15.411
<v Speaker 1>you're not rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're poor and you don't have any </v>

24
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:15.411
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing,</v>

25
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>but you've got your damn room and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got this space right in front of you.</v>

26
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:22.611
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a part of the cosmos that </v>

27
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you can come to grips with and you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

28
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:27.891
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's there in front of you right in </v>

29
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:27.891
<v Speaker 1>front of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

30
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:31.371
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how open your eyes are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's the proper answer because </v>

31
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:32.700
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w William Blake said this,</v>

32
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elvis Huxley made comments that were </v>

33
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>very similar that in a transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

34
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>you can see infinity in the finite and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

35
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

36
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>and you can see infinity in what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have within your grasp.</v>

37
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.400
<v Speaker 1>If you look and you could save,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's the case with your room,</v>

38
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 1>and so you want to clean up your room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>

40
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

41
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:58.551
<v Speaker 1>a room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his room is a place to sleep and so if </v>

42
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:02.001
<v Speaker 1>you set your room up properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you figure out how to sleep and </v>

43
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.761
<v Speaker 1>when you should sleep and how you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep and then you figure out when you </v>

44
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:08.331
<v Speaker 1>should wake up and then you figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what clothes you should wear </v>

45
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:10.851
<v Speaker 1>because they have to be arranged </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly in your dresser and then you </v>

46
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:10.851
<v Speaker 1>have to have some place to put your </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes and if you're going to have some</v>

47
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:15.741
<v Speaker 1>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out what you're </v>

48
00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:15.741
<v Speaker 1>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wear those clothes to do.</v>

49
00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that means you got to figure </v>

50
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.391
<v Speaker 1>out what you're going to do and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>your room has to serve that purpose </v>

51
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise it isn't set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

52
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't set up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't serve your purposes,</v>

53
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>you will be unhappy and not happy in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

54
00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:32.391
<v Speaker 1>Because the way that we perceive the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is as a place to move from point a</v>

55
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:37.821
<v Speaker 1>to point B in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if the place that we're in </v>

56
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>facilitates that movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're happy to be there.</v>

57
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.650
<v Speaker 1>And if the place that we're in serves as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an obstacle to that movement,</v>

58
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>then we're unhappy to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what it means to set up your room</v>

59
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>is that you have to have somewhere to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's worthwhile,</v>

60
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:55.521
<v Speaker 1>or you can set up your room and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>room has to be set up to facilitate </v>

61
00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing is,</v>

62
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have to make it beautiful,</v>

63
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 1>but that's not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

64
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Means you have to have some taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean you have to have </v>

65
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.200
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

66
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can be garish with money and</v>

67
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:11.221
<v Speaker 1>you can be tasteful with nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you need is taste and taste beats </v>

68
00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to beautifying things,</v>

69
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not that money is trivial because</v>

70
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:19.321
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But taste is crucial and people who are </v>

71
00:03:19.321 --> 00:03:21.961
<v Speaker 1>very artistically oriented can make </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful things out of virtually </v>

72
00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

73
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>the literature suggests that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make beautiful things,</v>

74
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>putting real constraints on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what you allow yourself to do,</v>

75
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>facilitates creativity instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interfering with it.</v>

76
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Because let's say you have to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>something out of nothing,</v>

77
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I suppose would be a Godly Act,</v>

78
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:42.391
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make something out of </v>

79
00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:44.221
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be creative in order to do </v>

80
00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:46.561
<v Speaker 1>that and so then to to beautify your </v>
<v Speaker 1>room means that you also have to develop</v>

81
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:51.691
<v Speaker 1>your capacity to be creative and so then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make your room shine,</v>

82
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>but then what will happen is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family isn't together,</v>

83
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 1>they will interfere with that.</v>

84
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.530
<v Speaker 1>You will interfere with that because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't have the discipline to do it </v>

85
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.950
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when you start building this,</v>

86
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little microcosm of perfection with</v>

87
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:10.531
<v Speaker 1>what you have at hand and it'll evoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the pathologies of everyone in your </v>

88
00:04:10.531 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>household.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wonder what the hell you're up to in</v>

89
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>there and they won't necessarily be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy because if you're.</v>

90
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>If they're in a lowly place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

91
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>and so are you and you're trying to move</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that,</v>

92
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 1>then the higher you move out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more the place they're in looks bad </v>

93
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

94
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>what they should do is celebrate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>victory over chaos and evil,</v>

95
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:33.541
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will happen instead is that they </v>

96
00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>will attempt to pull you back down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll attempt to,</v>

97
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>and I mean obviously all families don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>

98
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:41.941
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all families do that to some degree </v>

99
00:04:41.941 --> 00:04:42.790
<v Speaker 1>and some families do almost nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

100
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to organize your room,</v>

101
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have to confront </v>
<v Speaker 1>the devils in your house.</v>

102
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:54.781
<v Speaker 1>And that's often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's often a terrifying thing because </v>

103
00:04:54.781 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>some of those devils have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have lineages that go back many,</v>

104
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many generations and God only knows what</v>

105
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 1>you have to struggle with in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome that.</v>

106
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.170
<v Speaker 1>And so and then and so to sort yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>out into fix up your room is a </v>

107
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 1>nontrivial matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

108
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 1>and you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll learn by doing that.</v>

109
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:16.921
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you'll learn enough by </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that so that you can fix up your </v>

110
00:05:16.921 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 1>family a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then having done that,</v>

111
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:22.261
<v Speaker 1>you'll have enough character so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you try to operate in the world at </v>

112
00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe in the broader social spheres,</v>

113
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 1>that you will be a force for good </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of harm.</v>

114
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Because you will have learned some </v>
<v Speaker 1>humility by noting just how difficult it</v>
