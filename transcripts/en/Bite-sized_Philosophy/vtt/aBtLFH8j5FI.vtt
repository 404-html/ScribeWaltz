00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Being on forgetful to entertain </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangers for thereby some have </v>

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.811
<v Speaker 1>entertained angels unawares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a commentary from Matthew Henry,</v>

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.430
<v Speaker 1>who is a nonconformist minister and </v>
<v Speaker 1>author,</v>

4
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.120
<v Speaker 1>cheerful and obliging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manners in showing kindness are great,</v>

5
00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:19.990
<v Speaker 1>ornaments to piety or are condescending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord Vouch,</v>

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.290
<v Speaker 1>safest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not personal visits to us,</v>

7
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>yet still by his spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stands at the door and knocks.</v>

8
00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:32.071
<v Speaker 1>When we are inclined to open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he deigns to enter by his gracious </v>

9
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:35.131
<v Speaker 1>constellations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He provides a rich feast of which we </v>

10
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:35.131
<v Speaker 1>partake with him.</v>

11
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.990
<v Speaker 1>This is from revelations 3:20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Behold,</v>

12
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:43.991
<v Speaker 1>I stand at the door and knock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If any man hear my voice and open the </v>

13
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:47.321
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will come into him and will sup with </v>

14
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:47.321
<v Speaker 1>him and he with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.350
<v Speaker 1>the hyperlink nature of those quotes is </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite obvious.</v>

16
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>There's 10 or 15 things being said at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>

17
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:59.441
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is a reference to the idea that if </v>

18
00:00:59.441 --> 00:00:59.441
<v Speaker 1>you ask for something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be given to you.</v>

19
00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very strange idea,</v>

20
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>but I like that idea a lot and I believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

21
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.440
<v Speaker 1>in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has been true.</v>

22
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.830
<v Speaker 1>If it was that I wanted what I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking for because that's the real </v>

23
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.830
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

24
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>because the question is if you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

25
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.570
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to want it and what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>means is to sacrifice whatever is </v>

26
00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:22.760
<v Speaker 1>necessary to get it because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want it,</v>

27
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>and so there's an equation here and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not claiming it's ultimate accuracy,</v>

28
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.250
<v Speaker 1>but the equation is something like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want it unless you're willing to </v>

29
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.540
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice for it and if you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

30
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:38.210
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're scattered.</v>

31
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.110
<v Speaker 1>But if you do want at any make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper sacrifices,</v>

32
00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:47.111
<v Speaker 1>then God only knows what might happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a c.</v>

33
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:52.751
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I really like about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the existential philosophers is their </v>

34
00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:58.061
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on personal responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that many of them had an </v>

35
00:01:58.061 --> 00:02:01.481
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on the role that people had in </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaping their own destiny.</v>

36
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
<v Speaker 1>The exits for the existentialists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this was a consequence of </v>

37
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>the religious substructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

38
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.200
<v Speaker 1>of philosophical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was self evident that life was tragic</v>

39
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.740
<v Speaker 1>and bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but and then fair enough,</v>

40
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.770
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't where it ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next issue was,</v>

41
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are better ways,</v>

42
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.640
<v Speaker 1>better and worse ways of dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

43
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:27.641
<v Speaker 1>and the better way of dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that life is tragic and better is </v>

44
00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:27.641
<v Speaker 1>to</v>

45
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>pause it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self you could be and live </v>

46
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.331
<v Speaker 1>authentically in relationship to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the next issue and some.</v>

47
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.380
<v Speaker 1>This is something kierkegaard talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

48
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.980
<v Speaker 1>particularly when he talked about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity of being a knight of faith,</v>

49
00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:46.981
<v Speaker 1>is that the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is I think part of the light </v>

50
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 1>part of life that's the intractable </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure.</v>

51
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.670
<v Speaker 1>No one can take the adventure of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from you,</v>

52
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.240
<v Speaker 1>that they can't do it with good advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

53
00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.510
<v Speaker 1>because no one can demonstrate to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you straighten out a name at </v>

54
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.041
<v Speaker 1>what you want and make the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices that your life will turn out </v>

55
00:03:05.041 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>in the manner that you might want it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn out.</v>

56
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>It isn't in anyone else's purview to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make that judgment.</v>

57
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>The only person that can possibly figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that out is you.</v>

58
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>It's something that can't be stolen from</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

59
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's your destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a destiny that cannot be stolen </v>

60
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 1>from you and you can forgo it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>

61
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:27.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not willing to put in the effort </v>

62
00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:27.811
<v Speaker 1>because what if I fail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't put in the effort,</v>

64
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.150
<v Speaker 1>you will fail because life is hard and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes everything out of you to do it </v>

65
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:39.541
<v Speaker 1>properly so you will fail and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the proper sacrifices,</v>

66
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:45.151
<v Speaker 1>you might fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like the ambiguity and the </v>

67
00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:47.521
<v Speaker 1>story of Cain and Abel because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>never really told why God rejects canes </v>

68
00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:51.721
<v Speaker 1>offerings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's hands that came maybe isn't </v>

69
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 1>doing as good a job as he should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he certainly gets bitter about it,</v>

70
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 1>but there's no smoking pistol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't say,</v>

71
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:56.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain is a bad guy.</v>

72
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>He made terrible sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so god rejected him.</v>

73
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.230
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain might've been working pretty damn </v>

74
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.230
<v Speaker 1>hard and things still didn't work out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for them,</v>

75
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.611
<v Speaker 1>and I think that ambiguity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate in the story because that </v>

76
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:10.350
<v Speaker 1>ambiguity ambiguity is in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be.</v>

77
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>You'd be a fool to say that everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>always works out for everyone if they </v>

78
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 1>just do things right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

79
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very careless thing to say,</v>

80
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 1>given how much tragedy and catastrophe </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is in the world and how much of it</v>

81
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 1>seems to be undeserved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that still has very little bearing I</v>

82
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 1>think on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

83
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 1>on your own individual adventure and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity for</v>

84
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 1>the necessity for opening the door to </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you could be and,</v>

85
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.440
<v Speaker 1>and the necessity to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>

86
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.710
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe and I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why this most impossible </v>

87
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.460
<v Speaker 1>of versus you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock and the door will open.</v>

88
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Why that's believable is that I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>never met anyone who couldn't </v>

89
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>hypothesize a better them in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

90
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 1>All they had to do is ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

91
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you be better?</v>

92
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Thank well here's three ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

93
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>it's no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

94
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 1>You can think about that no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's small ways,</v>

95
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.820
<v Speaker 1>but you can almost always at least think</v>
<v Speaker 1>of something stupid that you're doing </v>

96
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 1>that you could quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that you do have this.</v>

97
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange thing and people that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have this built in capacity to pause it </v>

98
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.580
<v Speaker 1>a higher self and then to move towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and maybe maybe that's part of where </v>

99
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.171
<v Speaker 1>the religious instinct really came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking like really reductionistically </v>

100
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>like as a materialist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an evolutionary psychologist,</v>

101
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 1>we have this notion of the transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>

102
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:47.491
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that seems to be pervasive across </v>

103
00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:47.491
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

104
00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:50.221
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's the ultimate manifestation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human proclivity to be able to </v>

105
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:51.790
<v Speaker 1>pause it an ideal at all and to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

106
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 1>You pause it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An ideal,</v>

107
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.330
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you need that to move forward.</v>

108
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can pause it,</v>

109
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>an ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't you pause it?</v>

110
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate ideal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

111
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:04.811
<v Speaker 1>if you can then instantly you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious sensibility instantly and so </v>

112
00:06:04.811 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's because I've puzzled like </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a biologist,</v>

113
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is the basis of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious instinct because the idea that</v>

114
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>it's mere superstition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we can just dispense with that.</v>

115
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a human universal.</v>

116
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 1>You can evoke religious experiences all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of ways,</v>

117
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.030
<v Speaker 1>so we're not going to play that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some reason that that instinct </v>

118
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.751
<v Speaker 1>exists and this the first thing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it is to try to reduce it to </v>

119
00:06:28.751 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 1>something that's biological and leave it</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that.</v>

120
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Not to mess with the metaphysics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly could be the case that </v>

121
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.130
<v Speaker 1>it's the ultimate extension of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to pause it and ideal and we </v>

122
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.130
<v Speaker 1>also might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

123
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.280
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough because while the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal moves you forward,</v>

124
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:48.281
<v Speaker 1>it fills your life with meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that because it </v>

125
00:06:48.281 --> 00:06:50.981
<v Speaker 1>is in the movement towards your ideal </v>
<v Speaker 1>that life's meaning is to be attained </v>

126
00:06:50.981 --> 00:06:51.920
<v Speaker 1>and then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

127
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>how much meaning is there in moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward towards an ultimate ideal?</v>

128
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more meaning,</v>

129
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 1>even though it's more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>

130
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the open question.</v>
