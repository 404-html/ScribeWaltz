1
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>The sacrifice of the mother is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exemplified profoundly by Michelangelo's</v>

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.510
<v Speaker 1>sculpture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Pie Ada,</v>

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Mary is Contemplating Her son crucified </v>
<v Speaker 1>in ruins,</v>

4
00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>so that's his body after he's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucified.</v>

5
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.680
<v Speaker 1>It's her fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was through her.</v>

6
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:19.040
<v Speaker 1>He entered the great drama of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the meaning of this sculpture?</v>

7
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:24.041
<v Speaker 1>It's a great sculpture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an absolutely unbelievable </v>

8
00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:27.221
<v Speaker 1>sculpture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't believe that someone </v>

9
00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:30.280
<v Speaker 1>could exist who could make something up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it wasn't the only thing </v>

10
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.890
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something he just tossed off in a</v>

12
00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:36.680
<v Speaker 1>couple of months while he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>other unbelievable things,</v>

13
00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

14
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.740
<v Speaker 1>it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an object of contemplation,</v>

15
00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.840
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's integrate cathedral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrate city.</v>

16
00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:47.380
<v Speaker 1>It's an object of contemplation and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea is something like,</v>

17
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.390
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

18
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.080
<v Speaker 1>What's the role of a mother if she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>awake.</v>

19
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I had a client come to see me a while </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

20
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>not very long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman in about who's about 30 and trying</v>

21
00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:06.461
<v Speaker 1>to make decisions about her life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was pretty career oriented and so I </v>

22
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:12.251
<v Speaker 1>asked her about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although maybe having a bit of trouble </v>

23
00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>with their career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this many,</v>

24
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:14.270
<v Speaker 1>many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is an amalgam.</v>

25
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.750
<v Speaker 1>This is a story that's an amalgam and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to her about the other elements </v>

26
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

27
00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

28
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>there's only five things you do in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got your career down,</v>

30
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do outside of your career </v>

31
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>that's meaningful and engaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are things going with your family?</v>

32
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Could be your family of origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your siblings,</v>

33
00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have an intimate relationship and</v>

34
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>like what's your plan for your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>family?</v>

35
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>And apart from those five things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of something like get some </v>

36
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.011
<v Speaker 1>exercise now and then don't eat too </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly and try to stay away from the </v>

37
00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:49.011
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of the crime that kind of lays</v>

39
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>out life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you miss any of those five things</v>

40
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>or if you do any of those other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

41
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>then you're in trouble and you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with missing a couple of them.</v>

42
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>But not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

43
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>And she said something along the lines </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

44
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I should bring a child into</v>

45
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>this world.</v>

46
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

47
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:13.671
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to come up with something </v>

48
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:13.671
<v Speaker 1>better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a bloody cliche,</v>

49
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:13.671
<v Speaker 1>which is what I told her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

50
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must've thought that up when you were</v>

51
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

52
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your,</v>

53
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 1>that you can't do any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a very,</v>

54
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>very smart woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like creating your unique.</v>

55
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>You can't do any better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

56
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously this is a veil of tears and a,</v>

57
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a well of suffering and all of that.</v>

58
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.890
<v Speaker 1>If you asked 30 people who are wondering</v>
<v Speaker 1>about having children,</v>

59
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.280
<v Speaker 1>why they're wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 of them will say that.</v>

60
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.650
<v Speaker 1>And so that tells you how original it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

61
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:40.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not original at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a thought.</v>

62
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like this little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

63
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a meme or something that lives in </v>

64
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.221
<v Speaker 1>your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a thought and it's certainly </v>

65
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:50.221
<v Speaker 1>not something.</v>

66
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:52.270
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should just take it face value and say,</v>

67
00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:53.800
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not having a family.</v>

68
00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

69
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.550
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of look at that and you </v>

70
00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.550
<v Speaker 1>criticize it a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

71
00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pop,</v>

72
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.410
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the other one.</v>

73
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the other one that's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too many people on the planet </v>

74
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.450
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

75
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I really don't like that statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

76
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.290
<v Speaker 1>just who are you going to ask to leave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just how are you going to get them to </v>

77
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.290
<v Speaker 1>leave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

78
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a serious question and who says </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's too many people?</v>

79
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>What the Hell's wrong with people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways?</v>

80
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're running around ruining the planet.</v>

81
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like I think it was the club of Rome </v>

82
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.120
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who prophesied by the way that there </v>

83
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.120
<v Speaker 1>would be so many people on the planet by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the year 2000,</v>

84
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.260
<v Speaker 1>that there would be widespread </v>
<v Speaker 1>starvation and they were completely and </v>

85
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>utterly wrong about that and I think it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the club of Rome who either compared</v>

86
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>us to a virus or a cancer on the face of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>

87
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

88
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you think about people a,</v>

89
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 1>aren't you something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that something to think about?</v>

90
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>viruses and cancer.</v>

91
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with viruses and cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Invite them in and make them at home.</v>

92
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

93
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>he tried to eradicate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a bloody well,</v>

94
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:03.241
<v Speaker 1>watch your metaphors folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't clear that you come up </v>

95
00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>with them or that they run you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you better watch him.</v>

96
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.410
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary and Mary's the great mother,</v>

97
00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:13.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That she's the mother.</v>

98
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what Mary is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether she existed or not is not the </v>

99
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She exists,</v>

100
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.530
<v Speaker 1>at least as a hyper reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She exists as the mother.</v>

101
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the sacrifice of the mother?</v>

102
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's easy.</v>

103
00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:28.280
<v Speaker 1>If you're a mother and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a mother who's worth her salt,</v>

104
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.030
<v Speaker 1>you offer your son to be destroyed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

105
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

106
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.960
<v Speaker 1>that's what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

107
00:04:35.961 --> 00:04:38.780
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna be born and he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer.</v>

108
00:04:38.781 --> 00:04:42.800
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna have his trouble in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to have his illnesses.</v>

109
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.990
<v Speaker 1>He's going to face his failures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes and he's going to die.</v>

110
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're awake,</v>

111
00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:52.310
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you say,</v>

112
00:04:52.311 --> 00:04:57.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps he will live in a way that will </v>

113
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:58.220
<v Speaker 1>justify that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you try to have that happen and</v>

114
00:04:58.221 --> 00:05:00.650
<v Speaker 1>that's what makes you worthy of a statue</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

115
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.010
<v Speaker 1>But still the sacrifice of the mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it right to bring a baby into this </v>

116
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:11.520
<v Speaker 1>terrible world?</v>

117
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every woman asked yourself that </v>

118
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.060
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some say no.</v>

119
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>And they have the reasons Mary answers </v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

120
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary is the archetype of the woman who </v>

121
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.661
<v Speaker 1>answers yes to life voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that image means.</v>

122
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>And not because she's blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she knows what's going to happen.</v>

123
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 1>And so she's the archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the woman who says yes</v>

124
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>to life knowing full well what </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] life is not naive,</v>

125
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 1>not someone who got pregnant in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>backseat of the 1957 Chevy,</v>

126
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one,</v>

127
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:47.290
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one night of,</v>

128
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:47.960
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

129
00:05:47.961 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 1>of half drunk idiocy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that,</v>

130
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.650
<v Speaker 1>but consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously knowing what's to come and </v>

131
00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.511
<v Speaker 1>then also allows it to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's another thing that's a </v>

132
00:06:00.511 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 1>testament to the courage of mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And My mother was good at this.</v>

133
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 1>My mother's a very agreeable person too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable for her own good,</v>

134
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.870
<v Speaker 1>but that's what happens if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable because you're too agreeable </v>

135
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 1>if for your own good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the definition of agreeable.</v>

136
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.630
<v Speaker 1>And so she's a nice person and still is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily she's still alive and we've had </v>

137
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 1>a very good relationship and I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>always been able to make her laugh,</v>

138
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a good thing.</v>

139
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was tough cookie.</v>

140
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 1>That woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

142
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:27.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

143
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.940
<v Speaker 1>remember once she came across,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out playing in this spec baseball </v>

144
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.890
<v Speaker 1>diamond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little diamond in the empty lot.</v>

145
00:06:37.891 --> 00:06:42.891
<v Speaker 1>Really in this little town I grew up in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was about 10 and she walked by.</v>

146
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I was there with a bunch of my friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was about to have a fistfight with</v>

147
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.810
<v Speaker 1>this little tough kid that I hung around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

148
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.820
<v Speaker 1>And there were half girls on the team </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fistfight had some relationship </v>

149
00:06:54.241 --> 00:06:56.140
<v Speaker 1>to status maneuvering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.780
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

151
00:06:57.781 --> 00:06:59.970
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my mum walked by,</v>

152
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 1>she took a look and I could see from her</v>
<v Speaker 1>demeanor that she knew exactly what was </v>

153
00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:11.091
<v Speaker 1>about to happen and she looked for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second and then she walked by and I </v>

154
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:12.360
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

155
00:07:12.361 --> 00:07:14.730
<v Speaker 1>good work mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

156
00:07:14.731 --> 00:07:19.731
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like last bloody thing I needed at </v>

157
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.040
<v Speaker 1>that moment was for her to come charge </v>
<v Speaker 1>it up and say,</v>

158
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.870
<v Speaker 1>you boys aren't planning to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

159
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.070
<v Speaker 1>are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

160
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 1>well yeah mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're actually planning to have a </v>

161
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 1>fight and now that you came and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervened.</v>

162
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I actually lost before the God damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing even started.</v>

163
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 1>So two thumbs up for mum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was also the person that said </v>

164
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.020
<v Speaker 1>because I had some trouble with my dad </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>

165
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.930
<v Speaker 1>adolescent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had some trouble with me.</v>

166
00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:48.870
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 50 slash 50.</v>

167
00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:51.810
<v Speaker 1>That's for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably 70 slash 30 with me on the</v>

168
00:07:51.811 --> 00:07:55.080
<v Speaker 1>70 end of that being the trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>

169
00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 1>I left home when I was about 17 and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>said something really interesting when I</v>

170
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.990
<v Speaker 1>left home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said it was too good at home.</v>

171
00:08:03.991 --> 00:08:05.820
<v Speaker 1>You'd never leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

172
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 1>hey mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty good,</v>

173
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

174
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.100
<v Speaker 1>for an agreeable person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a real spine man.</v>

175
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.900
<v Speaker 1>So that was pretty good.</v>

176
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.130
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

177
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.490
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother that says this,</v>

178
00:08:18.491 --> 00:08:22.420
<v Speaker 1>the mother is the person who also says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out there,</v>

179
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.890
<v Speaker 1>take your God damn lumps because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough enough so that you can handle it.</v>

180
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.610
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't say you just stayed down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in your bedroom bruiting away </v>

181
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:38.100
<v Speaker 1>because the world is unfair and treating</v>
<v Speaker 1>you badly and your suffering is too </v>

182
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.010
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

183
00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:40.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of suffering out there,</v>

184
00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:43.720
<v Speaker 1>but you're a hell of a lot tougher than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you are.</v>

185
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.210
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
