1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to tell you this story.</v>

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.080
<v Speaker 1>It's written for four year old kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want you to take a look at it for </v>

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.161
<v Speaker 1>a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a different perspective and see if </v>

4
00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:13.280
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine exactly what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's saying.</v>

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>we all know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>A dragon is a fictitious creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reptilian,</v>

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>terrible lives forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathes fire hordes,</v>

9
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange combination of attributes.</v>

10
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Why would something terrible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient?</v>

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Hold a treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billy [inaudible] was rather surprised </v>

12
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>when he woke up one morning and found a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon in his room.</v>

13
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>It was a small dragon about the size of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a kitten.</v>

14
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>The dragon wagged it's tail happily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When billy patted his head.</v>

15
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.670
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:11.671
<v Speaker 1>in Chinese mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon is a positive figure in European </v>

17
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:17.851
<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dragon is something to face in </v>

18
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:20.281
<v Speaker 1>combat and destroy or something to face </v>
<v Speaker 1>in combat and build something out of the</v>

19
00:01:21.071 --> 00:01:26.071
<v Speaker 1>pieces leftover from the Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billy went downstairs to tell his mother</v>

20
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>no such thing as a dragon said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billy's mother,</v>

21
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.890
<v Speaker 1>and she said it like she meant it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember once my daughter had a </v>

22
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was about four,</v>

23
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.360
<v Speaker 1>this was at the time when she first </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to notice graffiti and litter </v>

24
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>and both graffiti and let her bothered </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

25
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't understand the motivations </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the graffiti artists and she </v>

26
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.241
<v Speaker 1>didn't like the fact that there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>litter cluttering up the world's order </v>

27
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:57.710
<v Speaker 1>and the reason she got sensitive to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a child was because children are </v>

28
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really dependent on order.</v>

29
00:01:58.231 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

30
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>realm of competence is rather </v>

31
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>restricted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'd like to see things.</v>

32
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Mac messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So little kids for example,</v>

33
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 1>they're not happy with you if you play a</v>
<v Speaker 1>game with them and then mess around with</v>

34
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>the rules of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like that at all.</v>

35
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>They think that that's immoral activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to shake up the structure of the game.</v>

36
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Well anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while she was pondering all this,</v>

37
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>she uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came into our bedroom one night and </v>

38
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dad,</v>

39
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>I had a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we all know,</v>

40
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nightmares aren't real.</v>

41
00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Just like dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams aren't real.</v>

42
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which raises the question of why in the </v>

43
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.611
<v Speaker 1>world you'd bother having them six or </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven hours a night every single day of </v>

44
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:38.571
<v Speaker 1>your life and why they're a recognized </v>
<v Speaker 1>feature of animal behavior all the way </v>

45
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>down to the amphibian level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

46
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I dreamt that there was a clear flowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>stream,</v>

47
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>but in this dream there was all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage and it scared me and bothered me</v>

48
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I woke up,</v>

49
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:49.440
<v Speaker 1>so I told her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

50
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>close your eyes and imagine the stream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's full of garbage.</v>

51
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>What should you do about it?</v>

52
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

53
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I should take the garbage out to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

54
00:02:57.931 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

55
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:03.591
<v Speaker 1>so picture this stream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Picture yourself cleaning the garbage </v>

56
00:03:03.591 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She calmed down and went back to sleep.</v>

57
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

58
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:11.251
<v Speaker 1>because dreams concentrate on threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that they present threats to </v>

59
00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:15.571
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threats you haven't been able to deal </v>

60
00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:15.571
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:18.000
<v Speaker 1>there's a part of your brain that tracks</v>
<v Speaker 1>threats and it's not really all that </v>

62
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some ways.</v>

63
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>All it does is say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

64
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.050
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem and it's waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your brain to conjure up </v>

65
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.411
<v Speaker 1>some solution to that problem and if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't conjure up a solution and it </v>

66
00:03:28.411 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>just presents the problem over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over and over and over,</v>

67
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>so people who have posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

68
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:38.431
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who've been really upset by their </v>

69
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:40.801
<v Speaker 1>contact with something unexpected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream about the same tragedy forever </v>

70
00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:45.390
<v Speaker 1>until they solve it and they solve it by</v>
<v Speaker 1>facing it and living it over and over </v>

71
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.860
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might think right off the bat </v>

72
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.531
<v Speaker 1>from listening to that little story that</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting to your four year old </v>

73
00:03:55.531 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 1>daughter who's just had a nightmare that</v>
<v Speaker 1>her fears aren't real and that the dream</v>

74
00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:02.911
<v Speaker 1>representation of them isn't real </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not tangible like a table </v>

75
00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>might not really be the best approach to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>

76
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 1>So you see billy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's pretty much got it right,</v>

77
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>right off the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

78
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.760
<v Speaker 1>The dragon wagged his tail happily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When billy padded it's head,</v>

79
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Bailey went downstairs to tell his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

80
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as a dragon said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billy's mother,</v>

81
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:24.781
<v Speaker 1>and she said it like she meant it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a dragon in this house.</v>

82
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Now the next thing you might wonder is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how often have you actually gone into a </v>

83
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.771
<v Speaker 1>house where there's a dragon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guess is if you don't take this </v>

84
00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:38.491
<v Speaker 1>particularly specifically and allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to use your imagination and to </v>

85
00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:42.571
<v Speaker 1>think metaphorically for a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've all encountered dozens of houses </v>

86
00:04:42.571 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 1>that were filled right to the rafters </v>
<v Speaker 1>with various dragons,</v>

87
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.010
<v Speaker 1>all of which were being studiously </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignored by the people who inhabited the </v>

88
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billy went back to his room and began to</v>

89
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:55.690
<v Speaker 1>dress the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came close to billy in a friendly manner</v>

90
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 1>and wagged his tail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but billy didn't pat it.</v>

91
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 1>If there is no such thing as something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's silly to patted on the head.</v>

92
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Merely washed his face and hands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>went down to breakfast.</v>

93
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 1>The dragon went along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bigger.</v>

94
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost the size of a dog.</v>

95
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Billy sat down at the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dragon sat down on the table.</v>

96
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 1>This sort of thing was not usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>permitted,</v>

97
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:24.370
<v Speaker 1>but there wasn't much billy's mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do about it.</v>

98
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>She'd already said there was no such </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing as a dragon head.</v>

99
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:32.731
<v Speaker 1>If there's no such thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell it to get down off the </v>

100
00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:36.211
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I sit with friends of mine who</v>

101
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:40.470
<v Speaker 1>had very young children to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

102
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 1>and the children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three years old,</v>

103
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>don't sit at the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sit on the table or they run around</v>

104
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:50.620
<v Speaker 1>the table or they run around the table </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pull things off the table,</v>

105
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.890
<v Speaker 1>or they run around the house and pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>things off all the shelves in the house </v>

106
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.430
<v Speaker 1>and keep their parents so busy chasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>them around that they have no time </v>

107
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever to interact as adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

108
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.370
<v Speaker 1>you have to wonder under those </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances whether you're dealing </v>

109
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>with a child or a dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

110
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.670
<v Speaker 1>and you also might wonder whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon is large and unruly,</v>

111
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.090
<v Speaker 1>precisely because the parents are </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely unwilling to admit that it </v>

112
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.090
<v Speaker 1>actually exists.</v>

113
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Mother made some pancakes for billy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the dragon ate them all.</v>

114
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Mother made some more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to dragon eight,</v>

115
00:06:29.501 --> 00:06:32.920
<v Speaker 1>those two mother kept making pancakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>until she ran out of batter.</v>

116
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Billy only got one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said that's all he really wanted.</v>

117
00:06:36.131 --> 00:06:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one time,</v>

118
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.150
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

119
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.370
<v Speaker 1>an acquaintance of ours in Boston </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought their son over to be Babysat at </v>

120
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.470
<v Speaker 1>our house and his nanny had just been in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car accident.</v>

121
00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:52.240
<v Speaker 1>So he was being shunted from house to </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

122
00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his parents went off to work and uh,</v>

123
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.740
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have very good reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kid,</v>

124
00:06:56.741 --> 00:07:01.741
<v Speaker 1>he was about four and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came over to our house and with his </v>

125
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 1>mother in the morning and she dropped </v>
<v Speaker 1>them off and she said,</v>

126
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably won't eat all day,</v>

127
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 1>but that's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

128
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's four.</v>

129
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.850
<v Speaker 1>If he doesn't eat all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not all right.</v>

130
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because kids,</v>

131
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>if they don't eat their basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>

132
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:22.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't sleep,</v>

133
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 1>they don't eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're horrible.</v>

134
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't all right that he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

135
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

136
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's some sort of dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with this child that happens </v>

137
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.110
<v Speaker 1>to be interviewing perhaps with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to eat.</v>

138
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.500
<v Speaker 1>So I came back at noon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife had taken care of the children </v>

139
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.440
<v Speaker 1>that day and I walked in the house and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other four or five kids that we had </v>

140
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.840
<v Speaker 1>in house or off playing in this little </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid was standing in the corner,</v>

141
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.280
<v Speaker 1>like really isolated and looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:53.020
<v Speaker 1>upset fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went over and I poked him a bunch </v>

143
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 1>because generally if you poke a kid a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

144
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll go like this,</v>

145
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:56.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of back off,</v>

146
00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:59.750
<v Speaker 1>but sooner or later you can crack them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll smile and then they'll play.</v>

147
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Not this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

148
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 1>there's no bloody way who's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play with me.</v>

149
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:07.151
<v Speaker 1>And that was that like he'd already </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned that adults should either be </v>

150
00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:11.891
<v Speaker 1>ignored or that they were trouble and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going to let any adults into his </v>

151
00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:16.421
<v Speaker 1>little world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is absolutely a dragon </v>

152
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 1>associated with that little boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was eating all his pancakes.</v>

153
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.220
<v Speaker 1>The only went upstairs to brush his </v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>

154
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Mothers started clearing the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dragon who was quite as big as </v>

155
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.821
<v Speaker 1>mother by this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made himself comfortable in the whole </v>

156
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 1>rug and went to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked this one.</v>

157
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 1>By the time billy came back downstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon had grown so much.</v>

158
00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:41.261
<v Speaker 1>He filled the hall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we had to go around by way of the </v>

159
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:41.261
<v Speaker 1>living room to get to where his mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

160
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragons grew so fast.</v>

161
00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Said Billy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as a dragon.</v>

162
00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Said mother firmly</v>

163
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 1>winning the downstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took mother all morning what?</v>

164
00:08:55.561 --> 00:09:00.561
<v Speaker 1>With the dragon in the way and having to</v>
<v Speaker 1>climb in and out of windows to get from </v>

165
00:09:00.561 --> 00:09:00.561
<v Speaker 1>room to room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

166
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:06.390
<v Speaker 1>you think back in your own experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've gone to a house where </v>

167
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.141
<v Speaker 1>there's a dragon hiding underneath the </v>
<v Speaker 1>living room rug and nobody's saying </v>

168
00:09:09.141 --> 00:09:12.801
<v Speaker 1>anything about it and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long does it take to get something </v>

169
00:09:12.801 --> 00:09:16.500
<v Speaker 1>absolutely simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Done in a house that's absolutely jammed</v>

170
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 1>to the rafters with unfinished business </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>

171
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:24.801
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Organizing people in a household like </v>

172
00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:27.081
<v Speaker 1>that to even do something as simple as </v>
<v Speaker 1>go out for breakfast in the morning or </v>

173
00:09:27.081 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 1>even perhaps to make a meal is virtually</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>

174
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

175
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:35.841
<v Speaker 1>because there's something going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the household that has been studiously </v>

176
00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:40.401
<v Speaker 1>ignored for a very long time and has </v>
<v Speaker 1>grown so large as a consequence that it </v>

177
00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:45.441
<v Speaker 1>occupies the whole domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By noon,</v>

178
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.950
<v Speaker 1>the dragon filled the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its head hung out the front door,</v>

179
00:09:50.951 --> 00:09:55.951
<v Speaker 1>it's tail hung out the back door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there wasn't a room in the house </v>

180
00:09:55.951 --> 00:09:55.990
<v Speaker 1>that didn't have some part of the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

181
00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.890
<v Speaker 1>When the dragon awoke from his nap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was hungry.</v>

182
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.680
<v Speaker 1>The bakery truck went by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The smell of fresh bread was more than </v>

183
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.671
<v Speaker 1>the dragon could resist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ran down the street after the bakery </v>

184
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:14.671
<v Speaker 1>truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The house went along,</v>

185
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:16.210
<v Speaker 1>of course like the shell on a snail.</v>

186
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.650
<v Speaker 1>The mailman was just coming up the path </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some mail for the big speeds.</v>

187
00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:32.490
<v Speaker 1>When their house rush past him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>headed down the street,</v>

188
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.470
<v Speaker 1>he chased the big speed house for a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>blocks,</v>

189
00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:35.970
<v Speaker 1>but he but he couldn't catch it.</v>

190
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.910
<v Speaker 1>When Mr Bixby came home for lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing he noticed was that his </v>

191
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 1>house was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily one of the neighbors was able to</v>

192
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:49.260
<v Speaker 1>tell them which way it went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

193
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.040
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing happens to people not</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrequently to write,</v>

194
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.100
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not really looking around much </v>

195
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.920
<v Speaker 1>at what's going on and they come home </v>
<v Speaker 1>from work one day and their house is </v>

196
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 1>gone and what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

197
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:06.651
<v Speaker 1>maybe their children have become </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely alienated from them or maybe </v>

198
00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:10.050
<v Speaker 1>their wife has decided suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course not.</v>

199
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 1>So suddenly to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

200
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to this story,</v>

201
00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:18.360
<v Speaker 1>it's because something ignored was </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing in the house.</v>

202
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Mr [inaudible] got in his car and went </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for the house.</v>

203
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.740
<v Speaker 1>He studied all the houses as he drove </v>
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>

204
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Finally he saw one that looked familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billy and Mrs.</v>

205
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Bixby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're waving from an upstairs window,</v>

206
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in the eighties and nineties in India</v>

207
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:45.210
<v Speaker 1>when our house was being built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the local priest equivalent to the </v>

208
00:11:45.411 --> 00:11:50.411
<v Speaker 1>priest would come by to set the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation stone and when he set the </v>

209
00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:54.191
<v Speaker 1>foundation stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he take a big spike and drove it into </v>

210
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:58.050
<v Speaker 1>the ground and the reason he drove it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the ground at the place where the </v>

211
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 1>foundation was going to be laid was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the great dragon that is underneath</v>

212
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:05.041
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>firmly pinned down by its head so it </v>

213
00:12:05.041 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 1>couldn't move and shake the house to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bits.</v>

214
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.660
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

215
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.260
<v Speaker 1>it means the same thing that's meant in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new testament when you're told not </v>

216
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:13.360
<v Speaker 1>to build your house on a foundation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sand,</v>

217
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:18.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter how good the house is </v>

218
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:18.790
<v Speaker 1>or how well constructed it is or how </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich it is.</v>

219
00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 1>If the foundation is made out of sand or</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it rests on top of a dragon,</v>

220
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.050
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing in that household that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever going to be accomplished.</v>

221
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 1>That's positive and the wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the display that the house might consist</v>

222
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:35.731
<v Speaker 1>of is nothing but a sham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr [inaudible] climbed over the dragon's</v>

223
00:12:36.891 --> 00:12:39.650
<v Speaker 1>head onto the porch roof and through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>upstairs window.</v>

224
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.540
<v Speaker 1>How did this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Bixby asked.</v>

225
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.450
<v Speaker 1>It was the dragon said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billy,</v>

226
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.870
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mother started to say,</v>

227
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.140
<v Speaker 1>there is a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billy insisted a very big dragon,</v>

228
00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.420
<v Speaker 1>and billy padded the dragon on the head.</v>

229
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:05.410
<v Speaker 1>The dragon wagged his tail happily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then even faster than it had grown.</v>
