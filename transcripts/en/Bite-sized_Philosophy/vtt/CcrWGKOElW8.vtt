1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't let the orderliness part of </v>

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>you get the upper hand so terribly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible for you to live.</v>

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.740
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to girls who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>had [inaudible] by the way.</v>

4
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>You know how you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this idea with regards to </v>

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.981
<v Speaker 1>anorexia that it's often high achieving </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls who have it and while it's hyper </v>

6
00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>conscientious girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get so disgust sensitive.</v>

7
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>They can't stand their own bodies and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.280
<v Speaker 1>then they start being able to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>their bodies properly and so what they </v>

9
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.280
<v Speaker 1>do instead of looking at their whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

10
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.220
<v Speaker 1>they lose the ability to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only can see parts of their body </v>

11
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.130
<v Speaker 1>and then they can't tell the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between a part that's healthy and well </v>

12
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.700
<v Speaker 1>shaped and a fat part and so anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that's,</v>

13
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.840
<v Speaker 1>that's what would you call of dubious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's hard to measure becomes </v>

14
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>impossible to see.</v>

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>So either an anorexic client at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

16
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.780
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't a very big woman maybe about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this big and thin.</v>

17
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

18
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.430
<v Speaker 1>And so I was trying to work with her on </v>
<v Speaker 1>her body perception disorder and one of </v>

19
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>the things I did was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had her come and sit beside me,</v>

20
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>so I was sitting like this and so is </v>
<v Speaker 1>she.</v>

21
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you look at our two thighs,</v>

22
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 1>which one is bigger?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like mine was like 40 percent bigger.</v>

23
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.670
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I can't tell they look the same to </v>

24
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.670
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

25
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.670
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're going to do.</v>

26
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I let her do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

27
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 1>you take a pencil and also done a piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of paper and you just trace my thigh.</v>

28
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can put that piece of paper</v>

29
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>underneath your thigh and trace it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can look at the difference.</v>

30
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had her do that and she looked at </v>

31
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>the two pieces of paper and she couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it.</v>

32
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>She could not believe that that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the case because her perception</v>

33
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>had become so disordered that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible for her to see the real shape</v>

34
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:43.341
<v Speaker 1>of her body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we would go outside and I would ask </v>

35
00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:43.341
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>is that person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that person fat and with other people</v>

37
00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>she could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with her own body,</v>

38
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>not a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't see it properly at all.</v>

39
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.500
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a real obsession with </v>
<v Speaker 1>purity among women who have anorexia and</v>

40
00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:58.501
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd like to starve themselves right </v>

41
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:00.291
<v Speaker 1>down to the bone because the bone is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of pure and white and there's no </v>

42
00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:04.371
<v Speaker 1>excess tissue on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anorexia also looks like a </v>

43
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>disease of disgust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very,</v>

44
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:05.890
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to.</v>

45
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 1>She she thought and very black and white</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

46
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I had her do at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point was said she hasn't music.</v>

47
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:16.581
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I either really like a song or I don't </v>

48
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:16.581
<v Speaker 1>like it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

49
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you've got a music collection,</v>

50
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.360
<v Speaker 1>why don't you go through like 20 of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those songs and rate them on a scale </v>

51
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>from one to 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she couldn't do it.</v>

52
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.620
<v Speaker 1>It was either yes or no orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

53
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>The boundaries around the categories </v>
<v Speaker 1>were absolutely segregated.</v>

54
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.180
<v Speaker 1>And her apartment tended to be decorated</v>
<v Speaker 1>in black and white and she was hyper </v>

55
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>so everything in the apartment was </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily orderly,</v>

57
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:43.671
<v Speaker 1>well put away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't stand to see anything </v>

58
00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:43.671
<v Speaker 1>disgusting on the counters and that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

59
00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>So very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult disorder to treat </v>

60
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>anorexia very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>

61
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

62
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you can see how it can go wrong because </v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

63
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>when you're eating your disgust systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>are on alert,</v>

64
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

65
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>you want the thing you want to and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely don't want the thing you </v>

66
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>don't want to eat and your mouth is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive to that sort of thing.</v>

67
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>You know the texture and all of that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sense of smell is very sensitive to</v>

68
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:12.781
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to eat anything that's </v>

69
00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>contaminated or poisonous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's another situation like sex where</v>

70
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.220
<v Speaker 1>the reward system is driving you forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

71
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>to engage in a consumer story behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the disgust system is right there,</v>

72
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.970
<v Speaker 1>mo modulating and moderating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a tension between those two </v>

73
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's already always at work.</v>

74
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>And with the anorexic types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disgust sense of disgust system gets</v>

75
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:36.091
<v Speaker 1>the upper hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was also extraordinarily </v>

76
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.761
<v Speaker 1>judgemental and perfectionistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that goes along with it because </v>

77
00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>orderly people are judgemental and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectionistic.</v>

78
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a perfectionist,</v>

79
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>often what that means is you have very </v>
<v Speaker 1>high levels of orderliness and very high</v>

80
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:50.851
<v Speaker 1>levels of neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those two things chase each other </v>

81
00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:53.761
<v Speaker 1>around like mad because you can't stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you would make a mistake </v>

82
00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:57.720
<v Speaker 1>and you get anxious about it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you get stuck in this </v>

83
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>perfectionistic mindset and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of it.</v>

84
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
