1
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>I was reading a study the other day on </v>
<v Speaker 1>marital stability.</v>

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Gottman has done some really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of couples behavior.</v>

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>He has set up a lab that's basically a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed and breakfast and he brings couples </v>

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.861
<v Speaker 1>in there for a weekend and he had wires </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mop physiologically and monitors </v>

5
00:00:21.861 --> 00:00:26.391
<v Speaker 1>their reactivity and so what is he can </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict whether a couple's going to </v>

6
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>divorce with 95,</v>
<v Speaker 1>94 percent accuracy.</v>

7
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is he found?</v>

8
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>He found two categories of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

9
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>He's identified two phenomena that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>very much worth knowing.</v>

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.090
<v Speaker 1>The first is that the couples who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get divorced and they come into</v>

11
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>the bed and breakfast and they speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other quite commonly,</v>

12
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's more walking on eggs calm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're speaking with each other,</v>

13
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>normally their physiology is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very aroused and so.</v>

14
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>So they're sort of aroused like someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's facing a predator.</v>

15
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>So you might think about not unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple as Predator and prey to each </v>

16
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.991
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the words are there mostly to </v>

17
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 1>stop predatory activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to actually communicate anything.</v>

18
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just to keep the surface calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might think,</v>

19
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:24.451
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's under the surface and what it's </v>

20
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>under the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Freud would say it's what's under the</v>

21
00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:30.040
<v Speaker 1>surface is unconscious and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can say,</v>

22
00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:31.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's under the surface is one of these</v>

23
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies and it's all banged up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>twisted and,</v>

24
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>and not in reasonable shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people don't want to open the </v>

25
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.780
<v Speaker 1>door to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

26
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 1>But they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a Freudian slip.</v>

27
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:46.840
<v Speaker 1>So let's say this goes to the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the Gottman's observations.</v>

28
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.950
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

29
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 1>the woman goes over to the window and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she says,</v>

30
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.810
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a cardinal outside,</v>

31
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardinals,</v>

32
00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 1>that bright red bird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of cool looking,</v>

33
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a trivial thing in some </v>

34
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>

35
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.640
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a little positive thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

36
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.270
<v Speaker 1>20 of them in a day's good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

37
00:02:10.271 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>So then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.010
<v Speaker 1>the partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the husband in this example has a two by</v>

39
00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:18.160
<v Speaker 1>two matrix of choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>

40
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.980
<v Speaker 1>who the hell cares about your stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>bird?</v>

41
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one.</v>

42
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.950
<v Speaker 1>The second one is then you go over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the bird,</v>

43
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the third one is you don't make</v>

44
00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:35.521
<v Speaker 1>the contempt noise but you act it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fourth one is you go over there </v>

45
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.570
<v Speaker 1>like a civilized human being and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

46
00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:40.720
<v Speaker 1>and that you're interacting with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you care for and you take a look at</v>

47
00:02:40.721 --> 00:02:42.650
<v Speaker 1>the damn bird and you're happy about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it.</v>

48
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's as truthful and real as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can manage.</v>

49
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the option,</v>

50
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a Freudian slip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Because what it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole monster underneath that </v>

52
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.481
<v Speaker 1>and the monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the disorganization in this entire </v>

53
00:03:03.481 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the might be.</v>

54
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.030
<v Speaker 1>We have been tormenting each other about</v>
<v Speaker 1>various things for the last 10 years and</v>

55
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:17.521
<v Speaker 1>none of them are resolved and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>very happy about you for so many </v>

56
00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:22.321
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even remember all of them and I </v>

57
00:03:22.321 --> 00:03:25.291
<v Speaker 1>can't enumerate them right now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would take forever and maybe we </v>

58
00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 1>would have a huge fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

59
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to come over there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you happy with your stupid bird and</v>

60
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:36.661
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to indicate that suddenly so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't call me a son of a bitch </v>

61
00:03:36.661 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>because I've just sighing and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'll say if you do ask me,</v>

62
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to load all that up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to deliver it to you.</v>

63
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>And what's going to happen to you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're smart,</v>

64
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>is your heart rate's going to go way up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're being attacked.</v>

65
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the good couples do,</v>

66
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 1>the couples that you know will stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>together is they respond to each other's</v>

67
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>bids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He calls them bids.</v>

68
00:03:56.681 --> 00:04:01.681
<v Speaker 1>And so if one person wants to share some</v>
<v Speaker 1>little trivial daily positive thing with</v>

69
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

70
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't carrying around a bloody cartload </v>

71
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>of resentment and is able to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in a positive way.</v>

72
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>And that way the general interactions </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the couples stay positive.</v>

73
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>But that's also because they've worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>this out.</v>

74
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's got to be because they </v>

75
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 1>work it out because the couples who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically reactive to each other,</v>

76
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.140
<v Speaker 1>they're communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's all sorts of horror </v>

77
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>underneath the surface and we're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out,</v>

78
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:36.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that's underneath the </v>

79
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:36.691
<v Speaker 1>surface?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the structure of the unconscious?</v>

80
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the structure of the unconscious </v>

81
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.121
<v Speaker 1>and it's either well structured and </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional and mutually agreed upon and </v>

82
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>as explicit as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's this constantly.</v>
