1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.630
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio was transformed into a victim </v>

2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.361
<v Speaker 1>and he's offered this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's offered this identity and he takes </v>

3
00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

4
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>it's partly because he's deceived and </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulated,</v>

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's also partly because of the fox </v>
<v Speaker 1>offers him the abandonment of </v>

6
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.351
<v Speaker 1>responsibility as payment for as payment</v>
<v Speaker 1>for adopting the victim identity.</v>

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>So this is where his own lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality,</v>

8
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is all about Pinocchio.</v>

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Development as a character plays a role </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his demise.</v>

10
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.970
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm a victim than everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>owes me something and I don't have to </v>

11
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>take any responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I've wondered,</v>

12
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.060
<v Speaker 1>here's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be that the sense of meaning </v>

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.070
<v Speaker 1>that life can provide to you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportionate to the amount of </v>

14
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.950
<v Speaker 1>responsibility you decide to take on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

15
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>That'd be very strange if it was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>

16
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:59.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because responsibility of course is a </v>

17
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:01.461
<v Speaker 1>kind of weight obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's difficult to take on </v>

18
00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.491
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if any positive emotion that you </v>

19
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:08.991
<v Speaker 1>feel and your control of anxiety and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>control over pain is dependent on the </v>

20
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>activation of these systems that watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>you move towards a desired goal,</v>

21
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>then the more complete and weighty the </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal is,</v>

22
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 1>the more kicked there's going to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the observation that you're moving </v>

23
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 1>towards it.</v>

24
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kinda already know this because </v>

26
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have observed in your own life </v>

27
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 1>that when you're engaged in something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you believe in,</v>

28
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>that the time passes properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>you can see this even if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're reading a paper and it's </v>

30
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.451
<v Speaker 1>actually related in some intelligible </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner to something that you want to </v>

31
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though it's difficult,</v>

32
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>you get engaged in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can remember it better,</v>

33
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:53.121
<v Speaker 1>you can process it better and you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not so likely to fall asleep and </v>

34
00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>you're not so likely to want to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>distractions.</v>

35
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 1>All of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get into it and it would be very</v>

36
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>interesting if that was proportionate to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree of responsibility that you're</v>

37
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 1>willing to shoulder and I think you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a strong case for that.</v>

38
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I've also often wondered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine you could offer people a choice.</v>

39
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Here's the choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>

40
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life isn't meaningful.</v>

41
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:19.491
<v Speaker 1>Denialists have got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no meaning in your life and </v>

42
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason for you to accept any </v>

43
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.311
<v Speaker 1>responsibility so you can live a </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for your life and maybe </v>

44
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the impulsive pleasure seeking </v>
<v Speaker 1>better responsibility,</v>

45
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>free life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the price you pay is that it doesn't</v>

46
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 1>get to be meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you could say to someone,</v>

47
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do the opposite.</v>

48
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 1>We're going to say you can live a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful life,</v>

49
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's only going to be as meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the amount of responsibility that </v>

50
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

51
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would people choose?</v>

52
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Because everybody also always makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>noises about wanting to have a </v>

53
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>meaningful life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the price you pay for that is the</v>

54
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:57.831
<v Speaker 1>adoption of responsibility that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obvious that people would choose </v>

55
00:02:57.831 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>meaning over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.500
<v Speaker 1>over pointless pursuits if they had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the benefit they go out for choosing </v>

57
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:10.171
<v Speaker 1>the pointless pursuits was that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>really didn't have to care about </v>

58
00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:10.171
<v Speaker 1>anything they ever did.</v>

59
00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snow responsibility.</v>

60
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what Pinocchio is </v>
<v Speaker 1>offered.</v>

61
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the coachman offers </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

62
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:18.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's interesting because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>so far it's been the Fox and the cat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were kind of to bid hoods.</v>

64
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:27.331
<v Speaker 1>And so the pathological pathway that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they offer Pinocchio is not the worst of</v>

65
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>the pathological pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here,</v>

66
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.920
<v Speaker 1>at least as far as the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collective imagination that created </v>

67
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.731
<v Speaker 1>this movie is concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this is where you get to the most </v>

68
00:03:38.731 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>pathological form of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it temptation.</v>

69
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's the temptation to engage in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to abandon responsibility and to engage </v>

70
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:51.331
<v Speaker 1>in impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure seeking short term pleasure </v>

71
00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:56.011
<v Speaker 1>seeking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the Fox pretending to be a </v>

72
00:03:56.011 --> 00:03:56.011
<v Speaker 1>doctor investigating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

73
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio's illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He makes some notes,</v>

74
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:04.711
<v Speaker 1>which is all just meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scribbled,</v>

75
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like white noise and it doesn't </v>

76
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.011
<v Speaker 1>matter that the arguments that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>making is are completely incoherent and </v>

77
00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter that he actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know anything.</v>

78
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:20.101
<v Speaker 1>He what he's selling is easy to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Pinocchio buys it and by the end </v>

79
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>of the conversation with the Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's pretty convinced that he's useless </v>

80
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.140
<v Speaker 1>and it needs a vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

81
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.460
<v Speaker 1>this is anita postage inedible situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

82
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.640
<v Speaker 1>which I touched on the other lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

83
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's imagine that you have a child that</v>

84
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>is a little on the neurotic side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so high negative emotion and maybe one </v>

85
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 1>that's also a little bit on the east </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

86
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>so has a variety of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say relatively minor ailments,</v>

87
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:58.441
<v Speaker 1>but the ailments nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means as a parent will say,</v>

88
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:00.430
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this example,</v>

89
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 1>because I want to use the apple example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to make a decision all the time</v>

90
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:07.030
<v Speaker 1>about exactly how you're going to treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>that child.</v>

91
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 1>One decision is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:14.761
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go to school today </v>

93
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 1>because you're not feeling well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like fair enough,</v>

94
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.980
<v Speaker 1>but do you make the same decision the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next day and do you make the same </v>

95
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.491
<v Speaker 1>decision the next day and let's imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you enable the child to avoid </v>

96
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>responsibility as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalizing on their illness.</v>

97
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Well then that's not going to be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for the child.</v>

98
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.060
<v Speaker 1>The rule within a sickly child has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

99
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to push you right to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>limit because otherwise,</v>

100
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 1>how is the person going to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they can do?</v>

101
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 1>And if they can't figure out what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do,</v>

102
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>then you're not going to be able to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>their way in the world at all.</v>

103
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>And then that gets muddied very badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not exactly sure that you want</v>

104
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>them to make their way in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

105
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're just as happy because you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>be sitting at home alone if your child </v>

106
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.431
<v Speaker 1>was there with you and maybe you'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>just as happy at some level if they </v>

107
00:06:03.431 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>never grew up at all because then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't leave.</v>

108
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.410
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's because you have a </v>

109
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.410
<v Speaker 1>terrible marriage and your lonesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

110
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's an abusive marriage and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>husband has chased away all your friends</v>

111
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>and so you don't have anything at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's because he didn't stand</v>

112
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 1>up for yourself very well apart from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that he was,</v>

113
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical and is central nature and so </v>

114
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.601
<v Speaker 1>then all those little warps and bends in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your psyche are going to manifest </v>

115
00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:28.760
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

116
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

117
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>In the background of every single one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those decisions.</v>

118
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.390
<v Speaker 1>My daughter had a lot of illnesses when </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was an adolescent and they were very</v>

119
00:06:40.391 --> 00:06:44.530
<v Speaker 1>serious and it was very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what to do about that because</v>

120
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.770
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't exactly apply normative </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>

121
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:52.771
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we always had to figure out if she </v>

122
00:06:52.771 --> 00:06:52.771
<v Speaker 1>was</v>

123
00:06:52.771 --> 00:06:57.640
<v Speaker 1>communicating her symptoms to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how seriously to take those and dancer </v>

124
00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.900
<v Speaker 1>was the least amount of serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

125
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.440
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to do and she needed to know what</v>

126
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 1>she could do in spite of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she had problems.</v>

127
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.690
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I really tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>instill in her,</v>

128
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.500
<v Speaker 1>and I think it worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you don't ever want to use it </v>

129
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>your illness as an excuse for not doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

130
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 1>not consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

131
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you might not know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not feeling well.</v>

132
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can I do?</v>

133
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>What you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

134
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes when you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling well,</v>

135
00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:31.811
<v Speaker 1>you can do more than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you can do less than you </v>

136
00:07:31.811 --> 00:07:31.811
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's obvious,</v>

137
00:07:31.811 --> 00:07:35.950
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know this little temptation flits </v>

138
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.950
<v Speaker 1>through your mind and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

139
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't really want to do what I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>today and I'm not feeling very well so I</v>

140
00:07:38.631 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 1>don't have to do it.</v>

141
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.740
<v Speaker 1>You do that 100 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you don't know how sick you are </v>

142
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.501
<v Speaker 1>anymore and then you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're in real trouble because not </v>

143
00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 1>only are you sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you actually have.</v>

144
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>You've muddied the waters and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have both problems.</v>

145
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:57.161
<v Speaker 1>That is you're actually ill and you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>betrayed yourself by using that as an </v>

146
00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:02.050
<v Speaker 1>excuse not to pursue your </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities and not.</v>

147
00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:07.051
<v Speaker 1>I think if you do both of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of those things happened to you at </v>

148
00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:10.241
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in real trouble and it's really </v>

149
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:11.180
<v Speaker 1>hard not to have that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

150
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I know gail gets enticed into believing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's the victim.</v>

151
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.080
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he's insufficient is used </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an excuse by the Fox and the and the </v>

152
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:25.040
<v Speaker 1>cat to offer him a trip to pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 1>island,</v>

153
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:30.130
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think where the movie gets </v>

154
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:30.130
<v Speaker 1>particularly dark and so off they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>singing away.</v>

155
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.410
<v Speaker 1>They have to carry them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>

156
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:38.411
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's carried by societal pathology and </v>

157
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:41.861
<v Speaker 1>his own trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's carried like a puppet off to </v>

158
00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:41.861
<v Speaker 1>pleasure island.</v>
