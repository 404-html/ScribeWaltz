1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.910
<v Speaker 1>So here you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from the wonderlic people there,</v>

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>a commercial company that makes general </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive ability tests and it's often </v>

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>used by corporations even though it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually illegal,</v>

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.990
<v Speaker 1>it's actually illegal to use Iq tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the wonderlic doesn't promote </v>

5
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:23.661
<v Speaker 1>themselves as testing Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they think it's general </v>

6
00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:23.661
<v Speaker 1>cognitive ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the same thing,</v>

7
00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>but whatever the sats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gres,</v>

8
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>the lsats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those are Iq tests.</v>

9
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>So now they're more crystallized than </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid and we'll get to that in a minute.</v>

10
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>But crystallized knowledge is what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>accrue across type.</v>

11
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>So you could say that fluid intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what programs your brain,</v>

12
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>it fills it with facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it fills it with knowledge and</v>

13
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:47.781
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can get an estimate of your </v>

14
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>intelligence by sampling your domain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>factual knowledge.</v>

15
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.890
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that while </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the better the programmer,</v>

16
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>the better the content.</v>

17
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>And so what that also means is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

18
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were prefrontal cortex was </v>

19
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>damaged later in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fluid Iq could plummet,</v>

20
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>but you're crystallized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq remain more or less intact.</v>

21
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>So even though they're not different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one produces the other and then once the</v>

22
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:14.781
<v Speaker 1>producer has produced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the producer can disappear and you </v>

23
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>still got the uncoated knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at least that's how it looks to me.</v>

24
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>So how smart do you have to be to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things in life?</v>

26
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have an Iq of 100,</v>

27
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>16 to 130,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 85th percentile and above.</v>

28
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's one person in eight up to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>person in 1:30,</v>

29
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I believe is 85,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 95.</v>

30
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Is it 95?</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 five.</v>

31
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>One person a to one person in 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can be a attorney,</v>

32
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>a research analyst and editor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising manager,</v>

33
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>a chemist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an engineer and executive manager,</v>

34
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>

35
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

36
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>that's not the high end for ICU by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

37
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>You know that it can go up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:01:56.371 --> 00:02:01.371
<v Speaker 1>it can go up indefinitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although there's fewer and fewer people </v>

39
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:04.161
<v Speaker 1>as it goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to be the best at what </v>

40
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bar none,</v>

41
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>then having an Iq of above 145 is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity.</v>

42
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:11.470
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you're pushing one 60 in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations and maybe that's me.</v>

43
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Make a new one person in 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even one person in 100,000.</v>

44
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 1>And then also to really be good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably have to be reasonably </v>

45
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>stress tolerant and also somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious.</v>

46
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 1>So people you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why is it that smart people are at </v>

47
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:31.551
<v Speaker 1>the top of dominance hierarchies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that in part is </v>

48
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:31.551
<v Speaker 1>because they get their first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

49
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything's a race roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>

50
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>And the faster you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you are to be at the </v>

51
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>forefront of the pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And intelligence in large part is speed.</v>

52
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.140
<v Speaker 1>That's not all of it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're moving towards something </v>

53
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>difficult rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the faster people are going to get there</v>

54
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Iq of 1:15,</v>

55
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>1:10</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 1:15,</v>

56
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:52.840
<v Speaker 1>so that's 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth to 73rd,</v>

57
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>85th percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Copywriter,</v>

58
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>accountant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manager,</v>

59
00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:59.010

62
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>sales account executive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at universities,</v>

63
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>the smartest people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're above this.</v>

64
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Who are the smartest people at </v>
<v Speaker 1>University?</v>

65
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

66
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Mathematicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicists,</v>

67
00:03:13.761 --> 00:03:14.840
<v Speaker 1>and mathematicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

68
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you who's on the other end,</v>

69
00:03:17.451 --> 00:03:22.040
<v Speaker 1>but I won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

70
00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

71
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Going down the wondering three to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way to slightly above average,</v>

73
00:03:29.721 --> 00:03:31.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixtieth to 70th percentile,</v>

74
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.230
<v Speaker 1>store manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bookkeeper,</v>

75
00:03:33.231 --> 00:03:34.520
<v Speaker 1>credit clerk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lab test,</v>

76
00:03:34.521 --> 00:03:36.140
<v Speaker 1>or general sales,</v>

<v Speaker 1>typist.</v>

80
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>So you see at this level people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have some technical skill and </v>

81
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.370
<v Speaker 1>some ability to deal with complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

82
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's dead.</v>

83

92
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good Iq range for relatively qualified </v>

93
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.090

<v Speaker 1>80 seven to 93 messenger,</v>

97
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.020
<v Speaker 1>material handler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>packer.</v>

98
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Now what you're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're starting to see is that as </v>

99
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>you move down the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jobs get simpler.</v>

100
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.720
<v Speaker 1>They're more likely to be assigned by </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people or the repetitive because </v>

101
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 1>what Iq predicts to some degree is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly you can learn something,</v>

102
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:45.061
<v Speaker 1>but once you've learned it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't predict how necessarily how </v>

103
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:46.800
<v Speaker 1>well you do at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the more repetitive jobs tend,</v>

104
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>people with lower iqs are more suited to</v>
<v Speaker 1>more repetitive jobs under 87.</v>

105
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Is there something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

106
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

107
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.350
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big problem and it's something </v>

108
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.381
<v Speaker 1>our society has not addressed at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jobs for people with Iqs of less than 85</v>

109
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rare.</v>

110
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell are those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do?</v>

111
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 15 percent of the population.</v>

112
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>What are they supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

113
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.060
<v Speaker 1>we better figure it out because one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that's happening too is that </v>

114
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.241
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the High Iq tech geeks get a hold of </v>

115
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:27.991
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demand for cognitive power is </v>

116
00:05:27.991 --> 00:05:27.991
<v Speaker 1>increasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not decreasing,</v>

117
00:05:27.991 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be a teller.</v>

118
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know those checkout machines,</v>

119
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 1>they're not so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to work at Mcdonald's.</v>

120
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:38.581
<v Speaker 1>You think that's a simple job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see robots working at </v>

121
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:40.981
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's and the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what Mcdonald's workers do is too </v>

122
00:05:40.981 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 1>complex for for robots to do so</v>

123
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.200
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a discussion that no one </v>

124
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.200
<v Speaker 1>wants to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

125
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.620
<v Speaker 1>It's still a problem and it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt with.</v>

126
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.860
<v Speaker 1>So the US government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you this at one point </v>

127
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.471
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's illegal to induct anyone into the </v>

128
00:06:01.471 --> 00:06:01.471
<v Speaker 1>US army if they have an Iq of less than </v>
<v Speaker 1>83,</v>

129
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about 10 percent of the population </v>

130
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.600
<v Speaker 1>because the US army and they'd be doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq testing since Iq testing began </v>

131
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.530
<v Speaker 1>because they want everybody they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly get into the army because in </v>

132
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.731
<v Speaker 1>peace time they use it as a way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving people up the socioeconomic </v>

133
00:06:18.731 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>ladder and in war time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously you need as many soldiers</v>

134
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:25.931
<v Speaker 1>as you can get your hands on and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be any pickier than </v>

135
00:06:25.931 --> 00:06:27.280
<v Speaker 1>you have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the U,</v>

136
00:06:27.281 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 1>s army says it's illegal to induct </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody into the armed forces.</v>

137
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.650
<v Speaker 1>If they have an Iq of less than 83,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know that they've done it for </v>

138
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 1>absolute necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

139
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:41.381
<v Speaker 1>And when people have made a finding that</v>
<v Speaker 1>contradicts what they want to hear and </v>

140
00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:42.590
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it out of absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity,</v>

141
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.740
<v Speaker 1>you can be reasonably true that it's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those facts that just won't bloody </v>

142
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>well go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think,</v>

143
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:52.751
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's nothing for someone with an </v>

144
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:54.791
<v Speaker 1>Iq of less than 83 to do in the army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes you think that there's </v>

145
00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 1>something that they can do in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general population?</v>

146
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.550
<v Speaker 1>And then the issue is because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Conservatives will say,</v>

147
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should just work harder.</v>

148
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

149
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 1>that ain't gonna fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the liberals will say,</v>

150
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:08.141
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between people </v>

151
00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:08.510
<v Speaker 1>anyhow and you can just train people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do everything and that's wrong.</v>

152
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 1>So they're both wrong and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously wrong.</v>

153
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that neither side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political perspective,</v>

154
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:19.451
<v Speaker 1>we'll take a good cold hard look at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem means that we're going to </v>

155
00:07:19.451 --> 00:07:23.171
<v Speaker 1>increasingly have a structural problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>in our societies because we're </v>

156
00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:26.411
<v Speaker 1>complexifying everything so rapidly that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't find employment unless </v>

157
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 1>increasingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're intelligent,</v>

158
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 1>you guys are really going to face this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

159
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:35.110
<v Speaker 1>lawyers are disappearing like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is you can look </v>

160
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 1>it up online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Increasingly.</v>

161
00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:38.570
<v Speaker 1>You can do things yourself if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>

162
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:44.050
<v Speaker 1>And so like the working class people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been wiped out pretty nicely over </v>

163
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.980
<v Speaker 1>the last 30 years by by automation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>various other things.</v>

164
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.460
<v Speaker 1>It's the low end of the white collar </v>
<v Speaker 1>class that's coming up next.</v>

165
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.010
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not saying that lawyers lawyers </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in the low end,</v>

166
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:55.820
<v Speaker 1>but low end lawyers are in the low end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the white collar class.</v>

167
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.240
<v Speaker 1>So there's still going to be plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions for people who are creative </v>

168
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 1>and fast on their feet and super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

169
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:07.151
<v Speaker 1>those people are going to have all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money that's already happening to a </v>

170
00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:07.151
<v Speaker 1>great degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 1>because if you're smart and you can use </v>
<v Speaker 1>a computer,</v>

172
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 1>you're so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just absolutely unbelievable.</v>

173
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't use a computer and lots</v>

174
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:15.950
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean,</v>

175
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:21.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can open word that isn't what I </v>

176
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.040
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe,</v>

177
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can program and if you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>program while you're right at the next </v>

178
00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:26.510
<v Speaker 1>and so if you haven't got that with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

179
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.460
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna be left behind.</v>

180
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of them will take demerol.</v>

181
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.600
<v Speaker 1>That's what's happening in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

182
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an opiate.</v>

183
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a massive drug problem </v>

184
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:44.610
<v Speaker 1>emerging and.</v>

185
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

186
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

187
00:08:47.011 --> 00:08:48.180
<v Speaker 1>that is what's happening there.</v>

188
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drugs.</v>

189
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drugs of abuse.</v>

190
00:08:59.340 --> 00:08:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

191
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 1>What is happening to a large degree is </v>
<v Speaker 1>people drop out of the employment race.</v>

192
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.240
<v Speaker 1>They get very depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They develop chronic pain problems,</v>

193
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:11.241
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because chronic pain and depression are </v>

194
00:09:11.241 --> 00:09:14.451
<v Speaker 1>very much the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they subsist on opiates which </v>

195
00:09:14.451 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 1>are subsidized by Medicaid in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding about this.</v>

196
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:17.530
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

197
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.340
<v Speaker 1>what else is going to happen to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>for whom there is nothing to do.</v>

198
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.400
<v Speaker 1>They have a terrible time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're conscientious.</v>

199
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the Ai guys are pushing hard on</v>

200
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:30.680
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

201
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.800
<v Speaker 1>what's the biggest employment category </v>
<v Speaker 1>driver?</v>

202
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's Tesla doing?</v>

203
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.410
<v Speaker 1>What are all the ai guys working on as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast as they possibly can?</v>

204
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Driverless cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

205
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Except that's the biggest employment </v>
<v Speaker 1>category for men.</v>

206
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.510
<v Speaker 1>So what are those guys going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

207
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 1>they're going to sit home and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable with their wives and take </v>

208
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 1>opiates because they have chronic pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

209
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nasty,</v>

210
00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.740
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

211
00:09:59.741 --> 00:10:01.600
<v Speaker 1>could they think of something else to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>

212
00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have an Iq of 83 or less,</v>

213
00:10:04.751 --> 00:10:07.720
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be doing a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about something else to do.</v>

214
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.900
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how it works because you're </v>

215
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:12.970
<v Speaker 1>more of a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an act person,</v>

216
00:10:12.971 --> 00:10:15.400
<v Speaker 1>not a thinking person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

217
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you have a task at hand,</v>

218
00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:20.410
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can diligently go about it,</v>

219
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:25.770
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to train people with Iqs of </v>

220
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 1>80 and less to do what I would consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>tasks that,</v>

221
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:33.280
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one of you could learn to do in 10 </v>

222
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.641
<v Speaker 1>minutes and never make a mistake again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like tens of hours with bare </v>

223
00:10:35.681 --> 00:10:40.660
<v Speaker 1>minimum mastery of the tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's ugly situation,</v>

224
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.590
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>
