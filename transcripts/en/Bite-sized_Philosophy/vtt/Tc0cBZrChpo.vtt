1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happens with with Abraham?</v>

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's at home and these angels show up.</v>

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.850
<v Speaker 1>we don't know whether they're angels or </v>
<v Speaker 1>men precisely because while as this part</v>

5
00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:20.551
<v Speaker 1>of the story reads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the Lord appeared to him in the </v>

6
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:21.550
<v Speaker 1>plains of camera and he sat in the tent </v>
<v Speaker 1>door in the heat of the day,</v>

7
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.880
<v Speaker 1>so he's another visionary state by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by all appearances,</v>

8
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>and he lifted up his eyes and looked and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lo three men stood by him.</v>

9
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>There's real ambivalence in the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the man or the three men are the </v>

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.690
<v Speaker 1>three angels are there to angels and </v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

11
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 1>It's all mixed up in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we will clarify that.</v>

12
00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:42.730
<v Speaker 1>We'll leave it ambiguous and I think the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambiguity is important because you don't</v>

13
00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:47.140
<v Speaker 1>know who the stranger is when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter them and it depends on whether</v>

14
00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about it</v>

15
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 1>in the normative manner or if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it in the transcendent </v>

16
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because with each person that you meet,</v>

17
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just a person.</v>

18
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're the person that you know or</v>

19
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:05.931
<v Speaker 1>they're the person as they choose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveal themselves to you when people </v>

20
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:10.131
<v Speaker 1>keep themselves shielded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there also something of great </v>

21
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>do you believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

24
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

25
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.930
<v Speaker 1>you believe it because you expect a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>from people generally speaking and are </v>

26
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>not happy if they betray you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>

27
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.410
<v Speaker 1>our entire culture is predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that each person has an indefinite </v>

28
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not talking about self esteem.</v>

29
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about something like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

30
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say it?</v>

31
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>The implicit presupposition in our legal</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that no matter who you are,</v>

32
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a condemned murderer,</v>

33
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.680
<v Speaker 1>that there's something about you that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>of transcendent value that has to be </v>

34
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>respected by the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the law and by other people.</v>

35
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

36
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>that's a remark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

37
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>do I believe that the answer that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

39
00:01:56.371 --> 00:02:01.371
<v Speaker 1>you act it out because you follow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law and it's not an easy thing to pull </v>

40
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:04.971
<v Speaker 1>out of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of the idea that you have </v>

41
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:06.951
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic natural rights and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull that out of our law man without </v>

42
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>having the whole thing fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the whole idea that you have</v>

43
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:14.751
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic natural rights is predicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>on something like the biblical </v>

44
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.940
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis that human beings have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a logos nature and that we are involved </v>

45
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 1>in this speaking forth of being and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings who are,</v>

46
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>who are involved in this speaking forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being.</v>

47
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>There's something about us that has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be respected by,</v>

48
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 1>by ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to ourselves,</v>

49
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>by ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to other people,</v>

50
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 1>but even more strangely by ourselves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to even to criminals,</v>

51
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>even to vicious criminals.</v>

52
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't remove that transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 1>element and that's that to me,</v>

53
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:51.861
<v Speaker 1>that's also a mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a miracle of conceptualization because </v>

54
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 1>who the hell is going to think that up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

55
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Even the most vicious of murderers has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch of the transcendent that needs to </v>

56
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>be respected of all the ideas that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely,</v>

57
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>that's going to top the list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course without that,</v>

58
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>you have a very barbaric legal system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Because no one is protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you make a mistake,</v>

60
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>then you're in the dam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have no rights whatsoever,</v>

61
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>and that isn't what happens in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an absolutely amazing thing.</v>

62
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham is a master of the stranger.</v>

63
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.980
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows what to do when strangers come </v>

64
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:32.401
<v Speaker 1>along and he opens his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He opens himself up to them and I would </v>

65
00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>say he does that.</v>

66
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>We know he's not a naive guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham,</v>

67
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's no weakling.</v>

68
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>A couple of stories ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took a big army and went and harassed</v>

69
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of kings and took his nephew </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

70
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a tough guy.</v>

71
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>And so if stranger show up and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>welcomes them,</v>

72
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not because he couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise.</v>

73
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.320
<v Speaker 1>He could certainly do otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not because he isn't aware of </v>

74
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>what people can be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's perfectly aware of what people can </v>

75
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.531
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he determines to take a particular </v>

76
00:04:04.531 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>attitude towards them and that is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome them and so and why would you do</v>

77
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:11.881
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the answer to that is you </v>

78
00:04:11.881 --> 00:04:16.110
<v Speaker 1>hold out your hand in trust to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you evoke the best from them if </v>

79
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 1>that's there to be given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an act of courage.</v>

80
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't me meeting you.</v>

81
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly.</v>

82
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:30.211
<v Speaker 1>It's more like the transcendent part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>me making a gesture that allows the </v>

83
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>transcendent part of you to step forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that happens all the time.</v>

84
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 1>It happens all the time in normative </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse.</v>

85
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:42.181
<v Speaker 1>You know this perfectly well because </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you can have a real casual </v>

86
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 1>conversation with someone that just goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere,</v>

87
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just shallow as can be or now,</v>

88
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 1>and then you can actually make contact </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone.</v>

89
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're both,</v>

90
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I would say enlightened and Ennobles by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the conversation and that's a deal.</v>

91
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.630
<v Speaker 1>We would call that a deep conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit for some reason because we made a </v>

92
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 1>deep connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that means,</v>

93
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:04.771
<v Speaker 1>it means well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly means that it's not </v>

94
00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.931
<v Speaker 1>shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were not sure about what these </v>

95
00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:06.940
<v Speaker 1>metaphor means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it means that it reaches deep inside</v>

96
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

97
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:12.901
<v Speaker 1>You make direct person to person contact</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those sorts of conversations are,</v>

98
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm replenishing that that's the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to think about it.</v>

99
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.710
<v Speaker 1>They they genuinely are and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because they provide you with </v>

100
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.551
<v Speaker 1>that bread that's not material bread and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the information that you need to </v>

101
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.340
<v Speaker 1>to thrive and to put yourself together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it does matter how you meet </v>

102
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:37.681
<v Speaker 1>someone and it doesn't matter how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat them when you first meet them and </v>

103
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:40.951
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've learned to do this at least in </v>

104
00:05:40.951 --> 00:05:43.681
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because I'm a clinical </v>

105
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:45.421
<v Speaker 1>psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've learned how to talk to people very </v>

106
00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:47.401
<v Speaker 1>rapidly and I have the most amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventures with people in cabs and when </v>

107
00:05:47.401 --> 00:05:51.571
<v Speaker 1>I travel because I'll talk to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly right away and they'll tell me </v>

108
00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:55.081
<v Speaker 1>the wildest stories and show me the </v>
<v Speaker 1>craziest things because I'm actually </v>

109
00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 1>interested in what they have to say and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not afraid.</v>

110
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm somewhat afraid,</v>

111
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.490
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sufficiently afraid to have that</v>

112
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>stopped me and I'm acting on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that</v>

113
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>the person has something of great </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest to reveal and that's a very </v>

114
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.591
<v Speaker 1>useful thing to know too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that's really </v>

115
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:18.201
<v Speaker 1>cool about people that are you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned this as a clinical psychologist </v>

116
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:18.900
<v Speaker 1>is that if you can get people talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so damn interesting.</v>

117
00:06:18.901 --> 00:06:21.270
<v Speaker 1>You can hardly stand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

118
00:06:21.271 --> 00:06:24.390
<v Speaker 1>because they have these idiosyncratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences that are only.</v>

119
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.500
<v Speaker 1>There's only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's personally no one else could </v>

120
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.610
<v Speaker 1>tell the story and that's the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories that you want to hear.</v>

121
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.580
<v Speaker 1>And when they tell you those stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn something you didn't know.</v>

122
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat the landscape of strangers as an </v>

123
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.830
<v Speaker 1>endless vista of places to learn things </v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know.</v>

124
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.970
<v Speaker 1>And if you know enough so that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfied with your life and everything </v>

125
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.560
<v Speaker 1>has ceased to be a tragedy around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you can be comfortable in your</v>

126
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.820
<v Speaker 1>circumscribed domain of totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>

127
00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:54.360
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

128
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 1>But if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your life is insufficient and you're </v>

129
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.780
<v Speaker 1>suffering more than you want to and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything isn't what it should be,</v>

130
00:07:00.781 --> 00:07:05.781
<v Speaker 1>then you need to look where you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked for what you don't have and then </v>

131
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:08.850
<v Speaker 1>you can look outside beyond you and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make friends with what you don't</v>

132
00:07:08.851 --> 00:07:13.851
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a huge part of what this </v>

133
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:17.421
<v Speaker 1>story's about because what happens is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Abraham welcomes the men,</v>

134
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.550
<v Speaker 1>God angels and treats them very well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaps a tremendous benefit as a </v>

135
00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:23.610
<v Speaker 1>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

136
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:29.150
<v Speaker 1>well then the story reverses and we end </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in Sodom and Gomorrah were the same </v>

137
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.030
<v Speaker 1>angels sojourn and they're treated </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly and all hell breaks loose,</v>

138
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what the story's about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fundamentally now there's A.</v>

139
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.100
<v Speaker 1>There's a sexual impropriety thing going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that I'm also going to delve into,</v>

140
00:07:41.101 --> 00:07:43.680
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that's the critical </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue in the story.</v>

141
00:07:43.681 --> 00:07:48.681
<v Speaker 1>The critical issue in the story is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you act in the face of the stranger?</v>

142
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.090
<v Speaker 1>You know there's a statement in the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>

143
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Christ says something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

144
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.000
<v Speaker 1>when you do something to the least of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

145
00:07:58.001 --> 00:08:02.530
<v Speaker 1>you do it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him Right,</v>

146
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:03.820
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very</v>

147
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.260
<v Speaker 1>difficult statement to understand too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's something like it's something </v>

148
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.600
<v Speaker 1>reminiscent of the requirement to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the transcendent reality of </v>

149
00:08:16.631 --> 00:08:21.631
<v Speaker 1>the person in mind at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep their proximal reality in mind </v>

150
00:08:21.631 --> 00:08:25.770
<v Speaker 1>to have to have your mind in two places </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time when you're talking to </v>

151
00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:26.260
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

152
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned from a friend of mine in </v>

153
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.141
<v Speaker 1>Montreal who's very socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated and in some ways,</v>

154
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever,</v>

155
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:44.250
<v Speaker 1>whenever he went into a star wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like going shopping with him and </v>

156
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.610
<v Speaker 1>whenever he went into a store and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked and he had an interaction with a </v>

157
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.561
<v Speaker 1>clerk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing he would do is have an </v>

158
00:08:52.561 --> 00:08:52.561
<v Speaker 1>interaction with the clerk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

159
00:08:52.561 --> 00:08:54.070
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't have any interaction with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the role of the clerk.</v>

160
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.540
<v Speaker 1>He'd like look at the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of take stock of the fact that they</v>

161
00:08:57.541 --> 00:09:02.541
<v Speaker 1>were there and then ask them something </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine about their job or their store,</v>

162
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.960
<v Speaker 1>how they were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like go into a conversation right away </v>

163
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't get personal about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that can be intrusive.</v>

164
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:15.381
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to be very sophisticated to </v>

165
00:09:15.381 --> 00:09:16.911
<v Speaker 1>do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he did indicate to the person that </v>

166
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.300
<v Speaker 1>he was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part for the good that could</v>

167
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.690
<v Speaker 1>be done between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

168
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.960
<v Speaker 1>And then the person would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously helpful,</v>

169
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

170
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 1>and so then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people mistreat you,</v>

171
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:37.490
<v Speaker 1>you see this with anti social kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very tragic thing to see because if</v>

172
00:09:37.491 --> 00:09:40.130
<v Speaker 1>you're an antisocial child by the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were above four,</v>

173
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.280
<v Speaker 1>your very hostile and distrustful to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and so you'd like a growling </v>

174
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.020
<v Speaker 1>puppy and if you're a growling puppy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend not to get petted.</v>

175
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:51.530
<v Speaker 1>You're more likely to get kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're growling puppy and you get</v>

176
00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:53.960
<v Speaker 1>kicked and you have even more reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>

177
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>antisocial kids.</v>

178
00:09:56.391 --> 00:10:01.391
<v Speaker 1>If they're not well socialized by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time they're four and they're more on </v>

179
00:10:01.391 --> 00:10:03.890
<v Speaker 1>the aggressive side than they alienate </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves from the community.</v>

180
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.980
<v Speaker 1>And all they get is rejection while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they look at the rejection and </v>

181
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.900
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well hell with humanity.</v>

182
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder they think that.</v>

183
00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:16.810
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the part of the catastrophe is,</v>

184
00:10:16.811 --> 00:10:21.811
<v Speaker 1>is that they get what they evoke and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying it's their fault </v>

185
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.330
<v Speaker 1>precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

186
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.970
<v Speaker 1>That's still what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might ask yourself,</v>

187
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.180
<v Speaker 1>if you're not getting from people what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need,</v>

188
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.750
<v Speaker 1>there is some possibility that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not approaching,</v>

189
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.450
<v Speaker 1>especially if this happens to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly across people.</v>

190
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:40.630
<v Speaker 1>And this is a virtual certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it happens to you repeatedly across </v>

191
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.021
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have the same bad </v>

192
00:10:44.021 --> 00:10:44.021
<v Speaker 1>experience with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not them,</v>

193
00:10:44.021 --> 00:10:46.610
<v Speaker 1>it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say three is the limit.</v>

194
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.830
<v Speaker 1>If something happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once</v>

195
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.690
<v Speaker 1>you write it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it happens to you twice,</v>

196
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.780
<v Speaker 1>it's like you open your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you write it off.</v>

197
00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.960
<v Speaker 1>But if it happens to you three times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably you or as the rest of the </v>

198
00:11:01.931 --> 00:11:06.931
<v Speaker 1>world better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you because you're not going to </v>

199
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:06.931
<v Speaker 1>change the rest of the world.</v>
