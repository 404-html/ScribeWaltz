1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.920
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go into places like that,</v>

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I always think of the archetypal diner </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that way.</v>

3
00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys have been in this diner,</v>

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a really good opposite diner and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a great video on youtube.</v>

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.030
<v Speaker 1>It's Tom waits reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading a poem by Makowsky and I think </v>

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.200
<v Speaker 1>it's called Nirvana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's about a good diner that,</v>

7
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.270
<v Speaker 1>that happened to visit because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to visit when he was on a bus </v>

8
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>when he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was a kid,</v>

9
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>a diner where everything was going well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could listen to that.</v>

10
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's great.</v>

11
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>But this is the opposite diner I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about.</v>

12
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>So you'll go into a diner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 1>It's 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and you order some bacon </v>

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.231
<v Speaker 1>and eggs and some toast and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look around in the diner and you think </v>

15
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>it was like 1975 when the windows were </v>
<v Speaker 1>last washed.</v>

16
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>And there's this kind of thick coating </v>
<v Speaker 1>of who gives a damn grease on the walls,</v>

17
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

18
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>and the floor to has got that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stickiness that you really have to work </v>

19
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>out to develop over years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:02.901
<v Speaker 1>and the waitress is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not happy to be there and the guy </v>

21
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:05.991
<v Speaker 1>behind the counter isn't happy that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens to be the waitress that </v>

22
00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>he's working with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

23
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you walk down the stairs maybe to the </v>

24
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.311
<v Speaker 1>washroom and now it's its own little </v>
<v Speaker 1>trip and so you come back and you order </v>

25
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:18.501
<v Speaker 1>your damn eggs and you order your toast </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the order your bacon and then it </v>

26
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 1>comes in like the eggs are too cooked on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom.</v>

27
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:27.561
<v Speaker 1>So they're kind of brown and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of raw on top and they're </v>

28
00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 1>cold in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

29
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>you really have to work their cooking </v>
<v Speaker 1>egg like that man.</v>

30
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>But you can master that with like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of bitterness.</v>

31
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>You teach you how to cook an egg like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

32
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>And then the toast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what you do with the toast,</v>

33
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put,</v>

34
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>you take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take the white bread,</v>

35
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>you know the precise stuff that no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>should ever eat and then you put that in</v>

36
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:51.261
<v Speaker 1>the toaster and you overcook it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wait and then you pop it out of the </v>

37
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:56.031
<v Speaker 1>toaster and then cause it's overcooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You scrape it off and you knock off the </v>

38
00:01:56.031 --> 00:02:00.831
<v Speaker 1>crumbs so it doesn't look too bird and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you wait till it's cold and then </v>

39
00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>you put cold margin on it because if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>put cold march,</v>

40
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not butter,</v>

41
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>but if you put cold margarine or you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>also kind of tear holes in it so then it</v>

42
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:13.431
<v Speaker 1>has lumps of margarine in it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really dry except where it's too greasy.</v>

43
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 1>So that's like it's own little work of </v>
<v Speaker 1>art man.</v>

44
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.420
<v Speaker 1>And then you put that on the side with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

45
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the eggs and then you have the </v>

46
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>potatoes and this is how you cook the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potatoes properly.</v>

47
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>So the leftover potatoes and you keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumping new leftover potatoes into the </v>

48
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>old leftover potatoes over weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so some of the potatoes,</v>

49
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:38.470
<v Speaker 1>if they're no longer potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

50
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.120
<v Speaker 1>They've have return to mother earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you flop them on the grill and you </v>

51
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:50.430
<v Speaker 1>sort of had to know you burned them a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit I guess,</v>

52
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>and then you slap them on the plate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

53
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to eat those man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

54
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:02.061
<v Speaker 1>And that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the bake and then you </v>

55
00:03:02.061 --> 00:03:04.670
<v Speaker 1>want to make sure you buy the lowest </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible quality bacon.</v>

56
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.440
<v Speaker 1>That's how I start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you throw it on the grill and </v>

57
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.221
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your grill has to be overheated to do </v>

58
00:03:14.221 --> 00:03:17.161
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to cook the Bacon so that it's </v>

59
00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:19.591
<v Speaker 1>raw and places and burnt in other places</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has that delightful like older.</v>

60
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:25.321
<v Speaker 1>They'd only really cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>badly cooked bacon can provide or maybe </v>

61
00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:29.641
<v Speaker 1>you use those little breakfast sausages </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one in their bloody right mind </v>

62
00:03:29.641 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>would let within 15 feet of anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>living,</v>

63
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.300
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you serve that right and you </v>

64
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.181
<v Speaker 1>serve it with the kind of orange juice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is only orange in color and,</v>

65
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>and with coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

66
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>What would you say it was started too </v>
<v Speaker 1>early in the morning.</v>

67
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad quality coffee started too early in </v>

68
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.921
<v Speaker 1>the morning route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God called once or twice and has been </v>

69
00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>reheated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you serve that with whitener.</v>

70
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is your breakfast.</v>

71
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>

72
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>that's not breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hell</v>

73
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

74
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.940
<v Speaker 1>and and you created it and then what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do if you have a diner like that is </v>

75
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 1>because you have a miserable life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a diner like that and you've</v>

76
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:31.861
<v Speaker 1>really worked on achieving that is every</v>
<v Speaker 1>night you go home and you curse your </v>

77
00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:35.910
<v Speaker 1>wife and you curse your kids and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking well curse God to for producing </v>

78
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:41.161
<v Speaker 1>a universe where a diner like yours is </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to exist and that's your bloody </v>

79
00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
