00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>The story in the story of Adam and Eve </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a Meta story and it's a story for two</v>

2
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:11.181
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is it's about how stories transform </v>

3
00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:15.260
<v Speaker 1>because Adam and Eve are in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious paradise and then it </v>

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>collapses and that happens to every </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential story,</v>

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's niches realization.</v>

6
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you live within a belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and then something arises to </v>

8
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.071
<v Speaker 1>challenge the belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only does the belief system </v>

9
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something worse happens.</v>

10
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Your belief in belief systems collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the road tonight.</v>

11
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Now it doesn't have to because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>jump from one belief system to another,</v>

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes that doesn't work is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do a medic critique and you say,</v>

13
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:45.051
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living in this protective </v>

14
00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:45.051
<v Speaker 1>structure and it turned out to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>flawed.</v>

15
00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One alternative is jumped to another </v>

16
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.880
<v Speaker 1>protective structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

17
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Another alternative is protective </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that themselves are not to be</v>

18
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>trusted.</v>

19
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in chaos.</v>

20
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>How the hell are you going to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

21
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>That's the pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denialism.</v>

22
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>While you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

23
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>You can work your way through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's difficult,</v>

24
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:07.851
<v Speaker 1>or you can do what young would regard as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a soul damaging move and you can </v>

25
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:12.261
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice your new knowledge and re </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with something real rigid and </v>

26
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:16.641
<v Speaker 1>restricted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I would say is happening </v>

27
00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:18.951
<v Speaker 1>to some degree with the people in or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe who are turning to a regressive </v>

28
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>nationalism as an alternative to to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>current state of chaos.</v>

29
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like I know that that people need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to identify with local groups.</v>

30
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:32.061
<v Speaker 1>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they risk the danger of making the </v>

31
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:35.911
<v Speaker 1>state the ultimate God and that's order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a good replacement for </v>

32
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just another kind of catastrophe.</v>

33
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much order.</v>

34
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Too much chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>

35
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Catastrophes.</v>

36
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.970
<v Speaker 1>You want to stand in the middle somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mediate between the two and that's </v>

37
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.721
<v Speaker 1>where you have your real strength </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then it isn't that you've </v>

38
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:53.721
<v Speaker 1>discovered a safe place because even the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody right wingers or after a safe </v>

39
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

40
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>They just want it to be the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

41
00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:02.991
<v Speaker 1>there's no safe places and the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue is do you really want a safe </v>

43
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you want?</v>

44
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>You want to be so weak that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be protected from threat.</v>

45
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.190
<v Speaker 1>What the hell kind of life is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a paralyzed rabbit in a hole </v>

46
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>that's no life for a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be confronting danger and the</v>

47
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>unknown and mlevel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because,</v>

48
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that too is this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weird paradox.</v>

49
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I believe this is the paradox,</v>

50
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was discovered in part by Buddha,</v>

51
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>but also laid forth very clearly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>

52
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:33.861
<v Speaker 1>which is that the PA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the solution to the problem of tragedy </v>

53
00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:39.891
<v Speaker 1>and malevolence is the willingness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>face the who the hell would ever guess </v>

54
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:40.050
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

55
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.050
<v Speaker 1>It's completely paradoxical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely paradoxical </v>

56
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>suggestion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

57
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does it work well?</v>

58
00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Because the more you confront the two of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

59
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:54.231
<v Speaker 1>the more you grow and maybe you can grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you're actually larger than the </v>

60
00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>chaos and malevolence itself and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

61
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the evidence for that?</v>

62
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people do.</v>

63
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 1>That is how we learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every time you expose your child to</v>

64
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a playground,</v>

65
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.080
<v Speaker 1>what are they exposed to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos and malevolence now there's more </v>

66
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>to it than that obviously because kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>play and they,</v>

67
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they promote each other and they form </v>

68
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.450
<v Speaker 1>friendships and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the playground itself,</v>

69
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.290
<v Speaker 1>there is the complexity of the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and the malevolence of the </v>

70
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.311
<v Speaker 1>bully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right there and the q throw your </v>

71
00:03:26.311 --> 00:03:26.311
<v Speaker 1>kid in there and you say adapt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they do.</v>

72
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can do it at a small scale.</v>

73
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:34.261
<v Speaker 1>It's not trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the playground is a complicated </v>

74
00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:34.261
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kid can adapt.</v>

75
00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much can you scale that up?</v>

76
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Can you scale that up to from the chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and order and malevolence of the </v>

77
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 1>playground to chaos and order and </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence itself?</v>

78
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the question.</v>

79
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any reason to </v>

80
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>answer that in the negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so because we don't know the full extent</v>

81
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>of the human being and it is the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's worked out.</v>

82
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>So in the Buddhist story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

83
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:03.631
<v Speaker 1>what happens after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Buddha's world collapses in the same </v>

84
00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:07.291
<v Speaker 1>way that Adam and Eve's world collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a consequence of repetitive </v>

85
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:09.290
<v Speaker 1>exposure to mortality and death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens to Buddha's?</v>

86
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.340
<v Speaker 1>He realizes that the little protected </v>
<v Speaker 1>city that his father made for him,</v>

87
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:19.621
<v Speaker 1>the walled garden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly the same motif that's in </v>

88
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>this Adam and Eve story is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's.</v>

89
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>It's what it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fatally flawed.</v>

90
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 1>That kind of protection cannot exist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he discovered that in pieces,</v>

91
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is exactly what happens to </v>

92
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.660
<v Speaker 1>children is that they go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they discover a limit.</v>

93
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 1>They run back and the parents can help </v>
<v Speaker 1>them with the limit.</v>

94
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.720
<v Speaker 1>They run out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they discover limit.</v>

95
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:40.660
<v Speaker 1>They run back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some at some point they run out,</v>

96
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:45.661
<v Speaker 1>they discover a limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They run back and the parents have </v>

97
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 1>nothing to say to them because they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit the same limit that the parents hit.</v>

98
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

99
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:50.040
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna do with your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to.</v>

100
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to operate in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetipal universe?</v>

101
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>While your parents can only say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

102
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>they can say you identify with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper archetypal figures they do that.</v>

103
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:03.661
<v Speaker 1>They at least act that out for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at some point it's a problem that </v>

104
00:05:03.661 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 1>they cannot solve for you without making</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weaker.</v>

105
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:12.481
<v Speaker 1>so it's an interesting thing that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned in therapy because one of the </v>

107
00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:16.591
<v Speaker 1>things you have to learn as a therapist </v>
<v Speaker 1>is how do you not take your client's </v>

108
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:21.601
<v Speaker 1>problems home with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so very common existential problem that </v>

109
00:05:21.601 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 1>beginning therapists face because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid.</v>

110
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:29.131
<v Speaker 1>It's like while you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people all the time who have serious </v>

111
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:29.131
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's mental illness,</v>

112
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:33.930
<v Speaker 1>although less frequently than you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it's just that they're </v>

113
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.021
<v Speaker 1>having a good catastrophe right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their parents have cancer or something </v>

114
00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:41.431
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or their father has Alzheimer's and </v>

115
00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:43.081
<v Speaker 1>they're unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a drug problem or they have a </v>

116
00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia zonar like these aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illness problems,</v>

117
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are just catastrophes.</v>

118
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.600
<v Speaker 1>And so people are discussing those with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you all the time.</v>

119
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>How do you avoid being crushed by that </v>
<v Speaker 1>or avoid taking it home?</v>

120
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>steal the problem that that's the </v>

121
00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.140
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

122
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have some problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you come and talk to me,</v>

123
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 1>I'll help you figure out how to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

124
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I will not tell you how to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't steal your problems because what</v>

125
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to do in therapy is number </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

126
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 1>so your problem number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn you into a great solver of problems</v>

127
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>and the second one is way more important</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the first one,</v>

128
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.740
<v Speaker 1>and so you never solve someone's problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>by removing from them the opportunity to</v>

129
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>solve their problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's theft.</v>

130
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the eatables situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the eatables situation.</v>

131
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the over protective mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No father can play that role too.</v>

132
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about architectural </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations.</v>

133
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like all protect you at the cost of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ability to protect yourself.</v>

134
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.970
<v Speaker 1>No wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that.</v>

135
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

136
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>That is not what you do with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not with your children,</v>

137
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 1>not with your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not with yourself.</v>

138
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.030
<v Speaker 1>You don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That destroys people's adaptive </v>

139
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.121
<v Speaker 1>competence and it and it disarms them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the face of chaos and malevolence and </v>

140
00:06:58.341 --> 00:06:59.610
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 1>send someone out are unarmed in a world </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

142
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrible thing to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if people aren't strong enough to </v>

143
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.981
<v Speaker 1>manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they get resentful and then when </v>

144
00:07:11.981 --> 00:07:11.981
<v Speaker 1>you get the downhill spiral that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with that.</v>

145
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the Med is story is partly you're in </v>

146
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:17.770
<v Speaker 1>a mat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

147
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.180
<v Speaker 1>you have a map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's insufficient and things will </v>

148
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.431
<v Speaker 1>come up to disrupt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes the disruption is </v>

149
00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:24.560
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything falls apart.</v>

150
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to the Buddha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens to Adam and eve </v>

151
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.950
<v Speaker 1>and the rest of the biblical stories are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually an attempt to put that back </v>

152
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.760
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that that's been assembled,</v>

153
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:37.370
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been assembled over centuries.</v>

154
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

155
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:41.600
<v Speaker 1>We've got the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is the apocalypse,</v>

156
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.350
<v Speaker 1>the ever present reality of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalyptic fall,</v>

157
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say,</v>

158
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:52.511
<v Speaker 1>well what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the insufficiency of all potential </v>

159
00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:52.730
<v Speaker 1>conceptual schemes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

160
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Your conceptual schemes are insufficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with the complexity of the </v>

161
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:57.940
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a permanent problem.</v>

162
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:03.130
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stop relying on your conceptual </v>

163
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:03.130
<v Speaker 1>schemes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the answer.</v>

164
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.110
<v Speaker 1>You start relying on your instead on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ability to actively generate </v>

165
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:13.061
<v Speaker 1>conceptual schemes in the face of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And malevolence and so that makes you </v>

166
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>someone that identifies with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative capacity,</v>

167
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 1>your creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous capacity for articulation and</v>

168
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:26.291
<v Speaker 1>action in the face of the unknown rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than some formulaic approach to the </v>

169
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:30.641
<v Speaker 1>territory and that is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that the idea is that that elevates </v>

170
00:08:30.641 --> 00:08:34.991
<v Speaker 1>your character to the point where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can withstand tragedy and malevolence </v>

171
00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:38.681
<v Speaker 1>without becoming corrupt and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>provides a permanent solution to the </v>

172
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:38.681
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

173
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Well then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cynically,</v>

174
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.360
<v Speaker 1>what's your evidence that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanent solution and answer that is </v>

175
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.740
<v Speaker 1>while the evidence isn't all in yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

176
00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:53.741
<v Speaker 1>because people only live that way </v>
<v Speaker 1>partially and so we haven't put the </v>

177
00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:58.061
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis to the full test and second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what our limitations are.</v>

178
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.130
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea what our limitations are</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>

179
00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 1>they're both greater and lesser than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined because you know,</v>

180
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:09.831
<v Speaker 1>you have to ask yourself like if people </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped adding voluntarily to the misery</v>

181
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 1>of the world and devoted themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting things straight,</v>

182
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>setting themselves straight and setting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things around them straight,</v>

183
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 1>what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

184
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'd be a hell of a lot less </v>

185
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.321
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary misery in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that might not be a bad place to </v>

186
00:09:27.321 --> 00:09:27.321
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But apart from that,</v>

187
00:09:27.321 --> 00:09:32.301
<v Speaker 1>there's very little that we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could we overcome the catastrophe of </v>

188
00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:32.301
<v Speaker 1>mortality?</v>

189
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that's beyond our capacity?</v>

190
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Could we make the world a place where no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one was suffering any more than </v>

191
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.730
<v Speaker 1>necessary and still allow the world to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist?</v>

192
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly because we don't know the </v>

193
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.101
<v Speaker 1>limitations of our capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're only running at 40 percent if </v>

194
00:09:49.101 --> 00:09:51.120
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say if we don't make full use of</v>

195
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:56.121
<v Speaker 1>all the people that are in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have our situation set up so </v>

196
00:09:56.121 --> 00:10:00.231
<v Speaker 1>that the gifts that they could offer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone are fully realized.</v>

197
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>We haven't set the systems up for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

198
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 1>So we waste people like mad and then we </v>
<v Speaker 1>waste ourselves like mad.</v>
