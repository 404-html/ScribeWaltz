00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Speaker 1>What role do women play in relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>to men or first they make themselves </v>

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>conscious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's not ever forget about that because</v>

3
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:11.391
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the primary role that women </v>

4
00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:13.761
<v Speaker 1>have in relationship to men is to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>them self conscious and men don't </v>

5
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:17.031
<v Speaker 1>precisely like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that will make a man </v>

6
00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>more self conscious than being rejected </v>
<v Speaker 1>and why?</v>

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Because why is he rejected?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will obviously mother nature in the </v>

8
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>guise of that particular woman has said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not so bad for a friend,</v>

9
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:31.641
<v Speaker 1>but there's no reason that your genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>material should propagate itself into </v>

10
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:31.641
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

11
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>and it's not like men are exactly happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>about being made,</v>

13
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>but made self conscious by women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

14
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:46.221
<v Speaker 1>It's a major source of continual tension</v>
<v Speaker 1>between men and women and it's no </v>

15
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:49.701
<v Speaker 1>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the case and this is </v>

16
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:49.701
<v Speaker 1>something really cool and interesting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

17
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:50.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do.</v>

18
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>You've divulged dive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>divulged,</v>

19
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

20
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.320
<v Speaker 1>That's it diverged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We diverged from the common ancestor </v>

21
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>between us and chimpanzees about 6 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years ago.</v>

22
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least in part,</v>

23
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee females are non discriminant </v>
<v Speaker 1>maters.</v>

24
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>They'll meet with any mail when they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>into heat,</v>

25
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>which human females don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they go into heat,</v>

26
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.190
<v Speaker 1>then any male is allowed access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the dominant males chased the </v>

27
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.721
<v Speaker 1>subordinate males away and so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant males are more likely to leave </v>

28
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:26.781
<v Speaker 1>offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not because of the female </v>

29
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:26.781
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the case with human beings.</v>

30
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Human females engage in hyperthermia and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperthermia is the,</v>

31
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>and this is also true cross culturally </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also quite.</v>

32
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>It's just as extensive in Scandinavia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite a bit of attenuation,</v>

33
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>but not much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women mate across and up.</v>

34
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Dominance hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manmade across and down.</v>

35
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that has to be the case because if </v>

36
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>obviously it has to work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If one goes up,</v>

37
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:52.791
<v Speaker 1>the other has to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The socioeconomic status of a woman is </v>

38
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>almost determined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost zero of her attractiveness </v>

39
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.011
<v Speaker 1>towards a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the socioeconomic status of a </v>

40
00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:03.711
<v Speaker 1>man is a major determinant of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness towards a woman and it </v>

41
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>isn't as well either because that's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>tested.</v>

42
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:09.321
<v Speaker 1>It's his capacity to generate and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive and to share because that </v>

43
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>beats the hell out of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wealth can disappeared,</v>

44
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:16.851
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the capacity to be productive and </v>

45
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:16.851
<v Speaker 1>share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

46
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a much more important element and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not be chosen on the basis of that,</v>

47
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:24.651
<v Speaker 1>especially because women have to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>infants and infants make the women </v>

48
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>dependent and the woman is just looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>logically,</v>

49
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.130
<v Speaker 1>rationally and from an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective for someone who is useful </v>

50
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.731
<v Speaker 1>enough to give a hint to lend a hat so </v>
<v Speaker 1>women make intense demands on men and </v>

51
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:39.861
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is is that because women </v>

52
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>engaged in hyperglycemia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>

53
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.410
<v Speaker 1>we diverge quite rapidly from </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees because the selection </v>

54
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>pressure that women placed on men </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed the entire species.</v>

55
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Now there's two things that happened as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I could tell.</v>

56
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>The men competed for competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

57
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.040
<v Speaker 1>So the male hierarchy is a mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 1>that pushes the best man to the top </v>

58
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.541
<v Speaker 1>virtually by definition and then that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the effect of that is multiplied </v>

59
00:03:02.541 --> 00:03:07.291
<v Speaker 1>by the fact that women who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgiveness peel from the top and so </v>

60
00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:10.501
<v Speaker 1>that the males who are the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>competent are much more likely to leave </v>

61
00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:14.580
<v Speaker 1>offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seemed to be what drove our </v>

62
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.580
<v Speaker 1>cortical expansion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

63
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.271
<v Speaker 1>which happened very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly over the course of </v>

64
00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:18.271
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary time.</v>
