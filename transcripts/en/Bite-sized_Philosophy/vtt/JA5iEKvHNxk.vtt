00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.070
<v Speaker 1>What kind of relationship do you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your father,</v>

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.710
<v Speaker 1>your real father?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So often ambivalent,</v>

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the earth,</v>

4
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.890
<v Speaker 1>there's an element of him that </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraged you,</v>

5
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.010
<v Speaker 1>hopefully because without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouragement of your father,</v>

6
00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:14.080
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is at dismal place.</v>

7
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to be a courageous </v>
<v Speaker 1>person unless you have your father in </v>

8
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.730
<v Speaker 1>body and spirit behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very dear,</v>

9
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 1>demoralizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it really kills people not to have </v>

10
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.400
<v Speaker 1>their mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't recover from that,</v>

11
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>but and I think people can recover from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fragmented father relationship,</v>

12
00:00:33.341 --> 00:00:38.341
<v Speaker 1>but it's the next worst thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if your father rejects you or </v>

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.480
<v Speaker 1>doesn't form a relationship with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>

14
00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:45.481
<v Speaker 1>if the spirit of civilization has left </v>
<v Speaker 1>you outside the walls as of little </v>

15
00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:51.121
<v Speaker 1>worth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for people to </v>

16
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:53.191
<v Speaker 1>recover from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the father should be an encouraging </v>

17
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 1>forest but can be a tyrannical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crushing for us.</v>

18
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:58.921
<v Speaker 1>And so that's very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very difficult thing to get </v>

19
00:00:58.921 --> 00:00:58.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly because</v>

20
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>if you're my son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I should impose the highest </v>

21
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.851
<v Speaker 1>standards of behavior on you and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>should always be judging what you're </v>

22
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:10.720
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should it be judging it with,</v>

23
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>with the aim of making the best in you </v>
<v Speaker 1>come forward,</v>

24
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but getting that balance exactly right </v>

25
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.561
<v Speaker 1>is very difficult and so it's easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a father to swing too much into </v>

26
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

27
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.660
<v Speaker 1>And then of course mothers can play this</v>
<v Speaker 1>role to,</v>

28
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>to swing too far into the domain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment and to be too harsh and to the </v>

29
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.650
<v Speaker 1>degree that the father has his own path </v>
<v Speaker 1>ologies,</v>

30
00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:34.570
<v Speaker 1>he's going to do that in perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

31
00:01:34.571 --> 00:01:39.571
<v Speaker 1>he might be someone who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the father who devours his son </v>

32
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:42.040
<v Speaker 1>because he's jealous of the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility,</v>

33
00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:44.710
<v Speaker 1>that new potential that the struggle </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

34
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 1>attention and love from the mother or </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the other children in the family.</v>

36
00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:51.280
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of things that can go </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly wrong.</v>

37
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.360
<v Speaker 1>So that's the farther as wise king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another symbol that's been </v>

38
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.321
<v Speaker 1>lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say to a massive degree in </v>

39
00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:04.661
<v Speaker 1>modern universities because all we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught is to tear that down and to not </v>

40
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>even notice that it manifests itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

41
00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:12.551
<v Speaker 1>Especially in the universities which are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there is close to an ideal </v>

42
00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:16.151
<v Speaker 1>environment as you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as human beings have ever been able to </v>

43
00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:18.881
<v Speaker 1>create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that and if you can't </v>

44
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:19.790
<v Speaker 1>be grateful for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the structure of the university with</v>

45
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:24.791
<v Speaker 1>all its imperfections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then then you're completely blind to </v>

46
00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:24.791
<v Speaker 1>this element of the archetypes</v>

47
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.510
<v Speaker 1>and that's the opposite of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the sun that devours the king,</v>

48
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:32.270
<v Speaker 1>that devours his own son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tyrant.</v>

49
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the mother who too over </v>

50
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.631
<v Speaker 1>protective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the male version of that and the </v>

51
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 1>mother that's too over protective says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never let anything happen to you.</v>

52
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

53
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:44.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe you actually want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>something happen to you.</v>

54
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit of an all inclusive </v>

55
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.510
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

56
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.990
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make you strong so any </v>

57
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:52.990
<v Speaker 1>number of things can happen to you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

58
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.040
<v Speaker 1>when you need some care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be there.</v>

59
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 1>But otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like out into the world with you,</v>

60
00:02:57.261 --> 00:02:59.120
<v Speaker 1>that's the right attitude for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

61
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Like get bloody act together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm on your side.</v>

62
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>It's because not because I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy you or demeaning you or push you</v>

63
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:09.080
<v Speaker 1>down in the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because I want the best,</v>

64
00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>didn't you to emerge and so are you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards.</v>

65
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing wasting your life?</v>

66
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>There's way more than that to you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>your act together and bring it out.</v>

67
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's a message that people really </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to hear if they have any sense at </v>

68
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.880
<v Speaker 1>all and generally they do want to hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

69
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.780
<v Speaker 1>I was talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking to a lot of people </v>

71
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.780
<v Speaker 1>recently as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as perhaps you know,</v>

72
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.861
<v Speaker 1>and what I was talking to one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders of the Conservatives this </v>

73
00:03:36.861 --> 00:03:39.950
<v Speaker 1>morning and they're asking me about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who's asking me about bill see </v>

74
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more specifically about talking to </v>

75
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.601
<v Speaker 1>young people in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the conservative leadership </v>

76
00:03:47.601 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>struggle is going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking to a bunch of them and</v>

77
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

78
00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:53.280
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you could do for young</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that no one's doing is to talk to</v>

79
00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:58.281
<v Speaker 1>them about responsibility because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone talks to young people about </v>

80
00:03:58.281 --> 00:03:58.281
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

81
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.180
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need our rights.</v>

82
00:04:00.181 --> 00:04:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

83
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.600
<v Speaker 1>how many rights do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

84
00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:08.601
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have more privileges than any </v>

85
00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:08.670
<v Speaker 1>people who've ever lived anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

86
00:04:08.671 --> 00:04:12.030
<v Speaker 1>it's so dull to hear that so dull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so pathetic.</v>

87
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:13.260
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

88
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.530
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so demeaning that you have to be </v>

89
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.230
<v Speaker 1>protected and have your rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I said,</v>

90
00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:21.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge marketplace for </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

91
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:23.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to talk to young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people about.</v>

92
00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:27.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like get your act together and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something worthwhile with your life.</v>

93
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.270
<v Speaker 1>For the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my entire adult life,</v>

94
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:33.120
<v Speaker 1>the conservatives actually have </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to sell young people,</v>

95
00:04:33.121 --> 00:04:35.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could sell them responsibility.</v>

96
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

97
00:04:36.631 --> 00:04:38.880
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's where my life has meaning</v>

98
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:42.600
<v Speaker 1>with responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more responsibility you take on,</v>

99
00:04:42.601 --> 00:04:47.601
<v Speaker 1>the more meaning your life has and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the higher degree of responsibility that</v>

100
00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:52.791
<v Speaker 1>you agreed voluntarily to try to bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the richer your life will be.</v>

101
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.950
<v Speaker 1>And no one's ever told that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the case,</v>

102
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you have,</v>

103
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.490
<v Speaker 1>you have four kids say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

104
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:02.430
<v Speaker 1>that's plenty of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have meaning.</v>

105
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.170
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.200
<v Speaker 1>because it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a complicated job and you try </v>

107
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.200
<v Speaker 1>to help the careers of the people well </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>

108
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you try to solve tough problems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>aimed suffering and do all of that.</v>

109
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:17.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like its weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its responsive stability,</v>

110
00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:18.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's glory in it.</v>

111
00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:21.540
<v Speaker 1>There's real glory in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's deep meaning in it and,</v>

112
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.980
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and young people are starving for that </v>

113
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.021
<v Speaker 1>because no one ever tells them that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're way more than you </v>

114
00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:30.021
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

115
00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:31.470
<v Speaker 1>stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do something difficult.</v>

116
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Doing something difficult and heroic,</v>
