1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.130
<v Speaker 1>The best way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best way to teach people critical </v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.441
<v Speaker 1>thinking is to teach them to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I made this little thing that I put </v>

3
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:07.540
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if maybe it is it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psych for 34 website.</v>

5
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Did I post that rubric for Essay </v>
<v Speaker 1>Writing?</v>

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 2>It is still on.</v>

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Is it not on for 34.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that not working</v>

8
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 2>when you were doing?</v>

9
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

10
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

11
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

12
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Well there's an essay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

13
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 1>that's too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not on the site for 34 website even</v>

14
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>because I updated it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this guide to writing this.</v>

15
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.870
<v Speaker 1>If it isn't on the 4:34</v>
<v Speaker 1>website,</v>

16
00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:43.871
<v Speaker 1>it is definitely on the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>website and it steps people through the </v>

17
00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:46.610
<v Speaker 1>process of writing because what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened now,</v>

18
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:49.820
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to teach people to write </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's unbelievably time intensive</v>

19
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.960
<v Speaker 1>and like writing marketing a good essay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really easy.</v>

20
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Check a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did everything right,</v>

21
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.430
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marketing a bad essay.</v>

22
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The words are wrong.</v>

23
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 1>The phrases are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sentence is wrong.</v>

24
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.650
<v Speaker 1>They're not ordered right in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>paragraphs.</v>

25
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 1>The paragraphs aren't coherent and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing makes no sense,</v>

26
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.010
<v Speaker 1>so trying to tell the person what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>did wrong.</v>

27
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:10.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

28
00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:13.340
<v Speaker 1>you did everything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything about this essay is wrong.</v>

29
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not helpful either.</v>

30
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>You have to find the few little things </v>
<v Speaker 1>they did half right and you have to </v>

31
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:25.841
<v Speaker 1>teach them what they did wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really expensive and so what I did </v>

32
00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>with this rubric was trying to address </v>
<v Speaker 1>that from the production side instead of</v>

33
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:34.991
<v Speaker 1>the grading side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the best thing you can do is teach </v>

34
00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>people to write because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between that and thinking and</v>

35
00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:41.261
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that just blows me </v>
<v Speaker 1>away about universities is that no one </v>

36
00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 1>ever tell students why they should write</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

37
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 1>you have to do this assignment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:48.050
<v Speaker 1>why are you writing well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need the grade.</v>

40
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

41
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.760
<v Speaker 1>you need to learn to think because </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking makes you act effectively in </v>

42
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.591
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking makes you win the battles you </v>

43
00:01:59.591 --> 00:01:59.591
<v Speaker 1>undertake and those could be battles for</v>
<v Speaker 1>good things.</v>

44
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:03.860
<v Speaker 1>If you can think and speak and write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are absolutely deadly.</v>

45
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can get in your way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's why you learn to write.</v>

46
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like when I can't believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people aren't just told that it's,</v>

47
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's the most powerful weapon </v>

48
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you could possibly provide someone with </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>

49
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:23.420
<v Speaker 1>I know lots of people who've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>staggeringly successful and watched them</v>

50
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:25.400
<v Speaker 1>throughout my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those people,</v>

51
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to have an argument with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

52
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.100
<v Speaker 1>They'll just slash you into pieces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not in a malevolent way.</v>

53
00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:36.101
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're gonna make your </v>
<v Speaker 1>point and they're going to make their </v>

54
00:02:36.101 --> 00:02:38.921
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better have your points organized </v>

55
00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:41.890
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you are going to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like and be an absolute idiot.</v>

56
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.170
<v Speaker 1>You are not going to get anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can formulate your arguments </v>

57
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.520
<v Speaker 1>coherently and make a presentation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can speak to people,</v>

58
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.190
<v Speaker 1>if you can lay out a proposal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

59
00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:54.650
<v Speaker 1>people give you money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you opportunities,</v>

60
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.090
<v Speaker 1>you have influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're at university for.</v>

61
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.820
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you do is you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>your urine English,</v>

62
00:03:01.821 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in your new languages anyway.</v>

63
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

64
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.800
<v Speaker 1>teach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach people to be articulate because </v>

65
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>that's the most dangerous thing you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly be.</v>

66
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's motivating.</v>

67
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>If people know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

68
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you learning to write?</v>

69
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Because your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's your sword,</v>

70
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>here's your m 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Here's your bulletproof vest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you learn how to use them,</v>

72
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.120
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>

73
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>it's an endless mystery to me why that </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't made self evident.</v>

74
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.320
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

75
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.280
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of thing that can drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>you mad.</v>

76
00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Trying to sort out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people are,</v>

77
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.190
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a conspiracy to bring people </v>

78
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.190
<v Speaker 1>into the education system to make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>weaker.</v>

79
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:50.330
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

80
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I guess that keeps the competition down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's one way of thinking about </v>

81
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.240
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your students are stupid,</v>

82
00:03:59.241 --> 00:04:00.410
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to challenge you.</v>
