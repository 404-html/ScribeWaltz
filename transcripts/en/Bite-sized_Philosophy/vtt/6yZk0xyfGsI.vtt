1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>I've been struggling with an idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently that I was thinking maybe you'd</v>

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:08.481
<v Speaker 1>be able to help me out with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically in a recent interview you </v>

3
00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:12.291
<v Speaker 1>talked about how myth is meant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconcile inherent contradictions in </v>

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>But I'm sort of stuck between two </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological or,</v>

6
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:23.631
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic ideas that I think are </v>

7
00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:26.360
<v Speaker 1>both really important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they seem to have a inherent </v>

8
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>contradiction within them that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out.</v>

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.030
<v Speaker 1>So on one hand you have this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's times in your life where you </v>

10
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.901
<v Speaker 1>have to identify things in yourself that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are insufficient or there's a problem </v>

11
00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:40.220
<v Speaker 1>somehow that you have to kind of have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled burn or like a phoenix like </v>

12
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:45.531
<v Speaker 1>transformation where you discard part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself that doesn't fit or it's not </v>

13
00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then on the other hand,</v>

14
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 1>you have talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this union idea where as you become </v>

15
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get older,</v>

16
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>you mature by reincorporating.</v>

17
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Things about yourself that you lost when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were younger or that you know you're</v>

18
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:06.261
<v Speaker 1>trying to integrate your shadow or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to find parts of your </v>

19
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>personality that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe you've been rejecting and try</v>

20
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.790
<v Speaker 1>and figure out how to bring them into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the folder and the whole.</v>

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.760
<v Speaker 1>So he's got this quote that I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

22
00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>which is I'd rather be holding good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

23
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

24
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:22.011
<v Speaker 1>so on one hand you may identify </v>
<v Speaker 1>something as a problem and you want to </v>

25
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:24.990
<v Speaker 1>get rid of it or burn it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then on the other hand it seems like</v>

26
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:29.991
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the path to being stronger is to figure </v>

27
00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>out how to put everything together.</v>

28
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 2>So there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>

29
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you wrote about in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>works on Alchemy was an explanation of </v>

30
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 2>the prime l chemical dictum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was solvay Coagula,</v>

31
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.560
<v Speaker 2>which meant dissolve and integrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

32
00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:49.180
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine this,</v>

33
00:01:49.181 --> 00:01:54.181
<v Speaker 2>imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you had a fairly hostile father </v>

34
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:57.220
<v Speaker 2>who was not very well controlled and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression,</v>

35
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.010
<v Speaker 2>decent person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that.</v>

36
00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 2>But let's say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so your reaction is,</v>

37
00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:07.651
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to be aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you've built a like a moral </v>

38
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:12.171
<v Speaker 2>structure that's part of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality and there's possibility </v>

39
00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:14.710
<v Speaker 2>floating around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Outside of that,</v>

40
00:02:14.711 --> 00:02:17.070
<v Speaker 2>did you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've denied an ethical,</v>

41
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 2>you've denied any ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you say?</v>

42
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 2>You've stripped the idea of aggression </v>
<v Speaker 2>of any ethical utility whatsoever.</v>

43
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what happens?</v>

44
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 2>This burns off and then that comes back </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

45
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:36.081
<v Speaker 2>Now you still have to integrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's associated in some sense with </v>

46
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 2>niches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

47
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 2>morality as cowardice.</v>

48
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.090
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the niches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most trenchant critiques of traditional </v>

49
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 2>morality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

50
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 2>is that most of what passes for morality</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't reality.</v>

51
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 2>It's just cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that I'm a good person and I </v>

52
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.651
<v Speaker 2>don't hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that I'm afraid to hurt you and </v>

53
00:02:57.651 --> 00:02:58.130
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to admit that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid to hurt you.</v>

54
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Then I say I'm moral because then I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>mask my essential fear and cowardice in </v>

55
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 2>a guise of morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that happens far more often than you</v>

56
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 2>would think because harmless and moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>are by no means the same thing.</v>

57
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 2>So some of what you're burning off you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can sit,</v>

58
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 2>and this is where freud was such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>genius,</v>

59
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I think is because he concentrated on </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression and sexuality,</v>

60
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:25.111
<v Speaker 2>which are perhaps the two most difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of a personality to integrate so </v>

61
00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:25.880
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

62
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hyper simplified morality stops you </v>

63
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 2>from tapping into deeper recesses of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your psyche.</v>

64
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 2>And it's partly because they are primal </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces.</v>

65
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not surprising that you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have anything to do with them,</v>

66
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 2>that you stay away from situations where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might make themselves manifest.</v>

67
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:54.751
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is by denying the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>in yourself in that manner of </v>

68
00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 2>suppressing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you preclude the possibility of the best</v>

69
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.430
<v Speaker 2>because no one can be a good person </v>
<v Speaker 2>without integrating their capacity for </v>

70
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.461
<v Speaker 2>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because without that capacity for </v>

71
00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:08.780
<v Speaker 2>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot say no because no means if </v>

72
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.411
<v Speaker 2>you really say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no means there isn't anything that you </v>

73
00:04:13.411 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 2>can do to me that will make me change my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind or,</v>

74
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.860
<v Speaker 2>or conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means I will play for higher stakes </v>

75
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.131
<v Speaker 2>than you will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And unless you've got your aggression </v>

76
00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 2>integrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't a chance you can say that.</v>

77
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:30.751
<v Speaker 2>And if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one would take you seriously because </v>

78
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:30.751
<v Speaker 2>they'd know it was just a show.</v>

79
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 2>So one of the most useful things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you did,</v>

80
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 2>I think was to work on this idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>integration of the shadow because he was</v>

81
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 2>really interested in the idea of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

82
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:44.461
<v Speaker 2>Especially working with trying to parcel</v>
<v Speaker 2>out what happened in Nazi Germany during</v>

83
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:49.621
<v Speaker 2>the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with the part of you </v>

84
00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:49.621
<v Speaker 2>that's aggressive and potentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolent?</v>

85
00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:54.600
<v Speaker 2>He just crush it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the super ego response in some </v>

86
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.600
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you just put it behind you,</v>

87
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 2>so to speak?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a possibility or do you admit to</v>

88
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 2>its existence and bring it into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game?</v>

89
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 2>And that's C for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Freud,</v>

90
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:09.421
<v Speaker 2>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>morality was super ego clamping down on </v>

91
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 2>the bed and there were fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed.</v>

92
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Both human piaget had a different idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think they were right.</v>

93
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:15.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

94
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:18.490
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you invite the bad guys out to play,</v>

95
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 2>and so you're an aggressive hockey </v>
<v Speaker 2>player,</v>

96
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's disciplined aggression that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you,</v>

97
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 2>gives you access to the whole sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy you wouldn't otherwise have.</v>

98
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 2>And then with regards to sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

99
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 2>well untrammeled promiscuity doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitute a virtue,</v>

100
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 2>but neither does unavoidable virginity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

101
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.700
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's worse because it also </v>

102
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 2>masks itself with virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

103
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:49.720
<v Speaker 2>well you should be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to do things that you</v>

104
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

105
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.330
<v Speaker 2>that's like the definition of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuinely moral person.</v>

106
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 2>They could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>

107
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 2>That's not cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

108
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 2>you burn off the things that get in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of that integration.</v>

109
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.820
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

110
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>when you say dissolve and integrating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

111
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a good way to sort of bring the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two ideas together that the burning off </v>

112
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.311
<v Speaker 1>and the difficult processes necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the elements of yourself are </v>

113
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:22.600
<v Speaker 1>structured together in a rigid way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not working properly.</v>

114
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens to Japan in the </v>

115
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.541
<v Speaker 2>belly of the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so caught in his presuppositions </v>

116
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:30.340
<v Speaker 2>that he can't escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

117
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.350
<v Speaker 2>And so Pinocchio represents the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>forest.</v>

118
00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:34.770
<v Speaker 2>So it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when You Watch Pinocchio,</v>

119
00:06:34.771 --> 00:06:39.771
<v Speaker 2>tried to rescue him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing Joe Petta does is </v>

120
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Confuse Pinocchio with a fish because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants something to eat.</v>

121
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.770
<v Speaker 2>But Pinocchio is better than something </v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat because he could rescue him so he</v>

122
00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:48.771
<v Speaker 2>doesn't need to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Pinocchio wants to make a fire </v>

123
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:50.100
<v Speaker 2>engine pedo objects because he's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to burn up all the furniture.</v>

124
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.520
<v Speaker 2>So like we don't need the damn furniture</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're getting out of the whale,</v>

125
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

126
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.120
<v Speaker 2>so Japan and he's old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

127
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.850
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

128
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 2>that's the rigid structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the old gear that has to die off </v>

129
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.291
<v Speaker 2>before the new year can be born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a forest fire that allows for new </v>

130
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 2>growth and that's how those things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>put together and to see.</v>

131
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.580
<v Speaker 2>And it's useful to know too because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you burn something off,</v>

132
00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:13.290
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's nothing left.</v>

133
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

134
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 2>If it's dead wood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have room for new growth and </v>

135
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 2>you want to be doing that on a fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular basis.</v>

136
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:22.560
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

137
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.270
<v Speaker 2>that's the snake that sheds its skin and</v>
<v Speaker 2>transforms itself.</v>

138
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

139
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Speaker 2>that's the death and resurrection from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological perspective,</v>

140
00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:35.921
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we don't know the upper limit to </v>

141
00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:35.921
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

142
00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:39.731
<v Speaker 2>Because we don't know what a person </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be like if they let everything </v>

143
00:07:39.731 --> 00:07:42.880
<v Speaker 2>that they could let go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let go and only let in what was </v>

144
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.820
<v Speaker 2>seemingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

145
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.280
<v Speaker 2>but you can see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>

146
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.850
<v Speaker 2>We don't know that to some degree you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can see people very far.</v>

147
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.240
<v Speaker 2>You can see people start to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>without.</v>

148
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.940
<v Speaker 2>That's not an rare experience and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>improve very rapidly.</v>

149
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.120
<v Speaker 2>It can improve their lives very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it's low hanging fruit,</v>

150
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:08.650
<v Speaker 2>like if you just stopped doing really </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid things that you know are stupid,</v>

151
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:12.940
<v Speaker 2>your life improves a lot so and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it frees you up.</v>

152
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.180
<v Speaker 2>It also means there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an element there that's also </v>

153
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.761
<v Speaker 2>associated with pride because people </v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to take pride in who they are and </v>

154
00:08:20.761 --> 00:08:25.691
<v Speaker 2>that's a bad idea because that stops you</v>
<v Speaker 2>from becoming who you could be because </v>

155
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:30.971
<v Speaker 2>if you're proud of who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't let that go when it's </v>

156
00:08:30.971 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't step away from it,</v>

157
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you end up being your own </v>

158
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:36.600
<v Speaker 2>parody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

159
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 2>That's also a very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be continually stepping away</v>

160
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:42.060
<v Speaker 2>from your previous self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

161
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.740
<v Speaker 2>and I guess part of that too is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to decide,</v>

162
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:46.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you,</v>

163
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:52.150
<v Speaker 2>are you order or chaos or you the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process that mediates between them and </v>

164
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 2>if you're the process that mediates </v>
<v Speaker 2>between them,</v>

165
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:58.450
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are the thing transforms and that's </v>

166
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 2>the right attitude for human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's what we are.</v>

167
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 2>We're the thing that voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>confronts chaos and transformed.</v>

168
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.550
<v Speaker 2>That's what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for better or worse,</v>

169
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:13.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's our deepest biological essence </v>

170
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 2>you might say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can let things go if you know</v>

171
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 2>that there's more growth to come.</v>

172
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
