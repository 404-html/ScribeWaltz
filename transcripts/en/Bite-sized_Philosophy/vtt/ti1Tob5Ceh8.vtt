00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Charlottesville had you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.820
<v Speaker 1>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

3
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.480
<v Speaker 1>with the initial purpose of protecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the statue.</v>

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Was it good thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

5
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

6
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about confederacy except </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the big thing,</v>

7
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.220
<v Speaker 1>but honestly it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a slippery,</v>

8
00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:23.221
<v Speaker 1>slippery slope and the confused souls </v>
<v Speaker 1>who and the bad just darkened soles for </v>

9
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Good.</v>

10
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>They screwed up big time because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose behind it is so important </v>

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.820
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to be fought founding</v>
<v Speaker 1>fathers next.</v>

12
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who ever contributed anything to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Western civilization as we know it is </v>

13
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.920
<v Speaker 1>already being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already being done.</v>

14
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>James Madison High School in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting renamed because some girls </v>

15
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>from random,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one student felt unsafe and so yeah,</v>

16
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.510
<v Speaker 1>this is a serious issue and I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

17
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I feel like really up against the wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>now because now they found they're </v>

18
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

19
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.120
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis are flooding the streets now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do we,</v>

20
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.130
<v Speaker 1>how do we possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.870
<v Speaker 1>kind of save our cakes.</v>

22
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.550
<v Speaker 2>You had to bring it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't ya?</v>

23
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the right degenerate into </v>

24
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 2>identity politics does not seem to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>

25
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.850
<v Speaker 2>a positive solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things I would say is </v>

26
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.291
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I understand why the identity </v>

27
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:38.191
<v Speaker 2>politics that has been practiced so </v>
<v Speaker 2>assiduously and so you have a stating </v>

28
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Lee by the left has been cooptive by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

29
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then here's what I would say to the </v>

30
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.450
<v Speaker 2>people on the right who were playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that game.</v>

31
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.190
<v Speaker 2>If you play the game of your enemies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you win,</v>

32
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.670
<v Speaker 2>you win their game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't win.</v>

33
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 2>That's not victory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just become the most successful </v>

34
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.260
<v Speaker 2>exponent of their pathology was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How was that a good thing?</v>

35
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does that leave people as old as</v>

36
00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:09.670
<v Speaker 2>an alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

37
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that the Caucasians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

38
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.820
<v Speaker 2>should revert to being white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a bad idea.</v>

39
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 2>It's a dangerous idea and it's coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast and I don't like to see that.</v>

40
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I think the whole group identity thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>is seriously pathological.</v>

41
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.950
<v Speaker 2>I think we've made big mistakes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>

42
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I understand why at least to some degree</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that respect and that large mistakes </v>

43
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.351
<v Speaker 2>are being made all over the western </v>
<v Speaker 2>world where we're making your group </v>

44
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:45.430
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most important thing about you?</v>

45
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 2>I think that's reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's devastating.</v>

46
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it's genocidal in its ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression.</v>

47
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.280
<v Speaker 2>I think it will bring down our </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization if we pursue it.</v>

48
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 2>We be playing that game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's the alternative?</v>

49
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought for a long time about a </v>

50
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.021
<v Speaker 2>political career really forever since I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like 12 really for a long time and </v>

51
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 2>I've always decided against it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to me that the proper level of</v>

52
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:20.971
<v Speaker 2>analysis with regards to the solution of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem that we're facing isn't </v>

53
00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:25.291
<v Speaker 2>political and that's why I think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake when what I'm doing gets </v>

54
00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 2>politicized either by me or others.</v>

55
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that the way that you deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is to put yourself together.</v>

56
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that is that because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that individual people are far </v>

57
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.231
<v Speaker 2>more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly far more evil than </v>

58
00:03:40.231 --> 00:03:42.511
<v Speaker 2>they're willing to consider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's also a sign of their </v>

59
00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:45.091
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that what you do is you aim </v>

60
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.150
<v Speaker 2>high and put yourself together and stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hell away from the ideologues </v>

61
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 2>because they're hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're hiding behind a wall.</v>

62
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:59.551
<v Speaker 2>They're not able to come out and fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>on their own behalf and so the way </v>

63
00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:04.501
<v Speaker 2>forward through the logical mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the lesson of Western </v>

64
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:07.801
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to place the individual at the place </v>

65
00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:11.251
<v Speaker 2>of paramount importance and to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>group identity emerge only when </v>

66
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 2>necessary and secondarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if ever.</v>

67
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 2>And so you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do that now.</v>

68
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 2>You can do that tomorrow.</v>

69
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Like you can put your life together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

70
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:25.501
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned to the other young man </v>

71
00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 2>who asked the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't hurt anyone doing that,</v>

72
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pick up your goddamn responsibility.</v>

73
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Certain yourself out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fix up your family,</v>

74
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you can be a force for good in </v>

75
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.870
<v Speaker 2>the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if enough people do that,</v>

76
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 2>the ideological mass will just </v>
<v Speaker 2>evaporate.</v>

77
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.680
<v Speaker 2>It'll just disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the way you show people </v>

78
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 2>the right path forward to is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

79
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

80
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would like,</v>

81
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 2>we would like it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could thrive as an individual,</v>

82
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 2>drop your cult like affiliation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

83
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Step out of the shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the demonic shadows your ideological </v>

84
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 2>possession and step forward as a fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed person into the light.</v>

85
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 2>Do it by example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your.</v>

86
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 2>That's your best bet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

87
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 2>So that's what it looks like to me.</v>

88
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.680
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
