1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:01.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:02.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.470
<v Speaker 1>you can say things to people like tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth and be good,</v>

4
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>and those are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are cliches obviously,</v>

5
00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:13.430
<v Speaker 1>and so they lack power because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliches,</v>

6
00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:18.431
<v Speaker 1>but you can take them apart and utilize </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a manner that stops being a </v>

7
00:00:18.431 --> 00:00:22.670
<v Speaker 1>cliche and you do that by being more </v>
<v Speaker 1>humble about them.</v>

8
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.760
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because maybe you can't tell the truth </v>

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.760
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know what the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

10
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.691
<v Speaker 1>but one thing you can do is you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>start saying things that you know to be </v>

11
00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:31.820
<v Speaker 1>untrue and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

12
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:34.790
<v Speaker 1>how do I know that they're untrue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>

13
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a whole philosophy of truth.</v>

14
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.950
<v Speaker 1>The elaboration of an entire philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>of truth to answer that question and so </v>

15
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.341
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to bother answering that</v>
<v Speaker 1>question because in some sense at the </v>

16
00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:45.920
<v Speaker 1>moment it's beside the point that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue.</v>

17
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.130
<v Speaker 1>The issue is there are times in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life where you know that the thing that </v>

18
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.830
<v Speaker 1>you're saying is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a deception.</v>

19
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a lie of some sort and you're using</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to manipulate yourself or another </v>

20
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.430
<v Speaker 1>person or the world and you're also </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed,</v>

21
00:00:58.431 --> 00:01:03.431
<v Speaker 1>fully possessed of the idea that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away with it and there's a satanic </v>

22
00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:07.301
<v Speaker 1>arrogance about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If in fact that is the archetype of </v>

23
00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:10.250
<v Speaker 1>arrogance that's portrayed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological character of Satan because </v>

24
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.081
<v Speaker 1>Satan is precisely the archetype of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of the mind that believes that </v>

25
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:19.841
<v Speaker 1>it can twist and and banned the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure reality without paying the </v>

26
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:25.181
<v Speaker 1>price for that and you can't imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's more arrogant than not </v>

27
00:01:25.181 --> 00:01:27.950
<v Speaker 1>because really do you really think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can twist the structure of a reality</v>

28
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>and that that's going to work out for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you without it snapping back.</v>

29
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>It's so obvious that that can't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

30
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.570
<v Speaker 1>that everyone knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

31
00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:40.571
<v Speaker 1>back to the initial point is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know by by the rules of the game that </v>

32
00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:46.091
<v Speaker 1>you yourself are playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That some of the Times you're violating </v>

33
00:01:46.091 --> 00:01:47.480
<v Speaker 1>the rules of the game that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing.</v>

34
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 1>And the first issue with regards to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stating the truth or behaving in a </v>

35
00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>responsible manner would be merely </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped cheating.</v>

36
00:01:57.831 --> 00:02:00.710
<v Speaker 1>At whatever game it is that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>chosen to play,</v>

37
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a good start and that'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightened.</v>

38
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 1>That'll straighten out your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll start district.</v>

39
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Start to straighten out your life and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the flood.</v>

40
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does the flood tie into this?</v>

41
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>we live in a corrupt structure were </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt as individuals.</v>

43
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:21.410
<v Speaker 1>We live in a corrupt structure and part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that corruption is just happenstance.</v>

44
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:26.411
<v Speaker 1>It's the way things fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other part of it is that not </v>

45
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:28.760
<v Speaker 1>only are we not aiming up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're actually aiming down and the flood</v>

46
00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:33.761
<v Speaker 1>story is a warning and it's a very clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>warning and the warning is if you aim </v>

47
00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 1>down enough and then if enough of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>aim down at the same time,</v>

48
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>everything will degenerate into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's</v>

49
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.130
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from the chaos from </v>
<v Speaker 1>which things emerged at the beginning of</v>

50
00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:53.131
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that because that </v>

51
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>the cosmos that's presented in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological representations is chaos </v>

52
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.840
<v Speaker 1>versus order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

53
00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:57.340
<v Speaker 1>The order is on top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

54
00:02:57.341 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>in the chaos is always underneath and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaos can break through or the order</v>

55
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>can crumble and you can fall into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and that chaos is intermingled,</v>

56
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.360
<v Speaker 1>intermingled potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way that you destroy the order </v>

57
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:14.521
<v Speaker 1>and let the chaos rise back up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly how it's portrayed in </v>

58
00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:18.061
<v Speaker 1>the flood story is by well by inhabiting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corpse of your father.</v>

59
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:23.791
<v Speaker 1>That's one mythological motif and </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeding on the remains and with no </v>

60
00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:28.350
<v Speaker 1>gratitude and no attempt to replenish </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that you're taking from and </v>

61
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:34.981
<v Speaker 1>the warning and the flood story is don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that for very long because things </v>

62
00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:39.811
<v Speaker 1>will happen that are so awful you cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly imagine it and that'll happen </v>

63
00:03:39.811 --> 00:03:39.811
<v Speaker 1>to you personally.</v>

64
00:03:39.811 --> 00:03:44.580
<v Speaker 1>It will happen to your family and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to your community and it's </v>

65
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.951
<v Speaker 1>happened to people over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout history and it is quite </v>

66
00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:46.951
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's.</v>

67
00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>It's very soon after the story of Cain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Abel.</v>

68
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>When you see evil enter the world in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story of Adam and Eve,</v>

69
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>along with self consciousness and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is the the ability.</v>

70
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the knowledge of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the ability to hurt other people,</v>

71
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>self-consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know what you're doing,</v>

72
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 1>and then of course instantly cane takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to the absolute extreme and he uses</v>

73
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>that capacity to to destroy really what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he loves best.</v>

74
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets as close as a human being can to</v>

75
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:19.021
<v Speaker 1>destroying the divine ideal because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course his brother Abel and Abel is </v>

76
00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:22.650
<v Speaker 1>favored by God and and destroys them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which cane tells God at the end of that </v>

77
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 1>episode that his punishment is more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can bear.</v>

78
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is where</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you?</v>

79
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Once you destroy your own ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's left for you?</v>

80
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.600
<v Speaker 1>There's nowhere to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no APP,</v>

81
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.780
<v Speaker 1>and when there is no APP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of down and you know </v>

82
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>there's an idea that was put forth very </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely in Milton's paradise lost when he</v>

83
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>was describing from a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

84
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Essentially what hell is hell is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhale to the degree that you're distant</v>

85
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:58.021
<v Speaker 1>from the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that might be a good way of </v>

86
00:04:58.021 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you destroy your own ideal,</v>

87
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.050
<v Speaker 1>which you do with jealousy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and the desire to pull down </v>

88
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>people who you would like to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

89
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.440
<v Speaker 1>then you end up in a situation that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from hell and and the </v>

90
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 1>way the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biblical story unfolds as well.</v>

91
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:17.191
<v Speaker 1>It's it's Cain and then it's the flood </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so kane adopts this motive being </v>

92
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>that's antithetical to being itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least a positive being itself.</v>

93
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 1>He does it voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does it knowing full well what he's </v>

94
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.331
<v Speaker 1>doing and the net consequence of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as it ripples through the entire </v>

95
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>social structure is that God stands back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>

96
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.340
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing has got so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing we can do is wipe it to </v>

97
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>the ground and that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is no joke.</v>

98
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.390
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly how things work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's </v>

99
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily terrifying about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence of stories,</v>

100
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>and I believe this to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I realized this independently of</v>

101
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>any of the analysis that I was doing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological stories because I looked at</v>

102
00:05:55.301 --> 00:06:00.301
<v Speaker 1>what happened in places like the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union and in Mao's China and in Nazi </v>

103
00:06:00.301 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Germany and the most penetrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>observers of those societies.</v>

104
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:08.621
<v Speaker 1>The people who are most interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>how it was that those absolute </v>

105
00:06:08.621 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes came about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All said the same thing.</v>

106
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>It was rooted in the degeneration of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals who made up the society.</v>

107
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear well,</v>

108
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>people will fraught were following </v>
<v Speaker 1>orders.</v>

109
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

110
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.460
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that explanation doesn't hold water or </v>

111
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 1>that you'd be punished if you resisted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While there was some truth in that,</v>

112
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 1>but nowhere near as much as people might</v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

113
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Especially at the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process more.</v>

114
00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 1>It was that people decided each and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every one of them to turn a blind eye to</v>

115
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:38.531
<v Speaker 1>the catastrophes and to participate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lies and that worked the entire </v>

116
00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they went,</v>

117
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:39.640
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

118
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>they veered their way downward to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something as closely approximating hell </v>

119
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 1>as you could hope to manage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in places like Nazi Germany.</v>

120
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 1>And while I in all three of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>

121
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 1>and in Maoist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and the Soviet Union,</v>

122
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:57.101
<v Speaker 1>and so the thing that's so frightening </v>
<v Speaker 1>about one of the things that's so </v>

123
00:06:57.101 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 1>frightening about the stories in genesis</v>
<v Speaker 1>is they say something very clear,</v>

124
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:04.511
<v Speaker 1>which is that your moral degeneration </v>
<v Speaker 1>contributes in no small way to the </v>

125
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 1>degeneration of the entire cosmos.</v>

126
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.350
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

127
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I would like my life to be meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People say that really would you really?</v>

128
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 1>You really would like your life to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.</v>

129
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 1>You think maybe people would trade a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little nihilism to not have to face that</v>

130
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 1>particular realization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think people do that all the time.</v>

131
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible wait to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

132
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.610
<v Speaker 1>to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are networked together and that </v>

133
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.571
<v Speaker 1>that's the price of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or let's say that's the vulnerability </v>

134
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:36.830
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with our intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to communicate.</v>

135
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.310
<v Speaker 1>And it is certainly possible that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ripples of our individual actions have </v>

136
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 1>consequences that are far beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 1>limits of our immediate consciousness.</v>

137
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:54.430
<v Speaker 1>And I also think people know that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that in the way that people </v>

138
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 1>know things when they don't want to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

139
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.190
<v Speaker 1>which means they know them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied,</v>

140
00:07:58.191 --> 00:07:59.900
<v Speaker 1>they can feel them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can sense them,</v>

141
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:02.960
<v Speaker 1>they have an emotional response to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no damn way they're going to</v>

142
00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:07.961
<v Speaker 1>let them become articulate because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to know and when you're </v>

143
00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:09.590
<v Speaker 1>feeling guilty and ashamed about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you've done or not done,</v>

144
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.900
<v Speaker 1>and I know that can get out of hand as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

145
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:17.230
<v Speaker 1>It's often because there is a crooked </v>
<v Speaker 1>little part of you that's aiming at the </v>

146
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.590
<v Speaker 1>worst possible outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

147
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:20.720
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you said about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow,</v>

148
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:25.721
<v Speaker 1>you know that young's famous idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has a dark side and that that </v>

149
00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:26.990
<v Speaker 1>dark side needs to be incorporated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>made conscious.</v>

150
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Young said that to the shadow of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being,</v>

151
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.700
<v Speaker 1>reaches all the way to hell and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

152
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that's so interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about interesting about reading Carl </v>

153
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he actually means what he says.</v>

154
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>

155
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:43.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

156
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:48.330
<v Speaker 1>the part of you that's twisted against </v>
<v Speaker 1>being is aligned with the part of the </v>

157
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:53.801
<v Speaker 1>cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the conscious cosmos that's </v>

158
00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:56.890
<v Speaker 1>aiming at making everything as terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it can possibly be and you know it's </v>

159
00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.581
<v Speaker 1>a terrible shock to realize that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly why people don't realize </v>

160
00:09:01.581 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 1>that it's something that people keep at </v>
<v Speaker 1>an arm's length.</v>

161
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 1>It's the same as recognizing yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Nazi concentration camp camp guard,</v>

162
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:13.191
<v Speaker 1>which is a very useful exercise because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's absolutely no reason why you </v>

163
00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:16.971
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have been or still could be one</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and if you think otherwise,</v>

164
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.120
<v Speaker 1>then all the more reason for assuming </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would be unable to resist the </v>

165
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 1>temptation if it wasn't in fact offered </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

166
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:26.760
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>temptation,</v>

167
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:32.060
<v Speaker 1>then the then there's so much that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know about human beings that </v>

168
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 1>you're not even in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if it wasn't a temptation,</v>

169
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:36.330
<v Speaker 1>then people bloody well wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done it.</v>

170
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.030
<v Speaker 1>And plenty of people did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's no wonder.</v>
