1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of debate in the </v>

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.681
<v Speaker 1>scientific literature about the meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of dreams and perhaps there's even </v>

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>debate about whether it's possible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams to have meaning.</v>

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I think partly the debate exists because</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do dream analysis properly,</v>

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.480
<v Speaker 1>as union particular pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.740
<v Speaker 1>you need a vast body of knowledge in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream interpreter about comparative </v>

7
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:31.581
<v Speaker 1>mythology and ritual and symbol and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and art history and so forth because </v>

8
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:38.301
<v Speaker 1>dreams of course use images as their </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary means of conceptualization now </v>

9
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>in order to understand what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what dreams mean and how they can be </v>

10
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.611
<v Speaker 1>useful in therapy apart from </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciating the fact that the </v>

11
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:54.831
<v Speaker 1>interpreter needs a broad body of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that scientists generally </v>

12
00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:59.391
<v Speaker 1>don't develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also important to know what it is </v>

13
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>that scientists have discovered about </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

14
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that dreams occur during rapid </v>

15
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>eye movement sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cycle into rapid eye movement.</v>

16
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Sleep about every 90 minutes when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>asleep,</v>

17
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>when you're in rapid eye movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>

18
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.860
<v Speaker 1>your motor centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your action centers are very much </v>

19
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.061
<v Speaker 1>activated in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your body is paralyzed so that you </v>

20
00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 1>can't move around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

21
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.780
<v Speaker 1>your eyes are moving because of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter if your eyes </v>

22
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>move while you're asleep because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't take you anywhere,</v>

23
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>but if your legs were moving while you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were asleep,</v>

24
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:41.241
<v Speaker 1>you run into walls while you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreaming and scientists have actually </v>

25
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.790
<v Speaker 1>managed to damage the motor inhibition </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems in cats so that they do move </v>

26
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:53.991
<v Speaker 1>around when they're dreaming anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wake up when someone's dreaming,</v>

27
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 1>their brain is about as active as it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're awake,</v>

28
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>so there's a tremendous amount of neural</v>
<v Speaker 1>processing going on in the dream state.</v>

29
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>If you wake someone up when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreaming,</v>

30
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 1>there's about an 80 percent chance that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll report the emotion of anxiety.</v>

31
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Dreams tend to focus on threat </v>
<v Speaker 1>processing.</v>

32
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a threat is anything that might hurt </v>

33
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.811
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more than that to a threat is </v>

34
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>anything that doesn't fit into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>current conceptual scheme.</v>

35
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you have a theory about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the world is and then you act on</v>

36
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:33.660
<v Speaker 1>that theory and sometimes things work </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the way you'd like them to work out,</v>

37
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.020
<v Speaker 1>but often they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every time things work out in a way </v>

38
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.281
<v Speaker 1>that isn't how you would like or how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted that indicates that there's </v>

39
00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:48.441
<v Speaker 1>some more about the world that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn about and that fact first </v>

40
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:54.051
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself in anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the dream focuses on anxiety and </v>

41
00:02:55.651 --> 00:03:00.651
<v Speaker 1>then it loosens up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the normal conceptual constraints </v>

42
00:03:00.651 --> 00:03:05.311
<v Speaker 1>that characterize waking thinking and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to play in a sense or hypothesize</v>

43
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.290
<v Speaker 1>about how your current categorical </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure could be shifted around so </v>

44
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>that that threat could be accounted for.</v>

45
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that means the dream is dealing with</v>

46
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 1>things that you need to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't yet understand.</v>

47
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>So when you wake up and you remember the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>

48
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.290
<v Speaker 1>the dream doesn't really make sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's about something you don't </v>

49
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.351
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's your brain's best guess at </v>

50
00:03:34.351 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>configuring or understanding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknowable,</v>

51
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's like it's like the first layer </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a multilayered process,</v>

52
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.370
<v Speaker 1>which eventually would culminate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully developed thought maybe over </v>

53
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.010
<v Speaker 1>months or maybe over years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you would never manage it at </v>

54
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.531
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unknown thing or the threat is just </v>

55
00:03:55.531 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>too great to really come to any terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it whatsoever.</v>

56
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine that you're dreaming about </v>

57
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.841
<v Speaker 1>something and it produces enough emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the threat produces enough emotion,</v>

58
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>not only to produce a very vivid dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to wake you up.</v>

59
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.880
<v Speaker 1>When you wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember the dream and then you go </v>

60
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>to someone about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.600
<v Speaker 1>the dream is about something you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet understand that it's upsetting and </v>

62
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.011
<v Speaker 1>if you tell a bunch of people about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to give you all sorts of </v>

63
00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:25.621
<v Speaker 1>opinions on the dream and that's a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can gather more information </v>

64
00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:25.621
<v Speaker 1>about the threat,</v>

65
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.950
<v Speaker 2>which is known as a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps Cynthia dream,</v>

66
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:36.951
<v Speaker 2>which is troubling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all puzzling because it's so abstract.</v>

67
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Could you differentiate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

68
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.100
<v Speaker 1>it's clearer in the case of nightmares </v>
<v Speaker 1>and often too,</v>

69
00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:45.780
<v Speaker 1>because nightmares tend to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetipal themes.</v>

70
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people for example,</v>

71
00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:52.751
<v Speaker 1>are often threatened by monsters at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night and a monster is a Chi Mira that's</v>

72
00:04:53.091 --> 00:04:57.680
<v Speaker 1>made up of the different parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different parts of frightening thing.</v>

73
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.020
<v Speaker 1>A dragon is a camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

74
00:05:00.021 --> 00:05:05.021
<v Speaker 1>because it's made out of reptilian parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it also includes the idea of fire in</v>

75
00:05:06.441 --> 00:05:11.441
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a nightmare is that a dream that </v>

76
00:05:11.631 --> 00:05:16.631
<v Speaker 1>tends to use archetipal imagery to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize a fairly powerful threat </v>

77
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>and if you recounted nightmare to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person with no specific training,</v>

78
00:05:22.551 --> 00:05:27.551
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have some opinion about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and their opinion might be useful in </v>

79
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:28.520
<v Speaker 1>terms of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Katherine,</v>

80
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.030
<v Speaker 1>but if you recount a dream to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's psychologically trained and his </v>

81
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>also symbolically trained and who has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.030
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great depth of knowledge with regards to</v>

83
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.900
<v Speaker 1>the structure of religious thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and comparative literature.</v>

84
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>The light that they're going to shed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your dream is much greater and more </v>

85
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.761
<v Speaker 1>profound and sometimes a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dream interpretation can offer the </v>

86
00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>person who's had the dream a leap </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward in knowledge that might've taken</v>

87
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>them five or six years to conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 1>by themselves.</v>

88
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.040
<v Speaker 2>No ordinarily have had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the person who's the expert </v>

89
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.110
<v Speaker 2>who's had the dream recounted to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows and says,</v>

90
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know of that place that they say the </v>

91
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.460
<v Speaker 2>theme to that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've had that symbol and it's meaning</v>

92
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.870
<v Speaker 2>and a bubble what it feels like because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of surely it is,</v>

93
00:06:22.871 --> 00:06:25.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people say that me included,</v>

94
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm that one way to interpret a dream </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you wake up is to just like you </v>

95
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.460
<v Speaker 2>would taste a sip of wine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just hold the flavor and,</v>

96
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:42.731
<v Speaker 2>and hold the feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it feel like and what does </v>

97
00:06:42.731 --> 00:06:43.240
<v Speaker 2>feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what feels the same in your real life?</v>

98
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.360
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the dream is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you with a collage of singles and </v>

99
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.730
<v Speaker 2>memories as well that is drawn on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>recent.</v>

100
00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:53.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

101
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.730
<v Speaker 2>experience to try and put it together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hence the dream can be very abstract.</v>

102
00:06:57.731 --> 00:06:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Would you say that's the case?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes</v>

103
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 1>I think there's two things are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth highlighting in the first is the </v>

104
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 1>category is that a dream uses are </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally based on emotional similarity </v>

105
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.820
<v Speaker 1>rather than logical similarity?</v>

106
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

107
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:20.590
<v Speaker 1>So a dream for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might represent fear or the fear of </v>

108
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:25.601
<v Speaker 1>something unknown by using a </v>
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposition of a variety of images of </v>

109
00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 1>frightening thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that in the dream world,</v>

110
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:33.461
<v Speaker 1>the basic rule is all things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced the same emotion are the same </v>

111
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:38.410
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're a description of a dream </v>

112
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:43.601
<v Speaker 1>interpretation process that relies on </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifying similarities in emotional </v>

113
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:48.911
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets right to the core of how dream </v>

114
00:07:48.911 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 1>thought works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now secondarily,</v>

115
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:54.530
<v Speaker 1>I also believe that if you are able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help someone,</v>

116
00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:00.610
<v Speaker 1>a construct at dream interpretation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fits there also able to feel that it </v>

117
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 1>fits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it clicks or it makes sense or it's like</v>

118
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:10.061
<v Speaker 1>the punchline of a joke in some way they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell that the interpretation have,</v>

119
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:15.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put some missing pieces of the puzzle </v>

120
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.341
<v Speaker 1>into place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's important to rely on </v>

121
00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:21.821
<v Speaker 1>that as an indicator of whether the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation is actually derived from </v>

122
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:26.450
<v Speaker 1>the dream or sort of just at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical imposition on its structure.</v>

123
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Now we can go underneath that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mentioned already that basic </v>

124
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.790
<v Speaker 1>categories are more action oriented than</v>
<v Speaker 1>object oriented.</v>

125
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.240
<v Speaker 1>So basic categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic categories of the human mind </v>

126
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.080
<v Speaker 1>are categories to do things with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

127
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.380
<v Speaker 1>by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are also motivational and </v>

128
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>emotional categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the primordial mind,</v>

129
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.740
<v Speaker 1>like the animal mind thinks sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>axiomatically that all things that </v>

130
00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:59.081
<v Speaker 1>produced the same are the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's things that make you happy or</v>

131
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:03.570
<v Speaker 1>there's things that make you sad or </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's things that make you anxious and</v>

132
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:08.571
<v Speaker 1>the fact that all those things share the</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to evoke that emotion speaks of</v>

133
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>some essential essential identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>between them.</v>

134
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Now the identity is in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the experiencer and not necessarily with</v>

135
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:20.730
<v Speaker 1>regards to similarity between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects,</v>

136
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:26.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's still how we naturally think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly how mythologies </v>

137
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.980
<v Speaker 1>thinks and it's how drama thinks and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion things.</v>

138
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:35.810
<v Speaker 1>We've lost sight of that in part because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've become scientifically trained to </v>

139
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.381
<v Speaker 1>some degree and we tend to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the real categories of the world are </v>

140
00:09:39.381 --> 00:09:39.930
<v Speaker 1>objective and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

141
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just strikes me as it's wrong.</v>

142
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 1>There's something about it that's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's wrong because we have to act.</v>
