1
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.270
<v Speaker 1>So I've noticed when I've lived in </v>
<v Speaker 1>places rented or owned,</v>

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.270
<v Speaker 1>didn't matter then if there were part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place,</v>

3
00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:11.270
<v Speaker 1>if there was a part of the place that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't attended to,</v>

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.910
<v Speaker 1>whatever that might mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might meant cleaned.</v>

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.510
<v Speaker 1>It might've meant fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly meant at least </v>

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.210
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly investigated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that was chaos.</v>

7
00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:22.700
<v Speaker 1>It was like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like the desert.</v>

8
00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:24.530
<v Speaker 1>That part that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a way of thinking about it.</v>

9
00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if I owned it wasn't mine.</v>

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.840
<v Speaker 1>I had to interact with it before it </v>
<v Speaker 1>became mine and I had to interact with </v>

11
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.190
<v Speaker 1>it and I had to put it in order and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became mine and then.</v>

12
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>And then to the degree that it became </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine and was in order,</v>

13
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:42.161
<v Speaker 1>then I was also put an order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know that because you go into </v>

14
00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>places that make you uncomfortable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's your own house,</v>

15
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>it's highly probable.</v>

16
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.750
<v Speaker 1>It's highly probable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

17
00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:48.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked into.</v>

18
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Well Chinese doctors do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Traditional Chinese doctors,</v>

19
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:56.861
<v Speaker 1>they go into place people's place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they diagnosed their health conditions </v>

20
00:00:56.861 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the balance of Yin and Yang chaos and</v>

21
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:01.550
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walk into a house that this is easy</v>

22
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:02.780
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk into a house,</v>

23
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>there's too much chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

24
00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>you can detect that in no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is out of order and chaotic.</v>

25
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:14.201
<v Speaker 1>You don't even want to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You certainly don't want to open the </v>

26
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:14.201
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure,</v>

27
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:16.040
<v Speaker 1>and there are things that should've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>done years ago,</v>

28
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:21.041
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and every one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a fight that hasn't happened and </v>

29
00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:25.061
<v Speaker 1>something that's been avoided and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't even walk in there and maintain </v>

30
00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:25.061
<v Speaker 1>your health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you walk in there,</v>

31
00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:29.861
<v Speaker 1>you're sicker than you were when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were outside and that's one sort of </v>

32
00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:29.861
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

33
00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:33.640
<v Speaker 1>And then another sort of places you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and you look at the living room and </v>

34
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.340
<v Speaker 1>the person has vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The living room rug and the lines that </v>

35
00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:44.501
<v Speaker 1>were vacuumed are parallel to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another and the and the furniture is </v>

36
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:49.301
<v Speaker 1>covered with plastic and you get a glass</v>
<v Speaker 1>of water and then just as you're going </v>

37
00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:53.141
<v Speaker 1>to set it down on the coffee table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person rushes over and puts a </v>

38
00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:56.141
<v Speaker 1>coaster underneath it and everything in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that house says to you that it would be </v>

39
00:01:56.141 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>a lot more perfect in that house if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were either not there or dead and that's</v>

40
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.040
<v Speaker 1>and that's the message that the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>house is blasting at you.</v>

41
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 1>And if you happen to live there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be sick and what </v>

42
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.761
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be sick from is too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>order and in the other house you're </v>

43
00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:16.750
<v Speaker 1>going to be sick from too much chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you interact with a house,</v>

44
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.340
<v Speaker 1>the unexplored parts are the chaos that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that parts that you have not yet </v>

45
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.361
<v Speaker 1>contended with are the chaos that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>not yet been transformed by your </v>

46
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 1>embodied logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Action into habitable territory.</v>

47
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>And it does not belong to you.</v>
