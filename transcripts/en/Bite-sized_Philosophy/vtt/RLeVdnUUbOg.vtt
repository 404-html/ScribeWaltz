00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Traditional Chinese doctors go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's houses to diagnose why it is </v>

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.311
<v Speaker 1>that someone in that house of suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they walk in and they think there's </v>

3
00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>too much order here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in houses like that.</v>

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a house where all the furniture </v>
<v Speaker 1>is covered with plastic.</v>

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>That's a house where if you put a glass </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a wooden table,</v>

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>that mistress of the house runs over </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the coaster,</v>

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>slips it under immediately and gives you</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dirty look.</v>

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a place where the children never </v>
<v Speaker 1>play in the living room.</v>

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.080
<v Speaker 1>That's a place where the lines in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>carpet or vacuum so precisely that </v>

10
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:38.451
<v Speaker 1>they're actually parallel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a place where there's so much </v>

11
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:42.921
<v Speaker 1>order that no one can survive because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who runs the house as a </v>

12
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:45.801
<v Speaker 1>tyrant and then anyone who's sick in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that house is sick because they're </v>

13
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:49.071
<v Speaker 1>suffering from an excess of order and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can walk into a house that's </v>

14
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>completely different and you can even </v>
<v Speaker 1>see this in your own room if you want.</v>

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Everything's in complete disarray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even look at that place.</v>

16
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>You're sick the moment you cross the </v>
<v Speaker 1>threshold because everywhere you look,</v>

17
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.440
<v Speaker 1>there's parts of an transforms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos yelling to you,</v>

18
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>do something about this loser.</v>
