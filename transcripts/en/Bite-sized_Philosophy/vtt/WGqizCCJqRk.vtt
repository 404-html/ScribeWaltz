1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.030
<v Speaker 1>So no cue goes off to meet the coachman </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the coachman has already said he's </v>

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>collecting bad little boys and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.730
<v Speaker 1>he's got them on the coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all delinquent types here.</v>

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>The ticket on the coach was the ace of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spades,</v>

5
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:20.871
<v Speaker 1>which is what Pinocchio is holding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's with this character here called</v>

6
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Lamp Wick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting name.</v>

7
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:28.521
<v Speaker 1>So he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the thing that Burns in the middle </v>

8
00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:31.611
<v Speaker 1>of a light lamp wick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's interesting because it's a </v>

9
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 1>play on Lucifer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer means bringer of light.</v>

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.870
<v Speaker 1>And so lamp wick is a play on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lamb pork is really a nasty piece of</v>

11
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:41.300
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got this false arrogance about him.</v>

12
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.340
<v Speaker 1>He's got this like this cynical voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really deeply cynical voice and he's </v>

13
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.091
<v Speaker 1>only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how old he is supposed to </v>

14
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:50.091
<v Speaker 1>be in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 12 or something like that are 13.</v>

15
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>And so he's one of those kids who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's become prematurely cynical.</v>

16
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a story about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I used to live in Montreal.</v>

17
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in a poor neighborhood.</v>

18
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.180
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day I was out in the back alley </v>

19
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>building a fence because I was putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>little fence around my back,</v>

20
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 1>my little tiny backyard and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>house across the alley down the street,</v>

21
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:18.420
<v Speaker 1>a ways where there is a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not good partying.</v>

22
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Lot of bikers are hanging around there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I knew there was a little kid that </v>

23
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>lived there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

24
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:28.971
<v Speaker 1>I was out there in the back alley </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounding away on my fence and these </v>

25
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:28.971
<v Speaker 1>little kids came up and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>

26
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>They were like three and four years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>

27
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.420
<v Speaker 1>And they spoke a Jew all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A kind of a really heavily accented </v>

28
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Quebecois French and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My French isn't good,</v>

29
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>so I could hardly understand them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were what they were watching me</v>

30
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>hammer and they got a little closer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had one,</v>

31
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.610
<v Speaker 1>one kid who was clearly the leader had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real scowl on his face.</v>

32
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.200
<v Speaker 1>And so they were watching and I kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motion to one of them that they could </v>

33
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>use the hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that kid said,</v>

34
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

35
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna mangle this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he says you have olay or something </v>

36
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what it meant is I'll steal that.</v>

37
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:08.091
<v Speaker 1>and then he came over and he tugged on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and he wanted me to take it and he </v>

39
00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>was quite angry and while I wasn't gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them take it.</v>

40
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>And then so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I couldn't engage them.</v>

41
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get him to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>and his buddies were sort of hanging </v>
<v Speaker 1>around behind him and they wouldn't come</v>

43
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:20.670
<v Speaker 1>and play because he wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was hostile right away to me.</v>

44
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.270
<v Speaker 1>And then so the finance piece was laying</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the La and these little monsters </v>

45
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 1>started running across it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was really remarkable,</v>

46
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

47
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.010
<v Speaker 1>But it was terrible at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were really little kids </v>

48
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.150
<v Speaker 1>that shouldn't be happening when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like three or four if that's happening </v>

49
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.150
<v Speaker 1>at that age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are not good.</v>

50
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>And so that kid was already like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously not happy with the world.</v>

51
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been studying antisocial behavior </v>

52
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 1>for a long time by that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I knew that the kids who are </v>

53
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.831
<v Speaker 1>destined to jail later in their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our kids who are rough and tough when </v>

54
00:02:57.831 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>they're two years old but then don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

55
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>or maybe worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get anti socialized,</v>

56
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what happened to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>

57
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:08.581
<v Speaker 1>He'd obviously been ignored and abused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm certainly no one had ever played </v>

58
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>with them in any real way because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't play.</v>

59
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's not good if a kid is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>little and you can't get them to play,</v>

60
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:21.151
<v Speaker 1>something's gone seriously wrong because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so playful at that age that </v>

61
00:03:21.151 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like 90 percent of them.</v>

62
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were running back and forth on </v>

63
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.180
<v Speaker 1>this fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it stomping on it,</v>

64
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was right there.</v>

65
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

66
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

67
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:34.651
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also thought it was absolutely </v>

68
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:34.651
<v Speaker 1>horrifying because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:39.600
<v Speaker 1>in some sense I could see where this kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>was headed and why at that early stage </v>

70
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 1>in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

71
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not a pleasant thing to behold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>but there was nothing that could be done</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

73
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of what this lamp wick </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like.</v>

74
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.230
<v Speaker 1>He's prematurely cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kid was already cynical and he was </v>

75
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>like four years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>most kids don't get cynical till they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenagers,</v>

77
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then often they don't get completely</v>

78
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:00.400
<v Speaker 1>cynical and usually they more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow out of it.</v>

79
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>But he had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened him much earlier.</v>

80
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 1>So this lamp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what character he'd already,</v>

81
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>he's already decided that he knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that everyone else is.</v>

82
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.670
<v Speaker 1>His opinion is worth nothing and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing in culture society that </v>

83
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>holds any use utility whatsoever for </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like him.</v>

84
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Now you can imagine developing that way </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were raised in a family where </v>

85
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.050
<v Speaker 1>people were generally generally lying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and that they randomly treated you </v>

86
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.281
<v Speaker 1>or neglected you and that you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>discern anything about them that was </v>

87
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>admirable or positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.030
<v Speaker 1>of course you'd assume that the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure is corrupt and that you had to</v>

89
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 1>take care of yourself and no one else </v>
<v Speaker 1>will not.</v>

90
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Of course not everyone assumes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>under those situations,</v>

91
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a.</v>

92
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>But it's a logical set of conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

93
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 1>And of course it's proportionate to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree to how much abuse you take.</v>

94
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Although there are lots of stories of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who've been terribly abused as </v>

95
00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 1>children who grew up to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 1>kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable,</v>

97
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.720
<v Speaker 1>responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful people who were absolutely </v>

98
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 1>opposed to abuse instead of propagating </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

99
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.240
<v Speaker 1>There's no direct causal pathway.</v>
