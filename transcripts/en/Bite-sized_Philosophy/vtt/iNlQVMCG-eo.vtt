1
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.360
<v Speaker 1>How would you summarize why men are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis now?</v>

2
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because it in a deep level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the West has lost faith in the idea of </v>

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.571
<v Speaker 1>masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's no different than the death </v>

4
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing and so and need chip</v>

5
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.280
<v Speaker 1>knew what the consequences of that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

6
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's most of what he wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and so you'd say,</v>

7
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:29.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the divine symbol of masculinity has </v>

8
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:29.731
<v Speaker 1>been obliterated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:31.960
<v Speaker 1>so then what do you expect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen?</v>

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.900
<v Speaker 1>It's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means masculinity is going to </v>

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.961
<v Speaker 1>become weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially if the symbol is also </v>

12
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:40.570
<v Speaker 1>denigrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Which it definitely is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that the ideal </v>

14
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>that man could aspire to is denigrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while then with your ideal in </v>

15
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.530
<v Speaker 1>tatters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're weak.</v>

16
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.270
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's definitional.</v>

17
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>So I think the reason that men have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>responding positively to my,</v>

18
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.810
<v Speaker 1>my thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

19
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>is that I don't buy any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the masculine spirit.</v>

20
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.020
<v Speaker 1>It's necessary and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally</v>

21
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>carnage and pillaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fundamentally rape culture.</v>

22
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.130
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not fundamentally world destroying </v>

23
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.090
<v Speaker 1>and all of those things have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those aspersions have been cast </v>

24
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.841
<v Speaker 1>upon it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's partly the guilt of Western </v>

25
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Society for technological progress even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are reasonable challenges to </v>

26
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:48.531
<v Speaker 1>be set before men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not reasonable accusations </v>

27
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>to swallow without criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a masculinity we can aspire to?</v>

28
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a responsibility fundamentally and </v>

29
00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

30
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>it's to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put it symbolically is that your </v>

31
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>responsibility is to incarnate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit of the logos.</v>

32
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>That's your responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your role in life,</v>

33
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.830
<v Speaker 1>and that is independent to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>in whether or not you accept the idea of</v>

34
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:22.341
<v Speaker 1>a transcendent eternal reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not making a case for that or </v>

35
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.540
<v Speaker 1>against that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are beyond human </v>

36
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.200
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know what happens if people act </v>

37
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>poorly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If men act badly,</v>

38
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>we know what happens.</v>

39
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>We know that the world turns into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's so close to hell,</v>

40
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:46.191
<v Speaker 1>but the difference is trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that that's the story of the </v>

41
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:50.781
<v Speaker 1>20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we should learn that lesson and what </v>

42
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.200
<v Speaker 1>that lesson is is pick up the world on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your shoulders and walk forward,</v>

43
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 1>pick up the world with all of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble,</v>

44
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.440
<v Speaker 1>with all of it's suffering with all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its evil and move forward with it and in</v>

45
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:10.051
<v Speaker 1>bearing that burden learned that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were that sort of creature that can bear</v>

46
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 1>that burden and therefore deserving of </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>

47
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

48
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>that's identification with the logos and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

49
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never encountered an idea that's </v>

50
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>better than that because it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so not naive.</v>

51
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.520
<v Speaker 1>It's the opposite of naive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's terrible evil and </v>

52
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>there's terrible suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bottomless,</v>

53
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.750
<v Speaker 1>but the human spirit is capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily taking that on as a </v>

54
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>it's worth a try.</v>

56
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

57
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

58
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the positive.</v>

59
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the positive meaning.</v>

60
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the world affirming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning you know,</v>

61
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 1>and that that's that self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

62
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very poorly characterized.</v>

63
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.320
<v Speaker 1>It's very shallowly characterized </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it usually doesn't involve any </v>

64
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.350
<v Speaker 1>sense of responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

65
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious in some ways if you look at</v>

66
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>the people that other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously respect,</v>

67
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>unless they've become unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical,</v>

68
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 1>it's the people who adopt responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>and deal with it competently,</v>

69
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a mystery that that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you could aspire to.</v>

70
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Now it it gets undermined if you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that force of responsibility is the</v>

71
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.920
<v Speaker 1>raping and pillaging patriarchal culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's despoiling the natural </v>

72
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>environment and that's equivalent to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

73
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that.</v>
