00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Carl jung talked about this phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he cried phenomenon,</v>

2
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>he described as a retrogressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>restoration of the persona and so it's a</v>

3
00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:24.331
<v Speaker 1>complicated idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically what it means is that </v>

4
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:26.770
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you take a leap forward and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn some things,</v>

5
00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:31.771
<v Speaker 1>but you can't catalyze a new identity so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to go back and hide in your old </v>

6
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:35.701
<v Speaker 1>identity and that actually doesn't work </v>
<v Speaker 1>because while things have changed and </v>

7
00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:39.910
<v Speaker 1>you've learned something and that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are anymore,</v>

8
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>and so it's like you have to cut part </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of yourself off in a destructive </v>

9
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.770
<v Speaker 1>manner to fit back into the person that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were.</v>

10
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Now What happens here is that Pinocchio </v>
<v Speaker 1>escapes from this tyrannical situation </v>

11
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.910
<v Speaker 1>and undergoes this descend into chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he tries to go back home.</v>

12
00:00:57.911 --> 00:01:01.660
<v Speaker 1>He tries to go back to what he was and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't do that anymore.</v>

13
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.220
<v Speaker 1>His father isn't at home anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

14
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.530
<v Speaker 1>so when he goes home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he finds that there's no home there.</v>

15
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Now this happens to people sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often a shock to them.</v>

16
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:21.460
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I've noticed about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Pan type,</v>

17
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to speak about men here </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've observed it more in men,</v>

18
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 1>is that they often stay under the thumb </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their father and you think,</v>

19
00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:37.261
<v Speaker 1>well why would someone do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it means they're subject to the </v>

20
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:41.701
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical judgment of their father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always concerned about what </v>

21
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:42.130
<v Speaker 1>their father would think or whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>their father approves of it,</v>

22
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.670
<v Speaker 1>of the and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

23
00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 1>well that's gotta be an unpleasant place</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

24
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I've suggested to</v>

25
00:01:55.331 --> 00:02:00.331
<v Speaker 1>my clients and to other people sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that here's a weird little exercise </v>

26
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 1>that you can undertake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little thought experiment.</v>

27
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>So you have your parents and of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>your parents have friends who are about </v>

28
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.751
<v Speaker 1>their age and maybe some of them are </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you only know peripherally and I </v>

29
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:13.630
<v Speaker 1>might ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.630
<v Speaker 1>do you care more about what your parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>think?</v>

31
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Then you care about what these </v>
<v Speaker 1>peripheral people who know your parents </v>

32
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.180
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the answer to that is,</v>

33
00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:23.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

34
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.810
<v Speaker 1>And then the question that arises out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is</v>

35
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

36
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone else,</v>

37
00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:34.570
<v Speaker 1>your parents are the peripheral people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their parents are central.</v>

38
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Like why is it logical that your parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>make opinion makes any more difference </v>

39
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.930
<v Speaker 1>to you than the appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the,</v>

40
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:47.680
<v Speaker 1>the opinion of some randomly selected </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are approximately that age.</v>

42
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Why is it the case that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider that they would know more than </v>

43
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 1>someone else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

44
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I know they know you better and fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

45
00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:58.981
<v Speaker 1>but that that's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another point there is that the</v>

46
00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:04.201
<v Speaker 1>degree that your parents opinion about </v>
<v Speaker 1>you matters more than some randomly </v>

47
00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>selected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have approximately the same age.</v>

48
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Young would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

49
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>you haven't exactly separated out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

50
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>the image from your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're still under that,</v>

51
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.900
<v Speaker 1>that combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a complicated thing to talk </v>

52
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But think about the Harry Potter series.</v>

53
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Harry has two sets of parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

54
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>He's got the [inaudible] parents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he's got these like magical parents</v>

55
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>that sort of float behind and he should </v>
<v Speaker 1>know the difference between them.</v>

56
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't be one in the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not for him,</v>

57
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.640
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

58
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.660
<v Speaker 1>you have your parents and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature and culture as parents and you </v>

59
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be thinking that your parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>are nature and culture as well.</v>

60
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't have final dominion over </v>
<v Speaker 1>you means that you're not an individual.</v>

61
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case.</v>

62
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Freud said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

63
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

64
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>no one could be a man and less his </v>
<v Speaker 1>father had died and young said,</v>

65
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:58.591
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that death can take place </v>

66
00:03:58.591 --> 00:03:58.591
<v Speaker 1>symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

67
00:03:58.591 --> 00:04:02.281
<v Speaker 1>so there's that part of the idea and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then another part of the idea is one of </v>

68
00:04:02.661 --> 00:04:07.661
<v Speaker 1>the times in your life when you actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that you're an individual is </v>

69
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:11.501
<v Speaker 1>when you'll go and ask your parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you'll realize they </v>

70
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:11.501
<v Speaker 1>actually don't know anymore about</v>

71
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you do,</v>

72
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>and that sucks and that's partly why </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are often willing to maintain a </v>

73
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.510
<v Speaker 1>tyrant slave relationship with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

74
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be inferior in a </v>

75
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 1>relationship like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

76
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 1>you've always got the judge watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

77
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 1>but another hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always someone who knows what to</v>

78
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:36.421
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always someone standing between </v>

79
00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 1>you and the unknown that you can go ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should I do?</v>

80
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point you'll realize that the </v>

81
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.650
<v Speaker 1>reason you can't ask that anymore is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they actually don't know anymore</v>

82
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.750
<v Speaker 1>than you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that's a pain like that.</v>

83
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.790
<v Speaker 1>That is a symbolic death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's also when you establish a more </v>

84
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>individual relationship with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

85
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.230
<v Speaker 1>it's at that point that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceivably start taking care of them </v>

86
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 1>instead of the reverse and that's a time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should come,</v>

87
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>but you have to let that image of </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfection go and that exposes you.</v>

88
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens here.</v>

89
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio goes home and he wants things </v>

90
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.071
<v Speaker 1>to be the way they were and he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay under the careful care of the </v>

91
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 1>benevolent father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's no longer possible.</v>

92
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:21.901
<v Speaker 1>He's past that point and that's why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>father has disappeared and so Japan has </v>

93
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:25.750
<v Speaker 1>gone off to look for Pinocchio because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he also needs Sun,</v>

94
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

95
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>but in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house is abandoned and so then we </v>

96
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.811
<v Speaker 1>see inside the house that everything's </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered with cobwebs and everything's </v>

97
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Gone and Pinocchio and the cricket sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the steps and they're very concerned.</v>

98
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wonder where he went so they're </v>

99
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.291
<v Speaker 1>actually concerned that he's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also don't know what to do </v>

100
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:50.261
<v Speaker 1>because there's just no going home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's also the case that once </v>

101
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:52.790
<v Speaker 1>you hit a certain point in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

102
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.580
<v Speaker 1>well it's the same thing we already </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about.</v>

103
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 1>The answers that looking for are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be found in your parents house.</v>

104
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could artificially maintain your</v>

105
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.020
<v Speaker 1>dependency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

106
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.510
<v Speaker 1>if you do that for too long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things get pretty ugly.</v>

107
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.520
<v Speaker 1>So you get pretty stale and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like bread that's been on the </v>

108
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>shelf for too long.</v>
