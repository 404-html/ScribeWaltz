1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Piaget was very interested in how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce structures that enable you to </v>

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:07.550
<v Speaker 1>regulate yourself because you're like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a,</v>

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.830
<v Speaker 1>a colony of strange sub animals that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to figure out how to get along so </v>

4
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.121
<v Speaker 1>that you can sort of be one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of learned that I would say </v>

5
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>between the ages of two and four as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being socialized,</v>

6
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:20.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how erratic two year olds are.</v>

7
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:25.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a blast and it's part because </v>

8
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:25.791
<v Speaker 1>they were erratic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're unbelievably happy and</v>

9
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>then they're unbelievably hungry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're really hot and then they're</v>

10
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>really upset and crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

11
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>And then they're really scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

12
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.790
<v Speaker 1>and all of that just untrammeled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's really fun to be around </v>

13
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.511
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're happy because </v>

14
00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:41.511
<v Speaker 1>they're so happy that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't ever get to be that happy.</v>

16
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.630
<v Speaker 1>And so it's nice to be around the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old because you can kinda feel that</v>

17
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of what the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the horrible things about being a</v>

19
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:56.091
<v Speaker 1>parent is that you spend a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of your time making your child </v>

20
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>less happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that positive</v>

21
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>emotion is a very impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>and you know because everybody says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>you should be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

24
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

25
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>when you're happy you're actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

26
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>And so because happiness makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>

27
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>happiness makes happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says,</v>

28
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are really good right now.</v>

29
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Get what you can while the getting's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

30
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And so as a like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're hyper optimistic,</v>

31
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 1>manic will say it's like every stock </v>
<v Speaker 1>investment looks like a really good </v>

32
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>stock investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you go to spend all your money</v>

33
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:32.421
<v Speaker 1>because look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's those wonderful things </v>

34
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:32.600
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and you could do such great </v>
<v Speaker 1>things with them and then you know,</v>

35
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>you spend all your money and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>crash and you think,</v>

36
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life's over,</v>

37
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just,</v>

38
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I just spent all my money on all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>useless stuff.</v>

39
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's all under the grip of </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>

40
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

41
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:52.011
<v Speaker 1>And so when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're telling your kids to be </v>

42
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>quiet and settled down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't because they're making a lot of</v>

43
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:59.121
<v Speaker 1>noise being in pain is because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>running around like wild baboons having </v>

44
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>a blast and disrupting things like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>you got kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to settle down,</v>

46
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:09.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like quit having so much fun and it's </v>

47
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>kind of awful that you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

48
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.610
<v Speaker 1>but you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because the emotions and the </v>

49
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.361
<v Speaker 1>motivations have to be brought into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with one another within the</v>

50
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

51
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing I remember with my son who is </v>

52
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's quite disagreeable by temperament,</v>

53
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a good thing as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned,</v>

54
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:34.491
<v Speaker 1>although it brings its own challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so with my daughter when she was </v>

55
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>misbehaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was pretty agreeable and uh,</v>

56
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she was misbehaving I could basically</v>

57
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:44.100
<v Speaker 1>just look at her and then she'd quit.</v>

58
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>But my son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

59
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>that was just nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at me.</v>

60
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

61
00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:53.931
<v Speaker 1>that's just not gonna go anywhere man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I'd tell them to stop and </v>

62
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:55.650
<v Speaker 1>that really wasn't having much of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect either.</v>

63
00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>He just sort of maybe laugh or runaway </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

64
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a tough little rat and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

65
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.960
<v Speaker 1>what I would do with him is he would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something and it interfered and </v>

66
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>he'd get upset and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>

67
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:13.531
<v Speaker 1>And so then I get them to sit on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>steps and I told them this is when he </v>

68
00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 1>was about to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

69
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to sit on the steps.</v>

70
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:20.041
<v Speaker 1>That's time out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to sit on the steps until </v>

71
00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:22.621
<v Speaker 1>you've got control of yourself and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can come back and be and play the game </v>

72
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically said,</v>

73
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>be a civilized human being and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're welcome again.</v>

74
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.210
<v Speaker 1>And so he'd sit on the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so interesting to watch because </v>

75
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>he was just enraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd sit there like,</v>

76
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen a two year old have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>temper tantrum?</v>

77
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>It's really quite the bloody phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever saw an adult do that,</v>

78
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>you'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd call nine one one right away.</v>

79
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

80
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>I've seen adults do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:50.461
<v Speaker 1>because people say with borderline </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality disorder will have temper </v>

82
00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>tantrums and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

83
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 1>you want to be about 30 feet away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person.</v>

84
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really.</v>

85
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>But in kids it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>

86
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:02.851
<v Speaker 1>they're only this long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much trouble can they really </v>

87
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:02.851
<v Speaker 1>cause?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

88
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just completely gone there.</v>

89
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Like on the floor of their face is red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just furious,</v>

90
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:12.811
<v Speaker 1>like way more furious than you ever get </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are even vaguely socialized </v>

91
00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just outraged.</v>

92
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.450
<v Speaker 1>And they're kicking and hitting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground and like it's like a little </v>

93
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>epileptic fit of anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>they're completely controlled by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>rage.</v>

95
00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:26.030
<v Speaker 1>And we took care of one kid for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>who he was actually a pushover,</v>

96
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 1>that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could get them to behave by,</v>

97
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of shaking your finger at him.</v>

98
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 1>But his mother thought he was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough because he had her,</v>

99
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>he had her figured out and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things he would do is have a temperature</v>

100
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>temper tantrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And during the temper Tantrum,</v>

101
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 1>he would hold his bloody breath until he</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned blue.</v>

102
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try that,</v>

103
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as that's your homework,</v>

104
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 1>go home and go home and have a temper </v>
<v Speaker 1>tantrum and while you're doing it,</v>

105
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:51.100
<v Speaker 1>hold your breath until you actually turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue.</v>

106
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like you won't be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the willpower of a two </v>

107
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.340
<v Speaker 1>year old now.</v>

108
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That little varmint man,</v>

109
00:04:56.981 --> 00:05:01.981
<v Speaker 1>he just have a fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he'd hold his breath and then he'd </v>

110
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:01.981
<v Speaker 1>turned blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

111
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:01.981
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

112
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:03.510
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we would just like,</v>

113
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.540
<v Speaker 1>let them do it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he turned blue and everybody would be </v>

114
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 1>gone and he'd come out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he just quit doing it.</v>

116
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>I think he did it like twice and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out,</v>

117
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:18.170
<v Speaker 1>oh well that's a lot of work for very </v>
<v Speaker 1>little outcome.</v>

118
00:05:18.171 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like two year olds are stupid.</v>

119
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>They're not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably smarter than you,</v>

120
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 1>but they're not civilized by any stretch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the imagination.</v>

121
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.480
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to my son,</v>

122
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I'd put them on the steps and he'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

123
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.180
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like aged and trying to get </v>

124
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.180
<v Speaker 1>himself together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

125
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And I wait a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>few,</v>

126
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I got a strict rule which was as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done,</v>

127
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 1>you're welcome again.</v>

128
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 1>So it's completely under your control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

129
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 1>you get yourself calmed down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come and talk to me again.</v>

130
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 1>If you're calm enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I like you,</v>

131
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 1>then you're welcome back in the family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No grudge or nothing.</v>

132
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>And so it's harder than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people think they liked their kids.</v>

133
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like don't be thinking that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to like they're little monsters and</v>

134
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very pushy and provocative.</v>

135
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.490
<v Speaker 1>And so lots of parents do not like their</v>
<v Speaker 1>children and they do terrible things to </v>

136
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 1>them their whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's no joke and it's a very common.</v>

137
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was Freud's observation,</v>

138
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:20.531
<v Speaker 1>fundamental observation that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology is rooted in the family </v>

139
00:06:20.531 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>and you can be sure of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when,</v>

140
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 1>when you hear about some mother who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>done something terrible to her child,</v>

141
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:30.881
<v Speaker 1>which happens reasonably frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know perfectly well that she has a </v>

142
00:06:30.881 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>very terrible capacity to discipline.</v>

143
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.060
<v Speaker 1>The child is just provoked or unprovoked</v>
<v Speaker 1>or provoked or unprovoked or provoked </v>

144
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.930
<v Speaker 1>her and it just happens to be a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>where her new boyfriend left and she's </v>

145
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.861
<v Speaker 1>quite hungover and she got fired and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's the wrong data </v>

146
00:06:44.861 --> 00:06:49.240
<v Speaker 1>provoker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then she does something that is not </v>

147
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.240
<v Speaker 1>good and you read about it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

148
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could that happen?</v>

149
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 1>How could anyone do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

150
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.880
<v Speaker 1>that's how they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so and kids are very provocative.</v>

151
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Just like little chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimps will.</v>

152
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.850
<v Speaker 1>The adolescents will like throw little </v>
<v Speaker 1>pebbles and sticks out the sleeping </v>

153
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.950
<v Speaker 1>larger males and bug them and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>teasing,</v>

154
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.980
<v Speaker 1>which it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that teasing turns into full fledged </v>

155
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.980
<v Speaker 1>dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged behavior.</v>

156
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Once the adolescent males get big enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it,</v>

157
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>and so when you're being provoked by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

158
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Speaker 1>which they provoke your time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to figure out,</v>

159
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:22.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just where are you exactly?</v>

160
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.040
<v Speaker 1>What happens if I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens if I do this,</v>

161
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how else are they going to figure it</v>

162
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

163
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:33.701
<v Speaker 1>he'd sit on the steps and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just enraged and trying to control </v>

164
00:07:33.701 --> 00:07:35.670
<v Speaker 1>himself and I've watched that and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I come back after about two minutes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever and he'd still be around.</v>

166
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well are,</v>

167
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

168
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.480
<v Speaker 1>have you got yourself under control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you ready to get off the steps?</v>

169
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

170
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

171
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd get himself under control and then </v>

172
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.991
<v Speaker 1>he'd come back and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be contrite and then I would like </v>

173
00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:55.991
<v Speaker 1>him right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

174
00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 1>you to watch that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:59.660
<v Speaker 1>because you don't like being dominated </v>
<v Speaker 1>by a two year old,</v>

176
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.720
<v Speaker 1>no one does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if the child hasn't mastered </v>

177
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.840
<v Speaker 1>himself and started to act in accordance</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the prevailing social norms,</v>

178
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.390
<v Speaker 1>you won't like them while you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

179
00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I will because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a good person.</v>

180
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

181
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:15.440
<v Speaker 1>you won't and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a good person.</v>

182
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>So don't be thinking about that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not true.</v>

183
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.200
<v Speaker 1>So when he was contrite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he'd come and then we just go on </v>

184
00:08:23.511 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>like nothing had happened because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to do,</v>

185
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:28.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you get compliance,</v>

186
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 1>especially if the compliance is in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best interest of the child,</v>

187
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.680
<v Speaker 1>you want to reward it instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

188
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the right thing to do because so </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

189
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 1>and you could just see him gaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>control over himself.</v>

190
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:45.020
<v Speaker 1>And so really what was happening is his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his mind,</v>

191
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.310
<v Speaker 1>in his brain will say there was a war </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the psyche,</v>

192
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:54.311
<v Speaker 1>the ego that was starting to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated and starting to become a </v>

193
00:08:54.311 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>continuous person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an identity,</v>

194
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's fragile in two year olds and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be disrupted all the time.</v>

195
00:08:59.281 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>And it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're so hyper emotional.</v>

196
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:06.771
<v Speaker 1>It's fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little ego and it doesn't have a </v>

197
00:09:06.771 --> 00:09:09.561
<v Speaker 1>lot of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you want to do is reward it </v>

198
00:09:09.561 --> 00:09:09.561
<v Speaker 1>when it wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

199
00:09:09.561 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>it's when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he gets control over the underlying</v>

200
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:12.990
<v Speaker 1>motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to say,</v>

201
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good work man,</v>

202
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 1>good work kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did it.</v>

203
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got yourself under control way to </v>

204
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.241
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the kids really happy about that </v>

205
00:09:23.241 --> 00:09:23.430
<v Speaker 1>because it's actually not that much fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a temper tantrum.</v>

206
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 1>It's exhausting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

207
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 1>it takes you over.</v>
