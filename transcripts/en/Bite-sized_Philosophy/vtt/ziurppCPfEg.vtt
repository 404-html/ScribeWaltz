00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.990
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental assumptions of Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization are valid.</v>

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.190
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

4
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.110
<v Speaker 1>You think it's an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:15.760
<v Speaker 1>here's how you find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

6
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Which countries do people want to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from?</v>

7
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not ours.</v>

8
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Which countries do people want to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours.</v>

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They work better and it's not because we</v>

10
00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:29.170
<v Speaker 1>went around the world stealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

11
00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:32.920
<v Speaker 1>We could get our hands on it because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>got certain fundamental assumptions.</v>

12
00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God for that.</v>

13
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.560
<v Speaker 1>After thousands and thousands of years </v>
<v Speaker 1>of trying and because of that,</v>

14
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:42.880
<v Speaker 1>we've managed to establish a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations that are shining lights in</v>

15
00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:44.020
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:47.920
<v Speaker 1>now you can be pretty damn filthy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>still be a shining light in this world,</v>

17
00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:52.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you look around the world at </v>

18
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:55.021
<v Speaker 1>the state of governance in most places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the most pathological corrupt </v>

19
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 1>and vicious thugs rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to stand out as an illuminated light</v>

20
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 1>against that background is it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult?</v>

21
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.350
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 1>we're as good as it's gone and unless we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can come up with something better,</v>

23
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:08.950
<v Speaker 1>we should be very careful about messing </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with that.</v>

24
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>So why don't we start with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption that we're doing something </v>

25
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we're doing right,</v>

26
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.391
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we actually value the </v>

27
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:18.391
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

28
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>The individual has intrinsic value in </v>
<v Speaker 1>western societies.</v>

29
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how long it took people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate that as an idea and how </v>

30
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.280
<v Speaker 1>unlikely that ideas that poor you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 1>useless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerless you with all your damn fault,</v>

32
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 1>you're actually worth something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're worth something to the point that</v>

33
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 1>the law has to respect you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

34
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to abandon that for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>half witted collectivism,</v>

35
00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:46.651
<v Speaker 1>which we're doing as rapidly as possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that </v>

36
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:49.900
<v Speaker 1>characterizes the radical left types is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't give a damn about you as an </v>

37
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.190
<v Speaker 1>individual or about individuals at all.</v>

38
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.240
<v Speaker 1>You're black or you're white or you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latino or you're transsexual,</v>

39
00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>you're homosexual or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a group.</v>

40
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>You're a member of a group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only thing that matters is the </v>

41
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you if the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters is the group,</v>

43
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>you bloody well don't matter very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got to ask yourself just</v>

44
00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:12.520
<v Speaker 1>exactly what sort of people are trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to set things up.</v>

45
00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:16.360
<v Speaker 1>So it is that the individual doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter very much.</v>

46
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the sort of people to whom the </v>

47
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.551
<v Speaker 1>individual doesn't matter very much and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I might suggest that you don't elect </v>

48
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:27.541
<v Speaker 1>them and that when they attempt to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>power that you do everything you can to </v>

49
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:27.541
<v Speaker 1>stop them.</v>
