1
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.130
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I would say is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with someone who's </v>

2
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.500
<v Speaker 1>depressed and they're really depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should try giving him </v>

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants because if they die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't help them.</v>

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're suffering,</v>

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.680
<v Speaker 1>you are obligated in a sense to hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto whatever roped someone throws you,</v>

6
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things I do with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>clients all the time,</v>

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're really in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to tell them,</v>

8
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:31.851
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what's going to </v>

9
00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Speaker 1>help you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't arbitrarily throw out any </v>

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.711
<v Speaker 1>possibilities because you might not have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that luxury and antidepressants help a </v>

11
00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>lot of people and there are technical </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why that's the case.</v>

12
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.910
<v Speaker 1>So that's a simple answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not relevant to what I already </v>

13
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 1>described except that if you're offered </v>
<v Speaker 1>a gift by your society and it works,</v>

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160
<v Speaker 1>try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what your presuppositions </v>

15
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.160
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

16
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Apart from that,</v>

17
00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>lots of lots of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of the time you see people who are </v>

18
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>suffering with depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

19
00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a multitude of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll take one common reason,</v>

20
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could think about it as associated </v>

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.461
<v Speaker 1>with the story of Peter Pan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Pan is someone who won't grow up </v>

22
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:12.490
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with Peter Pan is he gets to</v>

23
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:14.650
<v Speaker 1>be king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's King of Neverland.</v>

24
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Neverland doesn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so being king of nothing isn't that </v>

25
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.380
<v Speaker 1>helpful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:25.381
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you often see </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people who suffer from depression </v>

27
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>and and and not making a blanket </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement about the cause of depression </v>

28
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.711
<v Speaker 1>because there's lots of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people who don't have enough </v>

29
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:32.020
<v Speaker 1>order in their life tend to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed.</v>

30
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone comes into me and see to see </v>

31
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.591
<v Speaker 1>me and they say they're depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always asked him a very standard set </v>

32
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 1>of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a job?</v>

33
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really in trouble in our society.</v>

34
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

35
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.460
<v Speaker 1>your biological rhythms stand to go off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rails right away because there's no </v>

36
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>reason to go to bed at any particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and there's no reason to get up.</v>

37
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:55.310
<v Speaker 1>And for many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't get up at the same time,</v>

38
00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.610
<v Speaker 1>they follow up the functioning of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>circadian rhythms and that's enough to </v>

39
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.851
<v Speaker 1>make them depressed right off the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if they start napping during </v>

40
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:04.460
<v Speaker 1>the afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also don't have a purpose.</v>

41
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>People aren't good without a purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't.</v>

42
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.190
<v Speaker 1>This isn't hypothesizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We absolutely understand the circuitry </v>

43
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 1>that underlies positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know how it works.</v>

44
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Almost all the positive emotion that any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you are likely to experience in your </v>

45
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>life will not be a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attaining things.</v>

46
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Speaker 1>It will be a consequence of seeing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are working as you proceed </v>

47
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>towards a goal you value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's completely different and you need</v>

48
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:30.440
<v Speaker 1>to know this because people are often </v>
<v Speaker 1>stunned.</v>

49
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.170
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they finished their phd thesis and their</v>

50
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:38.171
<v Speaker 1>presupposition is that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be elated for a month and often instead </v>

51
00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:38.710
<v Speaker 1>they're actually depressed and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

52
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell I'd been working on this for seven </v>

53
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.060
<v Speaker 1>years and I handed it in and what do I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do now?</v>

54
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:45.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's what depresses them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

55
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:46.790
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I do now?</v>

56
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're are fine.</v>

57
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.790
<v Speaker 1>If they enjoyed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing the thing,</v>

58
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 1>as long as it was working out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a lot of enthusiasm and </v>

59
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 1>excitement over that because that's how </v>
<v Speaker 1>our nervous systems work.</v>

60
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Most of your positive emotion is goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit.</v>

61
00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:02.711
<v Speaker 1>Emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If take drugs like cocaine or </v>

62
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:05.191
<v Speaker 1>amphetamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason they're enjoyable is because </v>

63
00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:05.191
<v Speaker 1>they turn on the systems that help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue goals.</v>

64
00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>That's why people like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't have a job,</v>

65
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>you got no structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

66
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Plus you tend not to have a point.</v>

67
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.340
<v Speaker 1>So you're overwhelmed by chaotic lack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and you don't have any </v>

68
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.340
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.661
<v Speaker 1>do you have any friends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes you see people who are </v>

70
00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:21.661
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no job,</v>

71
00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>they have no friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no intimate relationship,</v>

72
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.350
<v Speaker 1>they have an additional health problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have a drug and alcohol </v>

73
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My experience has been,</v>

74
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>if you have three of those problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to help you.</v>

75
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.490
<v Speaker 1>You're so deeply mired in chaos that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get out because you make progress </v>

76
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 1>on one front and one of your other </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems pulls you down.</v>

77
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.200
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I tell people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are depressed is like,</v>

78
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>don't sacrifice your stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a job.</v>

79
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's not the job you exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

80
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>get a damn job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a job.</v>

81
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Find some friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out in the dating circuit,</v>

82
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>see if you can establish an intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

83
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 1>put together some of the foundation </v>
<v Speaker 1>litems that,</v>

84
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 1>that are like pillars that you're life </v>
<v Speaker 1>rests on.</v>

85
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the practical thing to do.</v>

86
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>So that's one example with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

87
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is you don't just launch it on</v>

88
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.100
<v Speaker 1>you got to negotiate with the person and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also got to teach them to negotiate </v>

90
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 1>with themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that's very useful</v>

91
00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 1>to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:27.361
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tyrannized yourself into doing </v>

93
00:04:27.361 --> 00:04:27.361
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't recommend it.</v>

94
00:04:27.361 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 1>What I would recommend instead is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you ask yourself what you're willing to </v>

95
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.510
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really effective technique.</v>

96
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like a meditative techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

97
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>you can get up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take,</v>

98
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to have a good day to day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd like to go to bed tonight without</v>

100
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>feeling guilty because I didn't do some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things I said I was going to do and I,</v>

101
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to have kind of an interesting </v>

102
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.021
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to fulfill my </v>

103
00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:49.021
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I want to,</v>

104
00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:49.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy the day.</v>

105
00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Then you can ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

106
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.600
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would I have to do in order for </v>

107
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>that to happen that I would do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the probability if you practice this</v>

108
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 1>for three or four days is your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>will just tell you.</v>

109
00:04:58.091 --> 00:04:58.510
<v Speaker 1>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

110
00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:03.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that piece of homework that you </v>

111
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:03.511
<v Speaker 1>haven't done for like three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should knock that sucker off because</v>

112
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:07.531
<v Speaker 1>it will only take you 10 minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been avoiding it and torturing </v>

113
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:08.020
<v Speaker 1>yourself to death for like 72 hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>

114
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:13.021
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a little interesting thing you </v>

115
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:13.021
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

116
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is a little obligations you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should clean up.</v>

117
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:18.511
<v Speaker 1>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do in a situation like that as </v>

118
00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:19.950
<v Speaker 1>you teach the person to negotiate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves say,</v>

119
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Speaker 1>well let's figure out what your aims </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

120
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>You going to have some ames,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they are.</v>

121
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>And they might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

122
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm so depressed I don't have any aims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I say,</v>

123
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick the least objectionable of the Ames</v>

124
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 1>and act it out for awhile and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

125
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:36.061
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes your emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your emotional systems are so followed </v>

126
00:05:36.061 --> 00:05:39.511
<v Speaker 1>up that you have to pretend you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act the thing out before you can start </v>

127
00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

128
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:42.000
<v Speaker 1>people always assume they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in Vanap,</v>

129
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's sometimes that's true in lots</v>

130
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>

131
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.640
<v Speaker 1>So the trick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing therapeutic work with </v>

132
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.640
<v Speaker 1>somebody and you're helping them </v>
<v Speaker 1>establish a structure,</v>

133
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>is to find out what they'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

134
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.360
<v Speaker 1>if they want to get better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not a given because there are </v>

135
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 1>often payoffs for not getting better </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

136
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.300
<v Speaker 1>That's basically the payoffs of being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>martyr or maybe the payoffs of doing </v>

137
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.691
<v Speaker 1>what you're entirely pathological family</v>
<v Speaker 1>members want you to do because they </v>

138
00:06:07.691 --> 00:06:07.691
<v Speaker 1>actually want you to fail.</v>

139
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Assuming you want to get better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's usually something you can figure</v>

140
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 1>out that would constitute a step toward </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of concrete goal.</v>

141
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.470
<v Speaker 1>And my presumption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a behavior of presumptions </v>

142
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.350
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally is that small accruing </v>
<v Speaker 1>gains that repeat unbelievably powerful.</v>

143
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.190
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is another thing to know about in </v>

144
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.011
<v Speaker 1>your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something I learned in part from </v>

145
00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:33.011
<v Speaker 1>reading the writings of Aleksandr </v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn.</v>

146
00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>He was a great Russian philosopher and </v>
<v Speaker 1>novelist,</v>

147
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said you can look at your life and </v>

148
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 1>you can see what isn't right about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know you have to do is look,</v>

149
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.940
<v Speaker 1>and then you can start to fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way you fix it is by noticing </v>

150
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>what you could in fact fix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 1>people are often trying to fix things </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can fix,</v>

152
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 1>which I would not recommend because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to fix something you can't text,</v>

153
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>you'll just ruin it.</v>

154
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Like you can find all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates who are perfectly willing</v>

155
00:06:57.471 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 1>to restructure the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

156
00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:04.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the international economic system who </v>

157
00:07:04.121 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>cannot keep the room clean and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a gap there,</v>

158
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

159
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:08.210
<v Speaker 1>and it's surprising that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually notice.</v>

160
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>So I would say if you pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see things that you could fix.</v>

161
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.000
<v Speaker 1>They yell at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really do.</v>

162
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.850
<v Speaker 1>We even know how that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

163
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 1>let me give you an example because rooms</v>
<v Speaker 1>are full of stories and the stories have</v>

164
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.050
<v Speaker 1>have effects on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's a classic experiment.</v>

165
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.630
<v Speaker 1>So you take two groups of </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates,</v>

166
00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>you bring them into your lab and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>give one group on a multiple choice test</v>

167
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.830
<v Speaker 1>that has a bunch of words in it that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with being old and you give </v>

168
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.311
<v Speaker 1>the other group the same multiple choice</v>
<v Speaker 1>test except the words are associated </v>

169
00:07:39.311 --> 00:07:39.311
<v Speaker 1>with being young.</v>

170
00:07:39.311 --> 00:07:40.640
<v Speaker 1>This is independent of the content of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the test.</v>

171
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just descriptions and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

172
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 1>The undergraduate says they walked back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the elevators,</v>

173
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.160
<v Speaker 1>the ones who read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones who completed the multiple </v>

174
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.160
<v Speaker 1>choice tests that had more words </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with aging,</v>

175
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.650
<v Speaker 1>walk slower back to the elevators and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know that and they don't know</v>

176
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it and that that study has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been replicated in various forms.</v>

177
00:07:58.221 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times.</v>

178
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:04.271
<v Speaker 1>You're unbelievably sensitive to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story that your environment is telling </v>

179
00:08:04.271 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 1>you because your environment is not made</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of objects.</v>

180
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:10.090
<v Speaker 1>That's just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your environment is basically made out </v>

181
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>of something like tools and obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a tool using creature.</v>

182
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.550
<v Speaker 1>You a tool perceiving creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things you like.</v>

183
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:14.860
<v Speaker 1>If I take you out of this room and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

184
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was in the room?</v>

185
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.100
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>random patterns in the carpet because </v>

187
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:22.820
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're real or just as good an object.</v>

188
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to say chairs because you </v>

189
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.500
<v Speaker 1>can sit on them and you're going to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>handrails because you can hold them.</v>

190
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:29.570
<v Speaker 1>You can say stairs because you can walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>down them.</v>

191
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.990
<v Speaker 1>That's what you see and that's what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with and if you'll pay </v>

192
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:34.990
<v Speaker 1>attention to your environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you,</v>

193
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.280
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extended all of your experiences,</v>

194
00:08:37.281 --> 00:08:42.281
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will tell you all the time what you </v>

195
00:08:42.281 --> 00:08:42.281
<v Speaker 1>should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is do it,</v>

196
00:08:42.281 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 1>but then you have to decide if you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

197
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.280
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I've noticed about </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because I've wondered once I </v>

198
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.830
<v Speaker 1>started studying this mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories and I got this idea about the,</v>

199
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:55.130
<v Speaker 1>the fact that life can be meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to justify it suffering.</v>

200
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

201
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 1>that's such a good idea because it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic.</v>

202
00:08:58.291 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

203
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>some people will tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be happy.</v>

204
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like those people are idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

205
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:08.421
<v Speaker 1>they're idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be things that come </v>

206
00:09:08.421 --> 00:09:09.570
<v Speaker 1>along that flat new so hard you won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it and you're not happy then,</v>

207
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and so if life is to be happy while in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those situations,</v>

208
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why even live,</v>

209
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.770
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life isn't to be happy.</v>

210
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:21.771
<v Speaker 1>If you're happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're bloody fortunate and you should </v>

211
00:09:21.771 --> 00:09:23.811
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should because it's the grace of </v>

212
00:09:23.811 --> 00:09:23.811
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

213
00:09:23.811 --> 00:09:25.770
<v Speaker 1>With regards to meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

214
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people know when they're doing something</v>

215
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:28.950
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can tell,</v>

216
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 1>so why the hell don't they do meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 1>things all the time?</v>

217
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 1>It seems obvious you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's hard,</v>

218
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:39.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because other people want you to do </v>

219
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.121
<v Speaker 1>other things and it's a struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everything's a struggle and then I </v>

220
00:09:41.121 --> 00:09:41.121
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

221
00:09:41.121 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

222
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I see why it took me about 10 years to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure this out.</v>

223
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.530
<v Speaker 1>People have a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Choice number one,</v>

224
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.140
<v Speaker 1>nothing you do means anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

225
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:50.370
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a drag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

226
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Meaninglessness of life and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential angst,</v>

227
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a pain,</v>

228
00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.080
<v Speaker 1>but the upside of nothing that you do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful is you don't have to do </v>

229
00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:02.400
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got no responsibility.</v>

230
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:07.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to suffer because things are </v>

231
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.961
<v Speaker 1>meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a small price to pay for </v>

232
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:09.930
<v Speaker 1>being able to be completely useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The alternative,</v>

233
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.900
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is everything you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

234
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you make a mistake,</v>

235
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a real mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you'd be traced someone,</v>

236
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you tilt the world a little more sharply</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards evil rather than good.</v>

237
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.900
<v Speaker 1>It matters what you do well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you buy that,</v>

238
00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:28.380
<v Speaker 1>then you can have a meaningful life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no mucking around.</v>

239
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.430
<v Speaker 1>It means responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that the decisions you make are</v>

240
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:37.431
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that when you do something </v>

241
00:10:37.431 --> 00:10:37.431
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong.</v>

242
00:10:37.431 --> 00:10:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want that.</v>
