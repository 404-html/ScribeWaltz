1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>What the hell address the Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 1>question?</v>

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.280
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a thing to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's Jacqueline.</v>

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really that's a hell of a thing </v>

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.470
<v Speaker 1>to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will say something about it.</v>

6
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought about this a lot.</v>

7
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>So there is evidence that Ashkenazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews,</v>

8
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>so those are Jews of European heritage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have iqs that are about 15 points higher</v>

9
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 1>than the population average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a lot.</v>

10
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.730
<v Speaker 1>15 points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the average difference </v>

11
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>between the typical high school student </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the typical state college student.</v>

12
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that means is,</v>

13
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:37.221
<v Speaker 1>so imagine there's two distributions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they overlap and that the Jewish </v>

14
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:37.221
<v Speaker 1>one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.560
<v Speaker 1>is the mean is 1:15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the whole distribution has shifted to</v>

16
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that means is if you go up into the</v>

17
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Higher Iq strata,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1:30,</v>

18
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>1:45</v>
<v Speaker 1>way the hell up there,</v>

19
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.010
<v Speaker 1>that Jewish people are overwhelmingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>overrepresented at the high end of the </v>

20
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.010
<v Speaker 1>ICU distribution.</v>

21
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Now the price they pay for that is some </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased propensity for neurological </v>

22
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>diseases that seems to be associated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense with that heightened Iq.</v>

23
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the science on this isn't settled but,</v>

24
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonably solid.</v>

25
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>It given the standards of such things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

26
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:18.261
<v Speaker 1>so Jews are going to be our over </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented at the high end of </v>

27
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>cognitively complex disciplines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I would say,</v>

28
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.290
<v Speaker 1>and that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're way over represented among </v>

29
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>like outstanding scientists and among </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobel Prize winners and and so forth.</v>

30
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people look and they think,</v>

31
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:35.811
<v Speaker 1>well why are there a disproportionate </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of Jewish people in positions of </v>

32
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:35.811
<v Speaker 1>authority?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

33
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be a conspiracy.</v>

34
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be systemic in some sense.</v>

35
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

36
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>it can be simply accounted for by that </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively large ICU differential.</v>

37
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Now the next criticism would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>don't the Jews tend to lean left?</v>

39
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Well first you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

40
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given what happened in Nazi Germany to </v>

41
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>the degree that that was right wing as </v>
<v Speaker 1>we discussed earlier,</v>

42
00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>that's the nationalism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnocentrism.</v>

43
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>It's hardly surprising that they might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>in this historical period of time tend </v>
<v Speaker 1>to move towards the left,</v>

45
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq is associated with trait,</v>

46
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Speaker 1>openness and trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Openness is a strong predictor predictor</v>

47
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>of political liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

48
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>and it's the strongest predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>political liberalism.</v>

49
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I have to say about that.</v>

51
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing I would say is,</v>

52
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there is a population of </v>

53
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>subpopulation of people who are much </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter than average,</v>

54
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>not on average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

55
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>On average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get that straight on average</v>

56
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:45.591
<v Speaker 1>is actually a great benefit to the rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of us because why do you want fewer </v>

57
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>geniuses?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fewer people with Iqs of 145 or 160.</v>

58
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.470
<v Speaker 1>That's and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's no conspiracy that puts people </v>

59
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.941
<v Speaker 1>who are smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher up in competence hierarchies </v>

60
00:02:58.941 --> 00:03:02.091
<v Speaker 1>because I accused the best predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement in a complex carb competence </v>

61
00:03:02.091 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>

62
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:08.071
<v Speaker 1>I've addressed the Jewish question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a confusion between </v>

63
00:03:08.071 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity and and ICU as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

64
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.570
<v Speaker 1>So I'll probably get like painted six </v>
<v Speaker 1>different shades of black for that </v>

65
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

66
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best that I can manage.</v>
