1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Book called a billion wicked thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was written by a bunch of engineers</v>

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>at Google and they were looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of search,</v>

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of google searches and you </v>

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.951
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no shortage of pornography on </v>

5
00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>the Internet and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's much less by proportion than</v>

6
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>there was when the Internet was first </v>
<v Speaker 1>invented.</v>

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's so interesting because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually turned out that one of the </v>

8
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.211
<v Speaker 1>things that drove the development of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet and the technology was the </v>

9
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Speaker 1>proclivity of young men to search out </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually provocative images.</v>

10
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>That was what was at the forefront of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the development of the nets.</v>

11
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Extraordinarily interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were motivated to,</v>

12
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>they were motivated to use it for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

13
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>And that provided the platform from </v>
<v Speaker 1>which it emerged.</v>

14
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

15
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.550
<v Speaker 1>the Google engineers looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>pornographic search processes and then </v>

16
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>segregated male searches from female </v>
<v Speaker 1>searches.</v>

17
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:58.071
<v Speaker 1>And what they found was that the mail </v>
<v Speaker 1>search out images probably surprise no </v>

18
00:00:58.071 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one considers that,</v>

19
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly interesting.</v>

20
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>But the female searched out literary </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of pornography.</v>

21
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>It was written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example of that.</v>

22
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>If you know about harlequin romances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does everybody still know about those?</v>

23
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Anybody not know about those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:17.901
<v Speaker 1>Well there are mass market romances and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a very stereotypical type and </v>

25
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The original ones were pretty harmless </v>

26
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>in terms of no violence and no real </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual contact con content,</v>

27
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.710
<v Speaker 1>but that was 40 years ago and they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated tremendously and now </v>

28
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>there's hardcore harlequin romances and </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

29
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>with particularly garish covers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the old,</v>

30
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more tame basic sexless and aggression </v>

31
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.240
<v Speaker 1>list romances where everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>implied and not explicit,</v>

32
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>but the explicit ones exist.</v>

33
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>So they did a plot analysis of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical pornographic female fantasy.</v>

34
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was.</v>

35
00:01:56.191 --> 00:02:01.191
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so comical because engineers did </v>

36
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:03.381
<v Speaker 1>this and social scientists would never </v>
<v Speaker 1>do this because they'd be probably too </v>

37
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>concerned about the ethics of it or some</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn thing.</v>

38
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.440
<v Speaker 1>But engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>they'll just plow ahead with no concern </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever for such things and they </v>

40
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>actually discover things that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

41
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Speaker 1>they discovered the basic plot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>female pornographic literary product and</v>

42
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 1>they identified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what happened was that a </v>

43
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 1>innocent well meaning and attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>young woman encounters a male who's a </v>

44
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.201
<v Speaker 1>bit of a monster and the monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's five types of classic male </v>

45
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:37.341
<v Speaker 1>monster for all your males who want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know this is what you can become a </v>

46
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 1>vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

47
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.340
<v Speaker 1>We're wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaire pirate and surgeon.</v>

48
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's very interesting because.</v>

49
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all there's a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

50
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're actually blushing.</v>

51
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually blushing about that.</v>

52
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>That's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very funny.</v>

53
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.310
<v Speaker 1>So sorry to point it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so comical,</v>

54
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

55
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>

56
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I was reading this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading this.</v>

57
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>It was just cracking me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

58
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

59
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Pirate Vampire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that explains it.</v>

60
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.140
<v Speaker 1>What about all these damn vampire shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there?</v>

61
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>So popular online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are so popular on Netflix.</v>

62
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the war wolf.</v>

63
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing sexier than a werewolf </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently,</v>

64
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's predatory dope.</v>

65
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:24.720
<v Speaker 1>There's predatory dominance that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit in that,</v>

66
00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With a billionaire,</v>

67
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>it's more abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but clearly that's an indication of very</v>

68
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>high success in the male dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

69
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:36.721
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's this desire for aggression </v>

70
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>that's in that are real aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

71
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.500
<v Speaker 1>and it's not surprising to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me at all,</v>

72
00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:42.290
<v Speaker 1>it makes perfect sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>

73
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.360
<v Speaker 1>But the basic plot is that the woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounters this mysterious and </v>

74
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.920
<v Speaker 1>aggressive male and teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the female hero myth as far as I </v>

75
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:59.971
<v Speaker 1>can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beauty and the beast and so it's </v>

76
00:03:59.971 --> 00:04:01.340
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.380
<v Speaker 1>there's no fun in taming someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>already tame and what makes you think </v>

78
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>you really want someone who's taken many</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

79
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>There's no interest in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus when,</v>

80
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when chaos manifests itself,</v>

81
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.270
<v Speaker 1>what makes you think that someone tame </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be good for anything and </v>

82
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a real question and so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression is absolutely vital.</v>

83
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:25.921
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because it's in incredibly </v>

84
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course it is,</v>

85
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.770
<v Speaker 1>it has to be civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that the </v>

86
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>archetypal female in these pornographic </v>
<v Speaker 1>romances,</v>

87
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>seduces and tames,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aggressive male,</v>

88
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>and that's her encounter with chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's more,</v>

89
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 1>it's more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

90
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:47.521
<v Speaker 1>females,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more complicated and that's </v>

91
00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:49.231
<v Speaker 1>exactly how it is and it's no wonder </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there their lives are more </v>

92
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:49.231
<v Speaker 1>complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but okay.</v>
