1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Endosteal eskies book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crime and punishment.</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.030
<v Speaker 1>He has his main character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] cove decides that he's going</v>

3
00:00:08.031 --> 00:00:11.370
<v Speaker 1>to commit a murder and he has very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>justification for the murder.</v>

4
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>And Dostoevsky is very good at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.470
<v Speaker 1>he puts his characters into very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult moral situations and </v>

6
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>gives them full justification for </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing the,</v>

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.300
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>pursuing the pathway that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing.</v>

9
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:39.330
<v Speaker 1>And so [inaudible] cove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's broke and starving.</v>

10
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>He wants to go to law school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His sister's about to prostitute herself</v>

11
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:47.421
<v Speaker 1>rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking by marrying a guy that </v>

12
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:47.421
<v Speaker 1>hates her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she hates and that,</v>

13
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>and he has contempt for her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least acts in that manner.</v>

14
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to rescue his mother as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

15
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 1>who's also in dire financial straits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

16
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

17
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.840
<v Speaker 1>he goes to a pawnbroker to pawn his </v>
<v Speaker 1>meager position so that he can continue </v>

18
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>to scrape by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she has this nice,</v>

19
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's her niece that's not very</v>

20
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:10.221
<v Speaker 1>bright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who she basically treats us as a slave </v>

21
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:10.221
<v Speaker 1>in his horrible too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

22
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>and so the care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pawn broker has this money risk.</v>

23
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>All Niqab is in dire need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks,</v>

24
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.810
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just killer because why the hell </v>

25
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.420
<v Speaker 1>not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take her money.</v>

26
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>She's not doing any good with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

27
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll free or niece who's just working as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slave.</v>

28
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>She's got all these other people tangled</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in her pawnbroker schemes.</v>

29
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.880
<v Speaker 1>All that will happen is the world will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a better place and the only thing </v>

30
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.141
<v Speaker 1>that's holding me back is conventional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moral cowardice and Dostoevsky has his </v>

31
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>character in crime and punishment go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through days,</v>

32
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.500
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours and days and weeks of intense </v>

33
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>imagination about this rationalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

34
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>trying to justify himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>placing a metal outside,</v>

35
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>placing him self outside the law so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can perpetrate this act and telling </v>

36
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.341
<v Speaker 1>him self with all the best nihilistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments that the only possible thing </v>

37
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:08.601
<v Speaker 1>that could be holding them back is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary sense of indoctrinated </v>

38
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:13.041
<v Speaker 1>morality and so dusty Esky explorers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he does commit the murder and then </v>

39
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:17.031
<v Speaker 1>of course all hell breaks loose because </v>
<v Speaker 1>things don't necessarily turn out the </v>

40
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:17.031
<v Speaker 1>way that you want.</v>

41
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>He gets away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

42
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>while he gets away with a technically </v>
<v Speaker 1>because no one knows he did it,</v>

43
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.970
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't get away with it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to his own conscience and </v>

44
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>so that the rest of the book explores </v>
<v Speaker 1>that well,</v>

45
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:32.331
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was in crime and </v>

46
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:32.331
<v Speaker 1>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he makes the same point in many</v>

47
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:37.041
<v Speaker 1>of his books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes a very fundamental point and </v>

48
00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:39.861
<v Speaker 1>this is the kind of point that that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that people who haven't </v>

49
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:43.851
<v Speaker 1>investigated these matters down this </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly particular literary and </v>

50
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 1>philosophical pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never grappled with Dostoevsky,</v>

51
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>said straightforwardly if there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

52
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.700
<v Speaker 1>so if there's no higher value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say if there's no transcendent </v>

53
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.101
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can do whatever you want and </v>

54
00:02:58.101 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>that's the question that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigating.</v>

55
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.050
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why I have such frustration say </v>

56
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.021
<v Speaker 1>with people like Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of radical atheists because </v>

57
00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>they seem to think that once human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings abandoned their,</v>

58
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>their grounding in the transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

59
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 1>the plausible way forward is with a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of purest rationality that automatically</v>

60
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>attributes to other people equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

61
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like I just don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they believe that that's the rational</v>

62
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:29.251
<v Speaker 1>pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is irrational about me </v>

63
00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.831
<v Speaker 1>getting exactly what I want from every </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of you whenever I wanted at every </v>

64
00:03:31.831 --> 00:03:35.881
<v Speaker 1>possible second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that are irrational and how </v>

65
00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:39.691
<v Speaker 1>possibly is that more irrational than us</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperating so we can both have a good </v>

66
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>time of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

67
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's as if the psychopathic </v>
<v Speaker 1>tendency is irrational.</v>

68
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing irrational about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pure naked self interest.</v>

69
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>How is that irrational?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

70
00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Where?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the pathway from rationality to </v>

71
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>to an egalitarianism virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why the hell not every man for himself </v>

72
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.160
<v Speaker 1>and the devil take the hindmost?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfectly coherent philosophy and</v>

73
00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 1>is actually one that you can institute </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world with a fair bit of material</v>

74
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>success if you want to do it so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

75
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.220
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that the universe that </v>

76
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.161
<v Speaker 1>people like Dorkins and Harris inhabit </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so intensely conditioned by </v>

77
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>mythological presuppositions that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>take for granted.</v>

78
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>The ethic that emerges out of that as if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a given,</v>

79
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 1>a rational given,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this of course precisely niches,</v>

80
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:40.180
<v Speaker 1>observation as well as Dostoyevsky's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Nietzsche's observation.</v>

81
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ethic that you think is normative is</v>

82
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:49.471
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of its of its of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>nesting inside this tremendously lengthy</v>

83
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:54.781
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of which was expressed in </v>

84
00:04:54.781 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>mythological formulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wipe that out.</v>

85
00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.270
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to keep all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions and just assume that </v>

86
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.141
<v Speaker 1>they're rationally axiomatic there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rational to make a rational </v>

87
00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:09.121
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to start with an initial </v>

88
00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:11.640
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the proposition that underlies </v>

89
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>western culture is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent morality.</v>

90
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Now you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a transcendent morality </v>

91
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.200
<v Speaker 1>instantiated in the figure of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

92
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.510
<v Speaker 1>You can even call that a personification</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the morality if you want to,</v>

93
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.680
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want to move into a </v>

94
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.371
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not arguing for the existence of </v>

95
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:32.191
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm arguing that the ethic that drives </v>

96
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.770
<v Speaker 1>our culture is predicated on the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>God and that you can't just take that </v>

97
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:42.931
<v Speaker 1>idea away and expect the thing to remain</v>
<v Speaker 1>intact midair without any foundational </v>

98
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>
