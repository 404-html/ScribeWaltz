00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.860
<v Speaker 1>What's the alternative given that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a point,</v>

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>while as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is a proper return to </v>

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>the past and that is precisely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey into the chaos,</v>

4
00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:17.951
<v Speaker 1>to look at the worst possible thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull the dead father up from the </v>

5
00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:20.450
<v Speaker 1>chaotic depths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you stop being a puppet.</v>

6
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Someone whose strings are being pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>by forces they do not understand behind </v>

7
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.530
<v Speaker 1>the scenes,</v>

8
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.740
<v Speaker 1>you find out what's great about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

9
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.280
<v Speaker 1>this thing that's provided us with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that we see in this room,</v>

10
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:38.210
<v Speaker 1>this amazing warmth that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing when it's 30 bloody below,</v>

11
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:43.211
<v Speaker 1>outside the fact that the electricity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart and the computational </v>

12
00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:46.691
<v Speaker 1>resources are working and that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sit here peacefully and then no one </v>

13
00:00:46.691 --> 00:00:46.970
<v Speaker 1>is hungry fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're too fat.</v>

14
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.340
<v Speaker 1>That's our big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

15
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.310
<v Speaker 1>we have so much stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting fat.</v>

16
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a good problem to have.</v>

17
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>We should have some gratitude for what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>being produced that's brought us to this</v>

18
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 1>point and we need to wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what we're doing.</v>

19
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what.</v>

20
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.160
<v Speaker 1>That's what people like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the psychoanalysts were </v>

21
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.891
<v Speaker 1>trying to do in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what all the great clinicians </v>

22
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:14.711
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to do and I would say above</v>
<v Speaker 1>all else that was what Carl young was </v>

23
00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:14.711
<v Speaker 1>trying to do.</v>

24
00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:19.570
<v Speaker 1>He believed firmly that the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>divine spark within the individual was </v>

25
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:24.581
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a metaphysical reality by which he </v>

26
00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:27.401
<v Speaker 1>meant a reality that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcended and existed superordinate to</v>

27
00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:30.800
<v Speaker 1>the physical reality of more real </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

28
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.220
<v Speaker 1>That's whatever consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something we understand from a </v>

29
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.551
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all that's been represented in </v>

30
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 1>our mythologies as far back as we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>push them as an independent agent in the</v>

31
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:47.120
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving rise to form.</v>

32
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>That's how we treat each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we recognize ourselves.</v>

33
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.010
<v Speaker 1>That's how we judge each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make your bed and then you lie in it</v>

34
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.710
<v Speaker 1>and everyone knows it and that's not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that you're not subject to random </v>

35
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.430
<v Speaker 1>and chaotic circumstances and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy of life.</v>

36
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Just because you can do some things </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you can do everything,</v>

37
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>but you can do some things and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do them,</v>

38
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.960
<v Speaker 1>then things fall apart and the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with things falling apart is that you </v>

39
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.281
<v Speaker 1>will be happy about it to the degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not trying to repair them </v>

40
00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 1>because to the degree that you do not </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest what's within you,</v>

41
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.440
<v Speaker 1>then your life falls apart around you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything that could make you </v>

42
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.030
<v Speaker 1>bitter multiplies until you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where you want the destruction</v>

43
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:35.180
<v Speaker 1>you want to bring it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not surprising.</v>

44
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.970
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] life can be so terrible that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question of whether or not it should</v>

45
00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:44.971
<v Speaker 1>exist at all can be a real question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the answer to that is his life so </v>

46
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 1>terrible that it shouldn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:53.641
<v Speaker 1>the answer is it depends on how you live</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and if your life is so terrible that </v>

48
00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:59.371
<v Speaker 1>you can't bear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it raises the question of whether </v>

49
00:02:59.371 --> 00:03:02.101
<v Speaker 1>or not you're living at properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not to say that people don't </v>

50
00:03:02.101 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>suffer under burdens that are too great </v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to bear.</v>

51
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:09.871
<v Speaker 1>They certainly do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter because if you let </v>

52
00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:13.921
<v Speaker 1>that embitter you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you let that destroy your allegiance </v>

53
00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:17.611
<v Speaker 1>to the proper path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all it does is make that worse and </v>

54
00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no out.</v>
