1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.490
<v Speaker 1>There's three things that divide women </v>
<v Speaker 1>and men most,</v>

2
00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:04.740
<v Speaker 1>particularly from the psychometric </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>One is that women are more agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>than men,</v>

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>and so that seems to be the primary </v>
<v Speaker 1>maternal dimension as far as I can tell,</v>

5
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 1>it's associated with a desire to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>

6
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's associated with interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 1>closeness,</v>

7
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politeness.</v>

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Women are reliably higher than men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the Scandinavian countries</v>

9
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:27.681
<v Speaker 1>and in the countries where </v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism has progressed the </v>

10
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:27.681
<v Speaker 1>farthest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's where the difference is.</v>

11
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Maximize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things James Demore </v>

12
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.510
<v Speaker 1>pointed out quite correctly in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>infamous google memo.</v>

13
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are higher in negative emotion,</v>

14
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:40.611
<v Speaker 1>so that's anxiety and emotional pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that difference is approximately </v>

15
00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:44.780
<v Speaker 1>the same size and again that maximizes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in egalitarian societies which is </v>

16
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.221
<v Speaker 1>extremely interesting and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest difference is the difference in </v>

17
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:52.821
<v Speaker 1>interest between people and things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so women are more interested in people </v>

18
00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:56.691
<v Speaker 1>and men are more interested in things </v>
<v Speaker 1>which goes along quite nicely with your </v>

19
00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 1>car anecdote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about men interacting with</v>

20
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Matt and again is that it isn't that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they respect each other's viewpoints.</v>

21
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>That's not exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens with a man,</v>

22
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 1>and I know a lot of men that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard as as remarkably tough people for</v>

23
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>one reason or another and everything you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with them is a form of combat.</v>

24
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want your viewpoint taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

25
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.060
<v Speaker 1>often you have to yell them down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're not going to stop talking </v>

26
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 1>unless you start talking over them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:28.611
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like manner automatically </v>

28
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>giving respect to other men because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just doesn't happen.</v>

29
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:33.831
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the combat is there and it's expected </v>

30
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:36.890
<v Speaker 1>and one of the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is part of the reason why I </v>

31
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.570
<v Speaker 1>think men are being taken out of so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>of academia and,</v>

32
00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:43.571
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the academic world in general </v>

33
00:01:43.571 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the world in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that man actually don't have any idea</v>

34
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>how to compete with women.</v>

35
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Because the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you unleash yourself </v>

36
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're an absolute bully.</v>

37
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:57.471
<v Speaker 1>And there's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if men unleashed themselves on </v>

38
00:01:57.471 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>other men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be pretty goddamn brutal.</v>

39
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Especially for the men that are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough and this.</v>

40
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:06.141
<v Speaker 1>So that just doesn't happen with women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so you can unleash yourself </v>

41
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>completely if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a bully,</v>

42
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:10.290
<v Speaker 1>if you lose while you're just bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathetic.</v>

43
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Speaker 1>So how the hell are you supposed to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>a game like that,</v>

44
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.290
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in I've worked with lots of women in </v>

45
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>law firms and in Canada for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and high achieving women,</v>

46
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:21.990
<v Speaker 1>like really remarkable people I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

47
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.410
<v Speaker 1>And they're often nonplussed I would say</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the attitude of the man in the law </v>

48
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.151
<v Speaker 1>firm because they would like to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone pulling together because </v>

49
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:35.391
<v Speaker 1>they're all part of the same team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas the manner like at each other's </v>

50
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:39.261
<v Speaker 1>throats in an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a cooperative way because they want </v>

51
00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:42.771
<v Speaker 1>the law firm to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they want to be the person who's at </v>

52
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>the top of the success hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

53
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:44.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

54
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't jive well with the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive or cooperative ethos.</v>

55
00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:53.910
<v Speaker 1>That's part and parcel of agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't really have any idea how</v>

56
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>to integrate male and female dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right.</v>

57
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>This is why I this show,</v>

58
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.250
<v Speaker 2>real housewives and went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is more sentence scorns and just </v>

59
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.250
<v Speaker 2>say just last night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

60
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 2>I was watching an episode right where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the women were at each other.</v>

61
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At a party and in,</v>

62
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in recounting,</v>

63
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.900
<v Speaker 2>but I said this to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you said this to me and you and the </v>

64
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 2>men got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got together there and said,</v>

65
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:20.911
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the way they communicate with </v>

66
00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:20.911
<v Speaker 2>each other and insight in the men we </v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

67
00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:25.790
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just we'll have a fistfight and wheel </v>

68
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.801
<v Speaker 2>him in 10 minutes later we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a beer at the bar next to each </v>

69
00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:29.880
<v Speaker 2>other and so and I have observed that my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind fire daughter,</v>

70
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.590
<v Speaker 1>my daughter used to be really irritated </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that because she,</v>

71
00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:38.591
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most people was the target of </v>

72
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:42.761
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conspiratorial bullying when she's no </v>

73
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:42.761
<v Speaker 1>pushover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter.</v>

74
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:45.950
<v Speaker 1>So this wasn't like this was a continual</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing or that she didn't know what to do</v>

75
00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:50.951
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she used to observe these girls </v>

76
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:52.730
<v Speaker 1>conspiring against her and then black </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting your name on on facebook,</v>

77
00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:57.731
<v Speaker 1>which is part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part and parcel of the typical female </v>

78
00:03:57.731 --> 00:03:58.970
<v Speaker 1>bullying routine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is often reputation demolition,</v>

79
00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:00.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there's a good literature on that.</v>

80
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>And then she'd watched what would happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>if my brother or my son would have a </v>

81
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.460
<v Speaker 1>dispute with his friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:09.110
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they were drinking and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a dispute,</v>

83
00:04:09.111 --> 00:04:11.250
<v Speaker 1>they'd have a fight and then the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>day they were friends again.</v>

84
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:16.251
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing that's strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that men have a way of bringing a </v>

85
00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:18.410
<v Speaker 1>conflict to a head and resolving it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

86
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.620
<v Speaker 1>And that it isn't the obvious to me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>women have that same.</v>

87
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps you might call it a luxury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the case that men don't </v>

88
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.890
<v Speaker 1>know what to do when they get into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict with a woman.</v>

89
00:04:27.891 --> 00:04:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Because what the hell are you supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do?</v>

90
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly what you're supposed to do is </v>

91
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 1>avoid it.</v>
