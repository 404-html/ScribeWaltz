1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Speaker 1>That his brother and went to feed their </v>
<v Speaker 1>father's flock and check him.</v>

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:05.910
<v Speaker 1>So they took off and Israel said unto </v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph,</v>

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>do you know what my brother and feed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flock and check him calm and I will send</v>

4
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:14.781
<v Speaker 1>thee unto him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said to him and he said to him </v>

5
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:14.781
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here tomorrow.</v>

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>And when they saw him afar off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even before he came near onto them,</v>

7
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.780
<v Speaker 1>they conspired against him to slay him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rough people back then,</v>

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

9
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>this sort of thing is happening quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently.</v>

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>And they said to one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behold the dreamer cometh.</v>

11
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Come now therefore let us slay him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cast him into some pit and we will say </v>

12
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>some evil beast has devoured him and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>shall see what becomes of his dreams.</v>

13
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>So there's an echo of the Cain and Abel </v>
<v Speaker 1>story there.</v>

14
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

15
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite as clear because indicate</v>
<v Speaker 1>enables store able is clearly just doing</v>

16
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here you can't quite get a handle on</v>

17
00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:01.371
<v Speaker 1>Joseph's character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell if he is actually the </v>

18
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>elect or if he's just a spoiled Brat </v>
<v Speaker 1>with delusions of grandeur,</v>

19
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

20
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because his </v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers,</v>

21
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:11.931
<v Speaker 1>they're so irritated at his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he's favored and perhaps </v>

22
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:16.101
<v Speaker 1>even the fact that he might be someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>destined for for something special,</v>

23
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>that they find it perfectly reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>to destroy that and it's so hard.</v>

24
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:28.221
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting how often that motif</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pulling down in ideal manifest itself</v>

25
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>in these old stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.560
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the pattern is established in the </v>

27
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.721
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just repeats and repeats and repeats </v>

28
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:41.481
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's dead true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it just repeats all the time so </v>

29
00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>that people are annoyed about how tragic</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives are.</v>

30
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.680
<v Speaker 1>They're annoyed that they're subject to </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence and they're annoyed that </v>

31
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.130
<v Speaker 1>they're not doing as well as other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are doing and that makes them up,</v>

32
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>puts them exactly into this state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

33
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe with modern people,</v>

34
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to kill someone because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're resentful as a modern person,</v>

35
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't generally slay them and throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>them into a pit.</v>

36
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 1>You know what you do is you just killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>them slowly over a few decades and it </v>

37
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>isn't obvious to me that that's any </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

38
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.900
<v Speaker 1>So I've seen plenty of married couples </v>
<v Speaker 1>who were in that situation.</v>

39
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there is this Mitch Hedberg,</v>

40
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.190
<v Speaker 1>he used to complain about turtleneck </v>
<v Speaker 1>phase.</v>

41
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>It was like being strangled by a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>weak midget and it's probably really </v>

42
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>politically incorrect joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a funny joke.</v>

43
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 1>and then you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see relationships that are like </v>

45
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.001
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like each person has their hands </v>

46
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:46.281
<v Speaker 1>around the neck of the other person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have enough courage to </v>

47
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:48.981
<v Speaker 1>actually to squeeze it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just put enough pressure on to cut the </v>

48
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:53.631
<v Speaker 1>circulation off a tiny bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the person just gets like a die over </v>

49
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>a 30 year period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

50
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.150
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you all laugh because you know,</v>

51
00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:02.150
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's.</v>
