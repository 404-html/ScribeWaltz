1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Consider the overwhelming success as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Patreon account the money raised by </v>

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.501
<v Speaker 1>rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will you be doing with the </v>

3
00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:08.501
<v Speaker 1>contributions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:08.501
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

5
00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:10.130
<v Speaker 1>so I've got a couple of things to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

6
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>So the first one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.810
<v Speaker 1>I would say a number of people have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt and not an overwhelming number,</v>

8
00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:22.811
<v Speaker 1>but a number of people have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to take me to task for the </v>

9
00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>fact that my Patreon support has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it overwhelmingly successful.</v>

10
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.060
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll tell you how I formulate my </v>
<v Speaker 1>response to that.</v>

11
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.700
<v Speaker 1>The first is I'm generating almost all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my content and making it completely </v>

12
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:39.350
<v Speaker 1>publicly accessible so it's free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:42.590
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that way I'm bringing,</v>

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I think awareness of psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues to a very large number of people.</v>

15
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:51.911
<v Speaker 1>And so far at the moment my view count </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube is up to $30 million and I </v>

16
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>did a little bit of calculations last </v>
<v Speaker 1>week to try to figure out what the total</v>

17
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>view count was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the cuts of my lectures that have </v>

19
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>been appearing on Youtube.</v>

20
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.930
<v Speaker 1>And then the political material as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's upward of $50 million </v>

21
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm making psychological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>political content available to $50 </v>

22
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

23
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a reasonable thing to do</v>

24
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who don't agree with what I'm </v>

25
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>saying might differ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that could be separated from</v>

26
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.730
<v Speaker 1>the educational content as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

27
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:26.060
<v Speaker 1>and then with regards to the Patriot on </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers,</v>

28
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.420
<v Speaker 1>every single person who's doing that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it entirely voluntarily.</v>

29
00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:34.421
<v Speaker 1>And I also set up that Patriot on </v>
<v Speaker 1>account long before any of this </v>

30
00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:35.090
<v Speaker 1>political material emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

31
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>And my sense with the patron viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guys can clue me in if I'm wrong</v>

32
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's two things happening.</v>

33
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.840
<v Speaker 1>One is it enables people who are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>very happy about the current political </v>

34
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.971
<v Speaker 1>situation in the west to to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to contribute to something that might be</v>

35
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.740
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree attempting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stem the tide of such things as toxic </v>

36
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.121
<v Speaker 1>political correctness and second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it enables people to support my </v>

37
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:09.551
<v Speaker 1>endeavors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring general education to a wider </v>

38
00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:12.701
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems like a good deal for </v>

39
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:12.701
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

40
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:12.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

41
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a particularly good deal for me and</v>

42
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm certainly not complaining about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening,</v>

43
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:20.981
<v Speaker 1>but I would also point out that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't exactly been a straightforward </v>

44
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.790
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

45
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>so I guess if anyone else wants to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

47
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>they're more than welcome to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now having said that,</v>

48
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also say that the real issue </v>

49
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.361
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is the fact that this </v>

50
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.971
<v Speaker 1>isn't self evident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is also a commentary on the toxicity of </v>

51
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 1>our culture at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it actually isn't the issue.</v>

52
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>The issue isn't really how much money </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

53
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's a resentful and at </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively vicious way of judging </v>

54
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.611
<v Speaker 1>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the issue is what you do with </v>

55
00:02:58.611 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>the money when you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

56
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a particularly hedonistic person</v>

57
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not 25 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm 55 years old and I'm going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfather and a couple of months,</v>

59
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank God for that.</v>

60
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what I want to do with that money is</v>

61
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>to do the best things I can possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of to do with it.</v>

62
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I'm thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

63
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:22.981
<v Speaker 1>I started this biblical series and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that's helped thankful thanks to you </v>

64
00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:26.551
<v Speaker 1>guys on Patrion because that enabled me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to generate the capital that was </v>

65
00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>necessary to rent the theater because </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 12 lectures that was a $60,000</v>

66
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>investment about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

67
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 1>And then another $8,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

68
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.930
<v Speaker 1>for the camera work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that had to be basically dealt with </v>

69
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>upfront.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a reasonable financial risks.</v>

70
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:46.141
<v Speaker 1>Now I've been crazily fortunate in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater tickets have also sold out,</v>

71
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:52.261
<v Speaker 1>so it looks like the biblical series </v>
<v Speaker 1>will pay for itself with some extra </v>

72
00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:52.261
<v Speaker 1>leftover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

73
00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty happy about that because that</v>

74
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>gives me some more working capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

75
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 1>well what am I going to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital?</v>

76
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to continue doing the sorts of</v>

77
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:06.751
<v Speaker 1>things that I'm already doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do a series on the hundred </v>

78
00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>greatest books of the western Canon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>

79
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to move genuine humanities </v>
<v Speaker 1>education out of the universities where </v>

80
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.081
<v Speaker 1>it isn't being taught anyways as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell online where people can </v>

81
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:20.941
<v Speaker 1>access it freely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to a wide variety of people </v>

82
00:04:20.941 --> 00:04:24.571
<v Speaker 1>right now about trying to do that in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more formal sense so that the </v>

83
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:28.381
<v Speaker 1>possibility for widespread university </v>
<v Speaker 1>education can be universally accessible </v>

84
00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:33.271
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>crack is the problem of how to teach </v>

85
00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:33.271
<v Speaker 1>people to write.</v>

86
00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a real troublesome thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

87
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 1>you know you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go onto my website,</v>

88
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:43.681
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go into courses and you go into </v>

89
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>psychology for 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look carefully there,</v>

90
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:52.981
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that there's an essay rubric </v>
<v Speaker 1>that tells people how to write and </v>

91
00:04:52.981 --> 00:04:56.880
<v Speaker 1>actually that's become quite popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're interested in how to </v>

92
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.481
<v Speaker 1>learn to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written something about that </v>

93
00:05:00.481 --> 00:05:02.431
<v Speaker 1>already and we're going to make a piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of software that's going to help people </v>

94
00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:05.071
<v Speaker 1>learn to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I've got plans for how to make </v>

95
00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>writing education broadly accessible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

96
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:12.091
<v Speaker 1>so I would like to make humanities </v>
<v Speaker 1>education of the highest order broadly </v>

97
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 1>accessible to people and I also want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>teach them how to write and I'm going to</v>

98
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 1>try to crack the online university </v>
<v Speaker 1>accreditation problem.</v>

99
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.610
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the money that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a substantial proportion of the money</v>

100
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>that is being donated to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

101
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:28.180
<v Speaker 1>or is being offered to me by my monthly </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters.</v>

102
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>So that's all of you people is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be going to projects exactly like that.</v>

103
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.500
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell else would I do with the </v>

104
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.500
<v Speaker 1>money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

105
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me money is a tool.</v>

106
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the means whereby you develop a</v>

107
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:48.271
<v Speaker 1>luxurious lifestyle and spend your time </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning yourself half to death in the </v>

108
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>sun and the Caribbean snorting cocaine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and chasing hookers,</v>

109
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

110
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.580
<v Speaker 1>that's just not in the cards for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

111
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.910
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I want to devote it towards the </v>

112
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things that I've already been </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing except on a broader scale.</v>

113
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.320
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:08.321
<v Speaker 1>and I think people like Elan Musk to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that I'm comparing myself to Elon </v>

115
00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Musk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean he has plenty of money and I </v>

116
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.550
<v Speaker 1>mean you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's got to have the damn money.</v>

117
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.530
<v Speaker 1>It might as well be people who have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of vision that people like he does </v>

118
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>have because maybe they'll do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for the world.</v>

119
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean I hope his gigafactories produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries like mad so that we can start </v>

120
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 1>to make alternative energy sources </v>
<v Speaker 1>economically viable and maybe reduce our</v>

121
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:34.871
<v Speaker 1>dependence on oil and maybe get </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves out from underneath the thumb </v>

122
00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>of the Saudi Arab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be a good thing.</v>

123
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.080
<v Speaker 1>So the monetary issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

124
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:43.140
<v Speaker 1>it's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it is not that you have the </v>

125
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.140
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what you do with it.</v>

126
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.310
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>

127
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:46.820
<v Speaker 1>some of them might plants and that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them because I'm going to come up</v>

128
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:51.821
<v Speaker 1>with a bunch more plans and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to implement them as rapidly as I </v>

129
00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:54.911
<v Speaker 1>possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've put my clinical practice on hiatus </v>

130
00:06:54.911 --> 00:06:59.381
<v Speaker 1>for the next three months so that I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chance to think and I've requested </v>

131
00:06:59.381 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>that the university advanced my </v>
<v Speaker 1>sabbatical by one year,</v>

132
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:05.831
<v Speaker 1>so I should have about a year to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what I should be doing with </v>

133
00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:09.581
<v Speaker 1>youtube and how I can be promoting broad</v>
<v Speaker 1>public education of the highest quality </v>

134
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>and that's a really fun problem to solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that I'm being supported by</v>

135
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 1>all of you people on Patrion makes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that avail to all be able to</v>

136
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:22.220
<v Speaker 1>devote my time to that much higher.</v>

137
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what I'm going to do with it.</v>

138
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do the best things I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly think of to do with it.</v>

139
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.680
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully that'll work.</v>

140
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.350
<v Speaker 1>And so far it seems to be going well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

141
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

142
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've been taking them back quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit by the.</v>

143
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not surprising that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who've been trying to take me </v>

144
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.231
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say are squawking and bitching </v>

145
00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 1>because I happened to be a generating a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly reasonable income from this.</v>

146
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Although I don't think about it as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>income,</v>

147
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:52.640
<v Speaker 1>as I already said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about it as a,</v>

148
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>as a toolkit for pursuing more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting things.</v>

149
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like if that's the best they can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to continuing to tarnish my</v>

150
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then let them,</v>

151
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.180
<v Speaker 1>let them go right ahead about that and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think the proof is in the outcome and </v>

152
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:13.120
<v Speaker 1>the biblical series and that's a direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the Patriot and support </v>

153
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.170
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be going like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>

154
00:08:14.171 --> 00:08:19.171
<v Speaker 1>about 500,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have watched the videos so far </v>

155
00:08:19.171 --> 00:08:20.540
<v Speaker 1>with another who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of people listening to</v>

156
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:23.210
<v Speaker 1>the podcasts and that's just a bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>miracle that,</v>

157
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:28.211
<v Speaker 1>that many people would be interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I consider the fundamental </v>

158
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:30.770
<v Speaker 1>foundation for any true humanities </v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

159
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 1>So great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll build from there.</v>

160
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:35.270
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm gonna do with the money.</v>

161
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if people don't like that,</v>

162
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:41.240
<v Speaker 1>then they don't have to donate or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to subscribe.</v>

163
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>It's hardly like it's mandatory.</v>
