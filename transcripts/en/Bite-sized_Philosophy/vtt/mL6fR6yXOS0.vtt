00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.720
<v Speaker 1>At the end of 1929,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kremlin decreed that millions of </v>

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.901
<v Speaker 1>peasants from individually owned farms </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be forced into agricultural </v>

3
00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:12.410
<v Speaker 1>collectives or cold causes seen in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes of the bureau as pliant providers </v>

4
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>of Soviet agricultural needs in defiance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the facts,</v>

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.590
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the ologists hammered out </v>

6
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.361
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate Marxist terminology to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain what was going on throughout </v>

7
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>grain producing areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was said resistance to this </v>

8
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:32.001
<v Speaker 1>scientific scheme was being organized by</v>
<v Speaker 1>so called rich peasants are kulaks with </v>

9
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:37.221
<v Speaker 1>his customer brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore stellan decreed the </v>

10
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:40.071
<v Speaker 1>liquidation of the cool acts as a class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll stand in like this idea of like </v>

11
00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:44.031
<v Speaker 1>group guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a major theme for Stella and </v>

12
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>that meant I really didn't have to ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to you as an individual.</v>

13
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I could just decide if you were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor,</v>

14
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>engineer or a Kulak or a German or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

15
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:56.271
<v Speaker 1>Ethnic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racial or educational division happened </v>

16
00:00:56.271 --> 00:00:56.330
<v Speaker 1>to characterize my particular target at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

17
00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:59.460
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't matter if you were guilty </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an individual.</v>

18
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>That whole notion never even obtained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was class guilted mattered and if you</v>

19
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>were in one of those classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we're better without you.</v>

20
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>And of course the nature of the class </v>
<v Speaker 1>just changed constantly.</v>

21
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>But it was perfectly logical thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think if you believed in like historical</v>

22
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your parents were rich birch wha,</v>

23
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:20.121
<v Speaker 1>what was the probability that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a useful part of the </v>

24
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:23.541
<v Speaker 1>workers' collective bs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just to get rid of you ahead of </v>

25
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:23.541
<v Speaker 1>time so you didn't cause too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

26
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>So then you think about these cool acts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich peasants,</v>

27
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>who are these people like when we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the individual level,</v>

28
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.680
<v Speaker 1>so you go on a village village was full </v>
<v Speaker 1>of surfs like not 40 years before.</v>

29
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>So these are people just struggling out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the feudal society.</v>

30
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:43.851
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've got some people in there </v>

31
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:43.851
<v Speaker 1>who've managed to be successful enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>as farmers,</v>

32
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:48.321
<v Speaker 1>which is no easy thing to like have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>house and maybe hire one person and you </v>

33
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:52.551
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe have a little extra food in the </v>

34
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:53.290
<v Speaker 1>larger and a few kind of material </v>
<v Speaker 1>possession.</v>

35
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>So these are successful people and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

36
00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>well they're the ones that actually knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to farm to one theory or you can say</v>

37
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:04.521
<v Speaker 1>the reason they had all this stuff was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they stoled it from all the </v>

38
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:04.521
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

39
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:04.521
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

40
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>so I marched into town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Soviet revolutionary,</v>

41
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

42
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>you know those rich people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stole everything they have from you</v>

43
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

44
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>which are you guys is going to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

45
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be the sort of </v>

46
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 1>struggling people just underneath them </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are really trying to get ahead,</v>

47
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's where they're hoping to </v>

48
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:26.091
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be.</v>

49
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>They're resentful and revengeful few who</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

50
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is fundamentally unfair and </v>

51
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.861
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious that those sons of bitches </v>
<v Speaker 1>got what they want by stealing it from </v>

52
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:33.861
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

53
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>And here it turns out that if I just go </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the street and steal it back,</v>

54
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>well not only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only am I allowed to do that,</v>

55
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>but according to this new and emergent </v>
<v Speaker 1>etiology,</v>

56
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the best thing I could possibly </v>

57
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.151
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then multiply that story by several </v>

58
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:53.420
<v Speaker 1>million participants and you have like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first five years of the Soviet </v>

59
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what do we have there?</v>

60
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.480
<v Speaker 1>The result was a catastrophic onslaught </v>
<v Speaker 1>on millions of peasant households at </v>

61
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.711
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>activists and local officials read </v>

62
00:03:03.711 --> 00:03:03.711
<v Speaker 1>bullies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

63
00:03:03.711 --> 00:03:08.640
<v Speaker 1>brutalized peasants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing them to surrender their </v>

64
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.640
<v Speaker 1>homesteads and their possessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deportations,</v>

65
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>arrests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and killing soon followed as terror.</v>

66
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:15.691
<v Speaker 1>Generalized the violence mounted to full</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale rebellion in various places with </v>

67
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>regular troops engaged for months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

68
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>suppressing peasant uprisings resistance</v>
<v Speaker 1>took various forms,</v>

69
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>usually reflecting the hopeless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperate anguish of a doomed population</v>

70
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>in the Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were even women's rebellions,</v>

71
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.190
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous uprisings of peasant women </v>
<v Speaker 1>who attacked the local Coco's is to </v>

72
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.630
<v Speaker 1>demand a return of confiscated foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>products with a colossal impact on the </v>

73
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Soviet economy.</v>

74
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Peasants slaughtered their animals by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the millions rather than see them seized</v>

75
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.840
<v Speaker 1>for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fighting raged as the dreadful </v>

76
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>process of deep Kula Ization continued </v>
<v Speaker 1>style in order to further assault on the</v>

77
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:59.611
<v Speaker 1>recalcitrant peasantry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What conquest caused the terror famine </v>

78
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:03.241
<v Speaker 1>of 1932 Moscow rights conquest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's from a book called the harvest of </v>

79
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:09.421
<v Speaker 1>sorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowingly decreed green procurement </v>

80
00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:13.070
<v Speaker 1>procurement's from the Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Analysis were exceeding by far with the </v>

81
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.201
<v Speaker 1>local population could produce right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant that everyone who lived </v>

82
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 1>there was forest in order to deliver </v>
<v Speaker 1>more grain than they had ever grown.</v>

83
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Communist brigades roam the countryside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing agriculturalists to disgorge the</v>

84
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 1>little they had been able to produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>under conditions of severe dislocation.</v>

85
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Grain sat unused in state reserves while</v>
<v Speaker 1>the local population starved.</v>
