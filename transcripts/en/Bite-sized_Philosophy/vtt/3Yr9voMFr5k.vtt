1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.240
<v Speaker 1>I love my child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my mother so much that I couldn't</v>

2
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>survive if anything happened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have some serious thinking</v>

3
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:15.531
<v Speaker 1>to do about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you really want to curse </v>

4
00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:15.531
<v Speaker 1>someone with that kind of love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

5
00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:17.110
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't live without you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

6
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away from me.</v>

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

8
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:24.650
<v Speaker 1>That's the oedipal mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll forgive you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you do.</v>

10
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

11
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.800
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what I do a.</v>

12
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>You are not my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

13
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible thing to do to someone </v>

14
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.050
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the witch in the Hansel and </v>

15
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.561
<v Speaker 1>Gretel story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all gingerbread and outside to the last </v>

16
00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:49.221
<v Speaker 1>kid inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feed them candy and make them fat </v>

17
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>and eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

18
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>That's Hansel and Gretel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the oedipal mother.</v>

19
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>That's one of Freud's major discoveries </v>
<v Speaker 1>if gets a major discovery.</v>

20
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like the devouring force of love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want the person to be able to stand </v>

21
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.380
<v Speaker 1>on their own and the price you pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is that you stand on your own.</v>

22
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like good to have you around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glad you're here,</v>

23
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

24
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>if tragedies when and if and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy strikes either of us,</v>

25
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:17.571
<v Speaker 1>I hope that one of us is standing when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it blows past and that there's a </v>

26
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:22.491
<v Speaker 1>harshness about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's unbelievably cruel because you </v>

27
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:22.491
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

28
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:22.491
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if my mother died,</v>

29
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I could live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

30
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:28.731
<v Speaker 1>what kind of monster are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly you the death of your mother </v>

31
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:28.731
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do you in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that being a monster is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right thing.</v>

33
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a rough thing to learn,</v>

34
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's necessary necessarily learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>because it also makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

37
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>as you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time you're in your mid twenties,</v>

38
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:49.191
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should start having a relationship </v>

39
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:49.191
<v Speaker 1>with your parents.</v>

40
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:53.600
<v Speaker 1>That's approximately one of peers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell if you have that.</v>

41
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>So here's a little trick you can use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have parents,</v>

42
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>obviously they have friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably care what your parents </v>

43
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

44
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you care what their friends think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

45
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

46
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>not nearly as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I would say,</v>

47
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:11.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you care what your parents think </v>

48
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:11.541
<v Speaker 1>of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they're the same people.</v>

49
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:15.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just luck of the draw that your </v>

50
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.980
<v Speaker 1>parents or someone else's kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

51
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 1>they don't think the same way about them</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do.</v>

52
00:02:18.731 --> 00:02:23.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you see that you have a </v>

53
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:23.731
<v Speaker 1>projection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

54
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:26.721
<v Speaker 1>If by the time you're 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if what your parents think of you </v>

55
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>matters more than what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a random set of their friends.</v>

56
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:32.211
<v Speaker 1>Think of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've still got your parents </v>

57
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:32.211
<v Speaker 1>confused with with God.</v>

58
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:36.200
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've still got them confused with an </v>

59
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>archetype and you're still a child and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

60
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty damn rude not to think about</v>

61
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>what your parents think of you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to care.</v>

62
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

63
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of rude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you'll be useful for them when</v>

64
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>they get old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a much better form of caring.</v>

65
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're going to be independent</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and strong enough and and </v>

66
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>detached enough so that when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>

67
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>when the power dynamic shifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it will,</v>

68
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.170
<v Speaker 1>that you'll be the person that can carry</v>
<v Speaker 1>things forward.</v>

69
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do a better thing for them </v>

70
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.500
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

71
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the best of all possible outcomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your parents.</v>
