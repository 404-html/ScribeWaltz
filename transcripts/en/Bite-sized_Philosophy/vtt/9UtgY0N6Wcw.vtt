1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.840
<v Speaker 1>The Soviets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given their idea of class guilt,</v>

2
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:08.340
<v Speaker 1>which sounds a lot like white privilege </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me or any other form of racism,</v>

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.370
<v Speaker 1>they use that doctrine to just round up </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the kulaks they were the productive </v>

4
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.181
<v Speaker 1>farmers and ship them off to Siberia and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then 6 million Ukrainian starved to </v>

5
00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:20.181
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>they had too many Ukrainians anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it didn't really matter.</v>

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the postmodern types.</v>

8
00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 1>this all came was revealed in such </v>
<v Speaker 1>painful detail that even the kind of </v>

10
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>closed minded idealogue that Norman </v>
<v Speaker 1>referred to just quite,</v>

11
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:42.201
<v Speaker 1>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't quite muster up the moral </v>

12
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>courage to keep beating the same damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>drum.</v>

13
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>So what they did instead being highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent individuals,</v>

14
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:51.921
<v Speaker 1>was play a game of sleight of hand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed these Marxist </v>

15
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions into postmodernism in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 seventies.</v>

16
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>And the idea basically was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

17
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 1>the working class isn't going to rise up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and crushed the bourgeoisie because </v>

18
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.420
<v Speaker 1>first of all they're getting rich and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't supposed to happen.</v>

19
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:07.421
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it sort of seemed to be a </v>

20
00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:07.421
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe when that occurred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say in Russia.</v>

21
00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe we won't do that anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the working class actually isn't</v>

22
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>buying into this either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also a problem,</v>

23
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having internalized their own </v>

24
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't buy into this,</v>

25
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.100
<v Speaker 1>to the global myth of Utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's because they've had some </v>

26
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly possible.</v>

27
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the slight of hand was,</v>

28
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fine,</v>

29
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:31.251
<v Speaker 1>we'll just play a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oppressor versus oppressed game and </v>

30
00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:31.680
<v Speaker 1>we'll introduce identity politics.</v>

31
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

32
00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:39.301
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not being oppressed because of </v>

33
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:40.831
<v Speaker 1>you're a member of the working class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're being oppressed because you're a </v>

34
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:43.441
<v Speaker 1>woman or you're being oppressed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an ethnicity that's outside the</v>

35
00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:45.730
<v Speaker 1>main paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that might be.</v>

36
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's because of your,</v>

37
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

38
00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:52.570
<v Speaker 1>your sexual preference or your sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity or whatever.</v>

39
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Whatever places you in some manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the normative culture.</v>

40
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is the postmodernist,</v>

41
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

42
00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:01.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your culture is good for something.</v>

43
00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>It gives you a hierarchy of value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It rewards competent people,</v>

44
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 1>it gives you a direction so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>climb up,</v>

45
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:12.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise everything's leveled </v>

46
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:12.211
<v Speaker 1>to nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then why do anything?</v>

47
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:13.300
<v Speaker 1>They don't care about any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe that there's any such</v>

48
00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:15.520
<v Speaker 1>thing as competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe that there's any such</v>

49
00:02:15.521 --> 00:02:18.820
<v Speaker 1>thing as up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all postmodernism wipes,</v>

50
00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 1>all of that out.</v>

51
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 1>And so when the postmodernists analyze </v>
<v Speaker 1>the text,</v>

52
00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:27.811
<v Speaker 1>all they care about is how it privileges</v>
<v Speaker 1>the position of the author and who had </v>

53
00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:29.230
<v Speaker 1>impresses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only thing they regard as</v>

54
00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:31.960
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they don't believe in grand unifying</v>

55
00:02:31.961 --> 00:02:36.961
<v Speaker 1>narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe that there's a </v>

56
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.461
<v Speaker 1>Canadian identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe that there's an </v>

57
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:40.291
<v Speaker 1>American identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe that there is a </v>

58
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:40.291
<v Speaker 1>western identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe that value structures</v>

59
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:41.770
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if they are,</v>

60
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.440
<v Speaker 1>they're replaceable with some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>value structure.</v>

61
00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:48.220
<v Speaker 1>They certainly don't believe that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any biological grounding.</v>

62
00:02:48.221 --> 00:02:50.530
<v Speaker 1>That there's any such thing as a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

63
00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:53.560
<v Speaker 1>It's all socially constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really convenient.</v>

64
00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:58.561
<v Speaker 1>If what you want to do is be the author </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an entirely social constructed you </v>

65
00:02:58.561 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 1>utopia that you can run.</v>
