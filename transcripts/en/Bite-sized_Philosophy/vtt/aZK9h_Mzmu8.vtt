1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea of white privilege is </v>

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.890
<v Speaker 1>absolutely reprehensible and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>because white people aren't,</v>

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have all sorts of privileges and most</v>

4
00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:15.751
<v Speaker 1>people have privileges of all sorts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be grateful for your </v>

5
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:15.970
<v Speaker 1>privileges and work to deserve them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

6
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that you can target an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic group with a collective crime </v>

7
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>regardless of the specific innocence or </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilt of the constituent elements of </v>

8
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.931
<v Speaker 1>that group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is absolutely nothing that's more </v>

9
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:31.360
<v Speaker 1>racist than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely a boring.</v>

10
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't</v>

11
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.660
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

12
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to know more about </v>

13
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.051
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should read about the Kulaks in the </v>

14
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:46.051
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union in the 19 twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k,</v>

15
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:48.250
<v Speaker 1>u l a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k s because they were.</v>

16
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.830
<v Speaker 1>They were farmers who were very </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>

17
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.000
<v Speaker 1>They were the most productive element of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the agricultural strata in,</v>

18
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.050
<v Speaker 1>in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were virtually all killed or </v>

19
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.230
<v Speaker 1>raped and robbed by the collectivists </v>
<v Speaker 1>who insisted that because they showed </v>

20
00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:06.370
<v Speaker 1>signs of wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were criminals.</v>

21
00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

22
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

23
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Roberts.</v>

24
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the one of the consequences of the </v>

25
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 1>prosecution of the Kulaks was the death </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 6 million Ukrainians from a famine in</v>

26
00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:22.291
<v Speaker 1>the 19 thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of collectively held guilt at </v>

27
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:26.281
<v Speaker 1>the level of the individual as a legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>or philosophical principle is dangerous.</v>

28
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>It's precisely this sort of danger that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are really looking for </v>

29
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 1>trouble would push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and,</v>

30
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.270
<v Speaker 1>and just a cursory glance at 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century history should teach anyone who </v>

31
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.010
<v Speaker 1>wants to know exactly how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how unacceptable that is.</v>
