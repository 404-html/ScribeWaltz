1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.260
<v Speaker 2>that's Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the story of Martin,</v>

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll just give it to you very briefly.</v>

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Timeout and aps who are locked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>embrace it at the beginning of time.</v>

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.610
<v Speaker 2>God is of salt water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>garden,</v>

6
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.690
<v Speaker 2>fresh water together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos in order,</v>

7
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give rise,</v>

8
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.870
<v Speaker 2>masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminine.</v>

9
00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:22.750
<v Speaker 2>They give rise to the world of the elder</v>
<v Speaker 2>gods and those are to me,</v>

10
00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:27.751
<v Speaker 2>they're primordial motivational forces </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that and their rage </v>

11
00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:32.851
<v Speaker 2>and their lost and their love and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things that possess us that are </v>

12
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:35.881
<v Speaker 2>there forever and they're out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world acting and they carelessly slay </v>

13
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:40.850
<v Speaker 2>appsu their father and their making a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rocket and then they collapsed and then </v>

14
00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:46.441
<v Speaker 2>tie them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets wind of that and that's time out </v>

15
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:46.441
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

16
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 2>she's kind of a rough looking creature </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's the mother of all things and </v>

17
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.231
<v Speaker 2>so she's not very happy about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are her children have destroyed </v>

18
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:59.910
<v Speaker 2>structure itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus they're noisy and careless and so </v>

19
00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.910
<v Speaker 2>she thinks all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

20
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.190
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

21
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like the God that brings the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flood to know what exactly the same idea</v>

22
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.430
<v Speaker 2>time matt comes back and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

23
00:01:06.431 --> 00:01:07.990
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough is enough.</v>

24
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she makes this battalion of monsters</v>

25
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 2>and puts the worst monster there is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head of the battalion,</v>

26
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 2>his name is king who he's like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>precursor to the idea of Satan and she </v>

27
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.450
<v Speaker 2>lets the gods know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

28
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they're not very happy about this</v>

29
00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:26.890
<v Speaker 2>because their gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

30
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's chaos itself,</v>

31
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She gave birth to everything.</v>

32
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 2>This is no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they send one got out after </v>

33
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.270
<v Speaker 2>another to confront her and they all </v>
<v Speaker 2>come back with their tails between their</v>

34
00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:42.271
<v Speaker 2>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no hope and then one day </v>

35
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:42.271
<v Speaker 2>there's a new guard that emerges and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

36
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:44.230
<v Speaker 2>And the guards know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as he pops up,</v>

37
00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:45.460
<v Speaker 2>they know he's something new.</v>

38
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is happening while the </v>

39
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.231
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamians are assembling themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>into one of the world's first great </v>

40
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:56.431
<v Speaker 2>civilizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all the gods of all those tribes are </v>

41
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:59.701
<v Speaker 2>coming together to organize themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a hierarchy to figure out what </v>

42
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:03.601
<v Speaker 2>proposition rules everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Marta is elected by all the gods </v>

43
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:04.450
<v Speaker 2>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

44
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:06.580
<v Speaker 2>I'll go out there and I'll take on time </v>
<v Speaker 2>map,</v>

45
00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:09.520
<v Speaker 2>but here's the rule from on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you follow me.</v>

46
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I determine destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the top God.</v>

47
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:14.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm the thing at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy.</v>

48
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.910
<v Speaker 2>And all the other gods say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>

49
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.430
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get rid of chaos.</v>

50
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.530
<v Speaker 2>We do exactly what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Marta,</v>

51
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 2>his eyes all the way around his head and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he speaks magic words.</v>

52
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Those are his primary attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he takes a net and he goes out to</v>

53
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.850
<v Speaker 2>confront timeout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

54
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

55
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.060
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he encloses her in the net,</v>

56
00:02:34.061 --> 00:02:36.580
<v Speaker 2>which I think is so cool because it's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>encapsulation,</v>

57
00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:38.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a conceptual encapsulation.</v>

58
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.830
<v Speaker 2>He encloses chaos itself in a conceptual</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

59
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.060
<v Speaker 2>He puts it in the net and then he cuts </v>
<v Speaker 2>her into pieces and he makes the world.</v>

60
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 2>And then that he creates human beings to</v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabit that world and to serve the </v>

61
00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:59.791
<v Speaker 2>gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he creates human beings out of the </v>

62
00:02:59.791 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 2>blood of King of the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the demons.</v>

63
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 2>And that took me to call Andy Young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a student of mine,</v>

64
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:08.011
<v Speaker 2>helped me figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that's pretty damn </v>

65
00:03:08.011 --> 00:03:08.011
<v Speaker 2>pessimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

66
00:03:08.011 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 2>you know what exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a full metaphor.</v>

67
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:11.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like the idea of original sin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

68
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 2>but our joint conclusion</v>

69
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 2>with regards to that was that human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings are the only creatures in </v>

70
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.900
<v Speaker 2>creation that can truly deceive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

71
00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:28.901
<v Speaker 2>We have the capacity for evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like it says in the Adam and Eve </v>

72
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:28.901
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can actually do that.</v>

73
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we're made out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood of King,</v>

74
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:34.070
<v Speaker 2>knew the king of the demons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The we are the thing that can deceive,</v>

75
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.740
<v Speaker 2>that can twist the structure of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

76
00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:41.741
<v Speaker 2>So Marduk now the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the team has had an emperor and the </v>

77
00:03:41.751 --> 00:03:42.860
<v Speaker 2>emperor was the</v>

78
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Avatar of Marta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what made them emperor.</v>

79
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 2>He was only at Emperor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he was going to be Murdoch,</v>

80
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:50.450
<v Speaker 2>he had to be a good Marduk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which man he,</v>

81
00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:55.451
<v Speaker 2>I do confront time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and cut her up and make order out </v>

82
00:03:55.451 --> 00:04:00.081
<v Speaker 2>of her pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what the Mesopotamians used to do </v>

83
00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:02.451
<v Speaker 2>after New Year's celebration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd go outside their walled city and </v>

84
00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:03.780
<v Speaker 2>that's explored territory versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory.</v>

85
00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:06.000
<v Speaker 2>They go outside their world's city into </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos,</v>

86
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.540
<v Speaker 2>and they bring all the statutes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented the gods and they'd act this</v>

87
00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:11.550
<v Speaker 2>out because they were trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>something out,</v>

88
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to figure out what this </v>

89
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.580
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're acting it out,</v>

90
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.790
<v Speaker 2>and then they'd take their emperor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the priest would make them kneel and </v>

91
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.270
<v Speaker 2>they take all his king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is king.</v>

92
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:26.271
<v Speaker 2>Uniform off is emperor uniform off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make them Neil and humiliate them and </v>

93
00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:27.750
<v Speaker 2>nail them with a glove and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

94
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.240
<v Speaker 2>how were you not a good Martech this </v>
<v Speaker 2>year?</v>

95
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he'd recount all the ways that </v>

96
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.151
<v Speaker 2>he was inadequate in confronting chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they'd do the celebration and </v>

97
00:04:38.151 --> 00:04:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Martech would win and the king would go </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep with a royal prostitute.</v>

98
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.260
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that was it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same idea as St George pulling the </v>

99
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.541
<v Speaker 2>Virgin from the Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same idea that if you </v>

100
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:51.450
<v Speaker 2>call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you encounter the reptilian chaos,</v>

101
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:55.410
<v Speaker 2>you can extract something out of it with</v>
<v Speaker 2>which if you unite,</v>

102
00:04:55.411 --> 00:05:00.411
<v Speaker 2>you produce creative order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they were acting out and </v>

103
00:05:00.411 --> 00:05:02.190
<v Speaker 2>that was the basis for the Mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of sovereignty.</v>

104
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.430
<v Speaker 2>It's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so unbelievably smart and know the </v>

105
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.241
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamians had a massive influence on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the civilizations that then had a </v>

106
00:05:11.241 --> 00:05:14.721
<v Speaker 2>massive influence on us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the stories of how the </v>

107
00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:17.580
<v Speaker 2>notion of sovereignty itself came to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the evolution of the idea of God.</v>

108
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.980
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even more importantly,</v>

109
00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:24.390
<v Speaker 2>it's the evolution of the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>redemptive human being.</v>

110
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's taken to.</v>

111
00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:28.650
<v Speaker 2>It's one of its conclusions while in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story of Buddha,</v>

112
00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:33.651
<v Speaker 2>but also in the story of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the perfect individual and </v>

113
00:05:33.651 --> 00:05:33.651
<v Speaker 2>the notion is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

114
00:05:33.651 --> 00:05:38.061
<v Speaker 2>that's the word that speaks truth into </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos at the beginning of time to </v>

115
00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:39.450
<v Speaker 2>generate habitable order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is good.</v>

116
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the story,</v>
