1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Iliads idea was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that things fall apart of their own </v>

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.571
<v Speaker 1>accord merely because they age that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the first motif in the flood </v>

3
00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:09.730
<v Speaker 1>story and that's only to say that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>build something,</v>

4
00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>it indicates if you build something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just leave it the hell alone,</v>

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>it will soon not work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:20.451
<v Speaker 1>And that's entropy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the reasons that the flood </v>

7
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 1>always threatens is merely because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>entropy.</v>

8
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:26.091
<v Speaker 1>And you see that reflected in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian story because one of the </v>

9
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:26.091
<v Speaker 1>reasons that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

10
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>cyrus falls prey to seth is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>these old,</v>

11
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a great hero when he was young </v>

12
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>and created the Egyptian state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the men of renown.</v>

13
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>But now he's old and it's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's willfully blind,</v>

14
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.840
<v Speaker 1>but that's the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that he's old is just to </v>

15
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>start things fall apart of their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>accord.</v>

16
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.570
<v Speaker 1>So once something is given to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to maintain it just to ensure </v>

17
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>its continued existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you actually,</v>

18
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>you actually have a contract with most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things that you own.</v>

19
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a moral contract.</v>

20
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you have a car or you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided that you're going to sacrifice </v>

21
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>to have the car and so you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've performed an ethical calculation,</v>

22
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.890
<v Speaker 1>but the car was only worth the sacrifice</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as it functions as a car and so </v>

23
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that to justify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice you've made,</v>

24
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.140
<v Speaker 1>to have the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to maintain the car because </v>

25
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.081
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you're acting out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition that the thing you </v>

26
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed for actually didn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>value and so your obliterating that as a</v>

27
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:30.981
<v Speaker 1>useful contract and you run into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where the car will just </v>

28
00:01:30.981 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>deteriorate of its own accord and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't have a car at all.</v>

29
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say,</v>

30
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>how do you speed the process by which </v>
<v Speaker 1>your car deteriorates?</v>

31
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's easy.</v>

32
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>You're driving it along the road and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to make a ticking noise.</v>

33
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Tick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>

34
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>

35
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:49.941
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think I should go have that </v>

36
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:49.941
<v Speaker 1>ticking noise checked because you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard it and then you think,</v>

37
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it won't matter.</v>

38
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

39
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>probably it will matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is matter mean well matter his </v>

40
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos to you no matter.</v>

41
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.970
<v Speaker 1>But what it means is that that little </v>
<v Speaker 1>ticking noise is the birthplace of tire </v>

42
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.081
<v Speaker 1>matt in your car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it </v>

43
00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>is that it's your first indication that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon of chaos is going to manifest</v>

44
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>itself in your car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens when you.</v>

45
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I've got a funny story about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a friend in graduate school,</v>

46
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:22.671
<v Speaker 1>someone I really liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't call her mcelliott </v>

47
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>mechanically inclined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>

48
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>And she had an old Honda and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things were notorious for rusting out.</v>

49
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>This is 30 years ago when they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>first produced.</v>

50
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:34.371
<v Speaker 1>They weren't adapted well to Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>winters and we used to go into her car </v>

51
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:38.421
<v Speaker 1>and her Honda and it got a little on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary side because it was so rusty </v>

52
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:40.190
<v Speaker 1>underneath that you can actually see </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the floorboards.</v>

53
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.290
<v Speaker 1>And that actually made me nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you can see through the </v>

54
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.220
<v Speaker 1>floorboards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that they're not really </v>

55
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 1>floorboards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they are is like rust.</v>

56
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.600
<v Speaker 1>And so I mentioned the fact that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a problem to her a couple of </v>

57
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.251
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was sort of blind about it and </v>

58
00:02:58.251 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>one day she was driving down St Lawrence</v>
<v Speaker 1>Street in Montreal,</v>

59
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 1>which is the main running roughly north </v>
<v Speaker 1>and south and her hood popped up it band</v>

60
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:08.131
<v Speaker 1>and popped up spontaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she was really curious about </v>

61
00:03:08.131 --> 00:03:08.131
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

62
00:03:08.131 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>And so she was with this friend of hers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and was just as clueless mechanically as</v>

63
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:16.621
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really quite remarkably </v>

64
00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:18.871
<v Speaker 1>clueless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they pulled off into a service </v>

65
00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>station and had the guy come out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>

66
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:19.940
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

67
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.230
<v Speaker 1>he opened the hood obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what had happened was the body had </v>

68
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>fallen off the frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

69
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.500
<v Speaker 1>And what had happened was the shock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is supposed to be attached to the </v>

70
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had pushed up through the,</v>

71
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hood.</v>

72
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>So literally the car body had fallen </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto the ground and.</v>

73
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.600
<v Speaker 1>But she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she managed to drive the cart.</v>

74
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

75
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.760
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't exactly call that willful </v>

76
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 1>blindness because perhaps there is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of willful blindness.</v>

77
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 1>She didn't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanics,</v>

78
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 1>but you get the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

79
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:56.611
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say she would been in a fatal </v>

80
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:56.611
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

81
00:03:56.611 --> 00:04:00.931
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can shake your fist at God for </v>

82
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:00.931
<v Speaker 1>producing the circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know the fact that you could see</v>

83
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:04.110
<v Speaker 1>through the floorboards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably something that you might</v>

84
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 1>have paid attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's always.</v>

85
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>The question is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if things fall apart around you,</v>

86
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.400
<v Speaker 1>to what degree is it the mere tendency </v>
<v Speaker 1>of things to degenerate entropically </v>

87
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.870
<v Speaker 1>because they do that of their own accord</v>
<v Speaker 1>or have you sped the probability of </v>

88
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:23.911
<v Speaker 1>decay by failing to pay attention?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a little snake manifests itself </v>

89
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>inside your paradise.</v>
