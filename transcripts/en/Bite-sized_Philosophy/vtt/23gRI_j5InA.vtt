1
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.920
<v Speaker 1>So the blue fairy shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's nature.</v>

2
00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:08.921
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying is that nature will </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut kids a break if you think of nature </v>

3
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:10.460
<v Speaker 1>in the guise of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well their mother for example,</v>

4
00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:15.461
<v Speaker 1>but even the biology of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're wired to accept behavior </v>

5
00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:18.020
<v Speaker 1>from children that we wouldn't accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>from other people.</v>

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.440
<v Speaker 1>So nature will forgive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she shows up in your heavenly guys </v>

7
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.850
<v Speaker 1>and says what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Pinocchio again,</v>

8
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:31.340
<v Speaker 1>because he's naive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because he's not good.</v>

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.380
<v Speaker 1>He's not evil either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.990
<v Speaker 1>he's neither or both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you look at it.</v>

11
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.410
<v Speaker 1>And he also has no idea how smart he is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how smart he isn't or how smart the </v>

12
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>person he's talking to his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

13
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.450
<v Speaker 1>instead of admitting what he's done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lies about it.</v>

14
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:52.451
<v Speaker 1>And that's interesting because it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest that he understands at some </v>

15
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:56.090
<v Speaker 1>level that he set himself up for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

16
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>he could just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have just told the truth,</v>

17
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>this horrible Fox kidnap me and sold me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this slave holder.</v>

18
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Which is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot more true than the story he </v>

19
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.240
<v Speaker 1>tells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tells a story about some monster,</v>

20
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fictional monster.</v>

21
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>He coulda told even three quarters of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth and how to work,</v>

22
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:22.001
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just obscures the story entirely and </v>

23
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:25.511
<v Speaker 1>this is the part of the movie that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people remember and I'd edited this out </v>

24
00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 1>for years when I was talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

25
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what it was so significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His nose grows right and it grows too </v>

26
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:37.160
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous length.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>

27
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Mark Twain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samuel Clemens,</v>

28
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:49.301
<v Speaker 1>I think who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the advantages to telling the </v>

29
00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:52.541
<v Speaker 1>truth is that you don't have to remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you said and that God that's worth </v>

30
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:53.360
<v Speaker 1>listening to because.</v>

31
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of things I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned as a clinician and one of them </v>

32
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.191
<v Speaker 1>is because you're often in really weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations with people if you're a </v>

33
00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:07.580
<v Speaker 1>clinician because things happen that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't happen normally and you don't know</v>

34
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:12.581
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I've learned is I just say </v>

35
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:12.581
<v Speaker 1>what I just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening,</v>

36
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of what it is,</v>

37
00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:18.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just try to describe it as </v>

38
00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:19.100
<v Speaker 1>accurately as I can and not worry about </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

39
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:20.960
<v Speaker 1>not worried about the consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:22.790
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not going out of my way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause trouble.</v>

41
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:25.010
<v Speaker 1>But if you're in a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm telling you,</v>

42
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:30.011
<v Speaker 1>this can save your life at times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're dealing with </v>

43
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:30.011
<v Speaker 1>someone who's paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's really paranoid,</v>

44
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.130
<v Speaker 1>you do not lie to someone who's paranoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>and violent.</v>

45
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Because as soon as you lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aligned with the forces that are </v>

46
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.981
<v Speaker 1>persecuting them and they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>war because paranoid it makes people </v>

47
00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:42.260
<v Speaker 1>hypervigilant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're on amphetamines.</v>

48
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.590
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make people paranoid by giving </v>

49
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.991
<v Speaker 1>them enough and fed felonies and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>make paranoid people more paranoid by </v>

50
00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:53.861
<v Speaker 1>giving them amphetamines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're hypervigilant because they </v>

51
00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:54.620
<v Speaker 1>feel that everything is predatory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>against them.</v>

52
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>And so they're watching you like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would not believe way more than you're </v>

53
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.431
<v Speaker 1>watching them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you flicker ally while you're </v>

54
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>talking to them and they're really on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the edge,</v>

55
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

56
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>So it's what's one thing to really know </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're ever in a really bad situation</v>

57
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell the truth.</v>

58
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Minimally you don't disclose too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just another lie.</v>

59
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 1>You tell the truth minimally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully and hopefully,</v>

60
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>and you might get out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might get out of it,</v>

61
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.680
<v Speaker 1>but if you falsify it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look the hell out.</v>

62
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.040
<v Speaker 1>So the truth is a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real mechanism of protection in </v>

63
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.000
<v Speaker 1>dangerous situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

64
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.260
<v Speaker 1>So if someone's trying to intimidate you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

65
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.320
<v Speaker 1>you think they might get violent that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they asked you if you're afraid,</v>

66
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.770
<v Speaker 1>then you tell them that you're terrified</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you hope that things will go </v>

67
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.130
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you say,</v>

68
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One time I was in an airport and uh,</v>

69
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.060
<v Speaker 1>we're in this lineup to fly back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada that said international flights.</v>

70
00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:06.540
<v Speaker 1>And so as long line up like 50 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we got it,</v>

71
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.960
<v Speaker 1>I got about three from the front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was still like 40 people behind me </v>

72
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.961
<v Speaker 1>and the guy behind the counter decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was just going to shut down the </v>

73
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:15.390
<v Speaker 1>line and that we could all go to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>other line,</v>

74
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:20.391
<v Speaker 1>which was like 300 people long and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggested that he not do that because </v>

75
00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:25.341
<v Speaker 1>we'd been standing there for half an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour and that he could just deal with </v>

76
00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:27.240
<v Speaker 1>the 20 of us that were last and and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a clue.</v>

77
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>So he called the sheriff right away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this was down in Florida and it wasn't </v>

78
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.981
<v Speaker 1>that long after nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these guys came up and they were </v>

79
00:04:36.981 --> 00:04:40.221
<v Speaker 1>armed and they came and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at me because of course he told </v>

80
00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:42.210
<v Speaker 1>them that I was causing trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I wasn't.</v>

81
00:04:42.211 --> 00:04:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to not</v>

82
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.860
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

83
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>An arrogant bureaucratic scum rat take </v>

84
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.021
<v Speaker 1>advantage of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So which is not the same as causing </v>

85
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:56.021
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

86
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:57.080
<v Speaker 1>as soon as the cops came up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

87
00:04:57.081 --> 00:05:00.530
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do exactly what you tell me</v>

88
00:05:00.531 --> 00:05:03.530
<v Speaker 1>to do right now and I'm not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause any trouble,</v>

89
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.020
<v Speaker 1>but I would like you to hear what </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually happened.</v>

90
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good example of a situation </v>

91
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if someone's got,</v>

92
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bravo Bravado,</v>

93
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a very bad idea and I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do exactly what they told me because you</v>

94
00:05:18.411 --> 00:05:18.680
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

95
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know who I was and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what they had been told.</v>

96
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.410
<v Speaker 1>So anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with lying is that it's a </v>

97
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.980
<v Speaker 1>hydro and kids find this out very early </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

98
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:36.981
<v Speaker 1>You tell one lie and what happens is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has one of the consequences that you </v>

99
00:05:36.981 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you get away with it,</v>

100
00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>but it has three or four others that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't expect.</v>

101
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.820
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like it grows some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some complexity and then you have to </v>

102
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>tack a lie on each of those little </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity outcrops.</v>

103
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.560
<v Speaker 1>And then they grow three more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexities and soon this little light </v>

104
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.221
<v Speaker 1>turns into great big ball of lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at some point it becomes painfully </v>

105
00:05:56.221 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>evident to everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by that time you're in such,</v>

106
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.250
<v Speaker 1>you see this with politicians like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who was sexting with Anthony Wiener.</v>

107
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect name for him,</v>

108
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>

109
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't make that comment because </v>

110
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>it's so obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still funny,</v>

111
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

112
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what happened to him.</v>

113
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even so much the event </v>

114
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.250
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>people are stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make mistakes.</v>

116
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>And actually the public is somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgiving if you say,</v>

117
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

118
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm a real moron and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really seriously,</v>

119
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:28.850
<v Speaker 1>how could I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I did.</v>

120
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>And like I'll try not to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happens with politicians is,</v>

121
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not speaking specifically of </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>

122
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:41.171
<v Speaker 1>is they'll make an error and it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed and then they make three others </v>

123
00:06:41.171 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 1>trying to cover it up with Nixon for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

124
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:44.960
<v Speaker 1>And then the whole thing just turns into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complete scandal.</v>

125
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.200
<v Speaker 1>And maybe they could have got out of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning by just telling the </v>

126
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

127
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idiot.</v>

128
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try not to do it again.</v>

129
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what happens in this case in </v>

130
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.611
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio grows this elaborate series of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lies and the ferry is willing to be a </v>

131
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:10.961
<v Speaker 1>little generous to him because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>little and cute and he's still a puppet </v>

132
00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:14.320
<v Speaker 1>and she tells him not to do that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she's going to give them a pass </v>

133
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:21.131
<v Speaker 1>this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that she isn't going to be able to </v>

134
00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:21.131
<v Speaker 1>intervene on his behalf.</v>

135
00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:21.131
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>
