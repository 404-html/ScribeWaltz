1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.540
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I look at a political movement,</v>

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.560
<v Speaker 1>especially ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.950
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of things your for fine,</v>

4
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.470
<v Speaker 1>what are you against?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:15.650
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who adopted need theological position,</v>

6
00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:20.651
<v Speaker 1>like to presume is that all of the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>is on their site and that makes them </v>

7
00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:23.780
<v Speaker 1>very unconscious up their shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say from a union perspective.</v>

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis had all sorts of positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons for what they were doing,</v>

9
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative reasons were there too and </v>

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.151
<v Speaker 1>you could easily make it a case that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative reasons were really the </v>

11
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I look at video logs,</v>

12
00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I always think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

13
00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:39.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're for sure,</v>

14
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.030
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe all the good people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are on your site and be.</v>

15
00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:46.000
<v Speaker 1>I know that negative motivations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more powerful than positive ones.</v>

16
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.540
<v Speaker 1>So you say you're for things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're against them too.</v>

17
00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:51.310
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start with that.</v>

18
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.290
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I started thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this after I read George Orwell.</v>

19
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I love George Orwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

20
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.700
<v Speaker 1>How many of you know who George Orwell </v>
<v Speaker 1>is?</v>

21
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

22
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.720
<v Speaker 1>That's impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many don't.</v>

23
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

24
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

25
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.440
<v Speaker 1>How the hell did you learn about George </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orwell's?</v>

26
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 84.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

27
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:15.580
<v Speaker 1>or animal farm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animal Farm.</v>

28
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

29
00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Well that's good because George Orwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

30
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell was the first western </v>

31
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.400
<v Speaker 1>intellectual who figured out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell was going on in the Soviet Union.</v>

32
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.880
<v Speaker 1>And he did that in the mid forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early.</v>

33
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.080
<v Speaker 1>You know what was complicated because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of knew what was happening in the </v>

34
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.640
<v Speaker 1>twenties and the thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:35.140
<v Speaker 1>there was lennon and that wasn't so </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

36
00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:40.141
<v Speaker 1>There was the Russian civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was the idea of universal </v>

37
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:41.440
<v Speaker 1>communism that wasn't such a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:46.441
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as people who didn't want to be </v>

39
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:47.941
<v Speaker 1>communists were concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was what happened in the </v>

40
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:47.941
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine in the 1930.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like,</v>

41
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence was starting to pile up.</v>

42
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:54.751
<v Speaker 1>But unfortunately what happened was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish civil war and the lefties were </v>

43
00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:57.580
<v Speaker 1>pretty much the good guys in the Spanish</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil war.</v>

44
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a microcosm of the Second </v>

45
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.341
<v Speaker 1>World War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lefties were fighting the fascists </v>

46
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 1>and some of the lefties were communists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of them were also people who </v>

47
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.331
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think genuinely fighting for freedom </v>

48
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of North American literary </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures went to Spain to fight on the </v>

49
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.250
<v Speaker 1>side of the.</v>

50
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.790
<v Speaker 1>against the fascists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so fair enough,</v>

52
00:02:18.791 --> 00:02:20.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fascist were obviously,</v>

53
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible clearly and so and so that</v>

54
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:29.560
<v Speaker 1>kind of muddied the water right because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fastest were bad.</v>

55
00:02:29.561 --> 00:02:31.540
<v Speaker 1>And then that sort of means that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are fighting them,</v>

56
00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:34.180
<v Speaker 1>their garden and some of them are </v>
<v Speaker 1>communists and there was good.</v>

57
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 1>There was pretty good reason for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be radical socialist at that point in</v>

58
00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 1>human history because the plight of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>working man was relatively unpleasant.</v>

59
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell wrote a book called road </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Wigan Pier and he went up to this </v>

60
00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:54.181
<v Speaker 1>town that was a coal mining town and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stayed with the coal miners for </v>

61
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>awhile and just looked at their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

62
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:56.710
<v Speaker 1>here's a part of their life.</v>

63
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.300
<v Speaker 1>So you work at seven and a half hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>shift when you're a coal miner and you </v>

64
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.300
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

65
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>that's not too bad by 1930 standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

66
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:09.811
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except you have to go down to the coal </v>

67
00:03:09.811 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>mine tunnels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>and like they're not eight feet high and</v>
<v Speaker 1>carpeted there like four and a half feet</v>

69
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>high and rough and poorly lit and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ers terrible.</v>

70
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.720
<v Speaker 1>And so basically you have to chimp walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>or crawl up to three miles just to get </v>

71
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:32.761
<v Speaker 1>to work and then you have to do that at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of your shift and you don't get </v>

72
00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>paid for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>

73
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 1>that's your commute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

75
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:43.021
<v Speaker 1>it was no bloody well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course what you're doing </v>

76
00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:43.021
<v Speaker 1>when you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's absolutely filthy.</v>

77
00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably noisy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brutally difficult.</v>

78
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:48.590
<v Speaker 1>He said the coal miners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no teeth because they're like,</v>

79
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.910
<v Speaker 1>because of their living conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their bodies were absolutely </v>

80
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.910
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

81
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.360
<v Speaker 1>They were unbelievably powerful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong because all they did was </v>

82
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 1>incredibly intense physical labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was bloody rough.</v>

83
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.800
<v Speaker 1>And the housing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people had like 50 families for </v>

84
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:10.321
<v Speaker 1>one outhouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably good enough to describe </v>

85
00:04:10.321 --> 00:04:12.631
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often they were row houses and the </v>

86
00:04:12.631 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>row houses had no back doors that may </v>
<v Speaker 1>add no pass between them.</v>

87
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:19.441
<v Speaker 1>And all the old houses were at the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that meant if you were was like 20 </v>

88
00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>below and it was the winter and you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick,</v>

89
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:22.620
<v Speaker 1>then you get to go all the way around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the block to your damn.</v>

90
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I will tell us where maybe there's only </v>
<v Speaker 1>one there and you line up with 50 people</v>

91
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>so that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 1>So in order while he was orwell was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>upper class guy basically,</v>

93
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:36.840
<v Speaker 1>and he was trying to help themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome these upperclass prejudices who</v>

94
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:41.841
<v Speaker 1>is a real documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the terrible working conditions </v>

95
00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:41.841
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

96
00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>of working class people.</v>

97
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.390
<v Speaker 1>And he wrote this book called Road to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wigan Pier.</v>

98
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.430
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that or will said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote this story about these poor God</v>

99
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 1>damn coal miners and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

100
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:58.231
<v Speaker 1>it's like how about some social </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation so that these people and </v>

101
00:04:58.231 --> 00:04:59.600
<v Speaker 1>their children aren't just absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutalized nonstop.</v>

102
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he wrote the last half of the </v>

103
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 1>book and he wrote it for the left book </v>
<v Speaker 1>club,</v>

104
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>which was a socialist group that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>publish a book every month or so.</v>

105
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.320
<v Speaker 1>And what he did was he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a critique of socialism of </v>

106
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>pretty socialism and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

107
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 1>well this sucks man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we should be on the.</v>

108
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to these working people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the social assigned meet,</v>

109
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>they're not on the side of the working </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

110
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:27.001
<v Speaker 1>They're like tweed wearing middle class </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper intellectuals who never go </v>

111
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:28.960
<v Speaker 1>anywhere near the working class because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their class.</v>

112
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Prejudice isn't for all sorts of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons and they don't like the poor at </v>

113
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.020
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

114
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>They just hate the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought I had been a member of the</v>

115
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:38.620
<v Speaker 1>NDP for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point.</v>

116
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>It was always something a little off </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

117
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:45.151
<v Speaker 1>Especially the more radical kind that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you guys is it doesn't look like </v>

118
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 1>benevolence as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of whining and complaining</v>

119
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 1>and resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

120
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.610
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that about?</v>

121
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 1>I read Orwell and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

122
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.180
<v Speaker 1>if you hate the successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hate the rich,</v>

123
00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 1>who are rich by the way is whoever has </v>
<v Speaker 1>more money than you.</v>

124
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you define rich and the best </v>

125
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.591
<v Speaker 1>way to mask your resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to pretend that you're on the side </v>

126
00:06:11.591 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 1>of the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I read that.</v>

127
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:16.901
<v Speaker 1>I thought that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's part of also what made </v>

128
00:06:16.901 --> 00:06:19.991
<v Speaker 1>me psychoanalytically oriented because </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing psychoanalysts always do </v>

129
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.290
<v Speaker 1>always is if you say you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how I'm positively predisposed.</v>

130
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.730
<v Speaker 1>The psychoanalyst says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you using that to mask something</v>

131
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 1>easy and malevolent that you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's always.</v>

132
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very useful questions.</v>

133
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Not always correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

134
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.320
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's correct a lot more than people </v>

135
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>generally like to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:48.401
<v Speaker 1>it's like the mothering him grant the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother or the witch in Hansel and </v>

137
00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:48.401
<v Speaker 1>Gretel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the story,</v>

138
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy gets married,</v>

139
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 1>he's got a couple of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His new wife doesn't relate to the kids.</v>

140
00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.550
<v Speaker 1>You have 100 times higher chance by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of being abused by a step parent </v>

141
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 1>than the biological parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so you know,</v>

142
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.080
<v Speaker 1>so the step where they're just like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

143
00:07:05.081 --> 00:07:06.190
<v Speaker 1>she tells the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

144
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just go with those kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the woods,</v>

145
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:10.080
<v Speaker 1>sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go out in the woods.</v>

146
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 1>So they're lost kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

147
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 1>They have nowhere to go.</v>

148
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 1>So when they're wandering around out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the forest,</v>

149
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come across a gingerbread house.</v>

150
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow man,</v>

151
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 1>you're a starving kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just your bread house.</v>

152
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 1>That's good news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

153
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Not only is it a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's made out of candy.</v>

154
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 1>How could anything possibly be any </v>
<v Speaker 1>better?</v>

155
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.940
<v Speaker 1>So when they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

156
00:07:32.941 --> 00:07:36.250
<v Speaker 1>and then there's this grandmother type </v>
<v Speaker 1>type and you know,</v>

157
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 1>she's starts to fatten them up and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>puts,</v>

158
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it's handling the cage and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets settled after a while to basically </v>

159
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:49.421
<v Speaker 1>work as their scullery maid and equip </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes quite obvious to the children </v>

160
00:07:49.421 --> 00:07:52.511
<v Speaker 1>that she's actually fattening them up so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she can put them in the oven and </v>

161
00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:55.171
<v Speaker 1>eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think what Hansel does is I </v>

162
00:07:55.171 --> 00:07:57.610
<v Speaker 1>think gretel gives him this leg bone </v>
<v Speaker 1>from some animal and the old,</v>

163
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 1>which half blind and every time she </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaches into sort feel is laying,</v>

164
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:06.100
<v Speaker 1>he gives her the bone and so like she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just not all that interested in meeting </v>

165
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.511
<v Speaker 1>them in anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids ended up pushing her in the </v>

166
00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:10.511
<v Speaker 1>oven and closing it and getting the hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of there.</v>

167
00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:14.381
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a happy ending as far as fairy </v>

168
00:08:14.381 --> 00:08:14.381
<v Speaker 1>tales school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's an atypical story,</v>

169
00:08:14.381 --> 00:08:16.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic story,</v>

170
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:20.930
<v Speaker 1>but it needed whole family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be bloody wary of people who do too much</v>

171
00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

172
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you have a mother or any </v>
<v Speaker 1>other relatives for that matter,</v>

173
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.740
<v Speaker 1>who's fattening you up on mercy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>candy,</v>

174
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.640
<v Speaker 1>the probability that her basic goal is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat you enough so that you never </v>

175
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.081
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The probability is extraordinarily high </v>

176
00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>and that's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

177
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.750
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you do learn if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you read about the sorts of people who </v>

178
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.870
<v Speaker 1>burst out of their mother's basement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go shoot up Dawson colleges that often.</v>

179
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.030
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the situation that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

180
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.450
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're burning with resentment in their</v>

181
00:08:57.451 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 1>uselessness down in the basement for </v>
<v Speaker 1>five or six years,</v>

182
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to leave,</v>

183
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to become independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's done for them.</v>

184
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 1>So they never have to do anything for </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

185
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the rules for dealing with</v>

186
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:18.051
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know this is actually a rule for </v>

187
00:09:18.051 --> 00:09:18.051
<v Speaker 1>dealing with elderly people in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

188
00:09:18.051 --> 00:09:18.051
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

189
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 1>in hopes for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

190
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:25.100
<v Speaker 1>for retired people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is do not do anything for anyone they </v>

191
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:25.100
<v Speaker 1>can do for themselves.</v>

192
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 1>You are stealing from them when you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

193
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's a great rule of thumb for kits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like once they can dress themselves,</v>

194
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.970
<v Speaker 1>they dress themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they can set the table,</v>

195
00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 1>even if it takes 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're setting the table.</v>

196
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.700
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing them a favor by helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>them do anything they can do themselves </v>

197
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.180
<v Speaker 1>and it gets Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda harsh,</v>

198
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:47.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it beats the hell out of the witch </v>

199
00:09:47.181 --> 00:09:47.181
<v Speaker 1>in Hansel and Gretel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

200
00:09:47.181 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we're going to look at</v>

201
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:50.790
<v Speaker 1>as well as the dark side of positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations.</v>
