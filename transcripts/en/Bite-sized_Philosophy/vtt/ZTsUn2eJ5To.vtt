1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Speaker 1>And the Lord said unto Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.830
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the opening of the story,</v>

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.040
<v Speaker 1>get thee out of thy country and from thy</v>
<v Speaker 1>kindred and from thy Father's House unto</v>

4
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:16.221
<v Speaker 1>a land that I will show thee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of those phrases where </v>

5
00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:19.941
<v Speaker 1>every clause is significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go somewhere you don't understand.</v>

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the out of country.</v>

7
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the 19 twenties,</v>

8
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:30.441
<v Speaker 1>there was a whole slew of American </v>
<v Speaker 1>writers who ended up as expatriates in </v>

9
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway among them,</v>

10
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>who wrote the Great Gatsby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fitzgerald,</v>

11
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:37.380
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a variety of others.</v>

12
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:42.381
<v Speaker 1>It was very inexpensive in Paris at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and part of their transformation </v>

13
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:47.001
<v Speaker 1>into great literary figures was the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were out of their country and </v>

14
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:47.001
<v Speaker 1>now they could see what their country </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

15
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Because you can't see what your country </v>
<v Speaker 1>is until you leave it.</v>

16
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.040
<v Speaker 1>So you have to go into the unknown and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's God's first command.</v>

17
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Go into the unknown because you already </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what you know and so,</v>

18
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>and that's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you think you're enough.</v>

19
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not enough and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're enough,</v>

20
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>then you have to go where you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>

21
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the first commandment to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham.</v>

22
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

23
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one.</v>

24
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>That makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to where you don't know.</v>

25
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from thy kindred will though,</v>

26
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>does that mean it means grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

27
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means get away from your family </v>

28
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>enough so that you can establish your </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>

29
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>And that isn't because there's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with your family,</v>

30
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:26.110
<v Speaker 1>although perhaps there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>as long as there is perhaps wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

32
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>but it means get away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

33
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.650
<v Speaker 1>I talked to people very frequently whose</v>
<v Speaker 1>families have provided them with too </v>

34
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>much protection and they know it </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

35
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>And that means they are deprived of </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity.</v>

36
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you see in,</v>

37
00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States for example,</v>

38
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:49.221
<v Speaker 1>is that the children are first </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation immigrants often do better </v>

39
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:54.081
<v Speaker 1>than the children that their children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that the </v>

40
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 1>children are first generation </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants,</v>

41
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:59.751
<v Speaker 1>have necessity driving them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't know how much you need </v>

42
00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:02.991
<v Speaker 1>necessity to drive you because maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not very disciplined and if any </v>

43
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe doesn't immediately be fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

44
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>If you don't act forthrightly today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you never act forthrightly,</v>

45
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the,</v>

46
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.200
<v Speaker 1>the gap between your foolishness and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment is,</v>

47
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 1>is lengthened by your unearned wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you never grow up and learn and </v>

48
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.851
<v Speaker 1>you have to get yourself away from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependency in order to allow necessity </v>

49
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:28.431
<v Speaker 1>to drive you forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's to become independent and to </v>

50
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:28.431
<v Speaker 1>become mature.</v>

51
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of what's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture is that the,</v>

52
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the force that's attacking the </v>

53
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.060
<v Speaker 1>forthright movement forward of young men</v>
<v Speaker 1>in particular is afraid of the power of </v>

54
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:46.551
<v Speaker 1>man because it's confused about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between power and authority </v>

55
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:51.801
<v Speaker 1>and competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know a man who's who has </v>

56
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:54.570
<v Speaker 1>authority and competence has power as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>byproduct,</v>

57
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>but the authority and competence is </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

58
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.650
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

59
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>and people who can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fail to make the distinction </v>

60
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 1>between power and authority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>

61
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:10.021
<v Speaker 1>And they're afraid of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they destroy authority and </v>

62
00:03:10.021 --> 00:03:12.841
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a terrible thing because we </v>

63
00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:12.841
<v Speaker 1>need authority and competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else is going to,</v>

64
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>what else is going to allow us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevail in the long run?</v>

65
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.680
<v Speaker 1>And so you get away from your country </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get away from your kin and from </v>

66
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>your father's house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

67
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>And you go out there and you establish </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in the world.</v>

68
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:29.971
<v Speaker 1>It's a call to adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this first lines in the </v>

69
00:03:29.971 --> 00:03:33.871
<v Speaker 1>Abrahamic story is a call to adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So great unto a land that I will show </v>

70
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

71
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

72
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've been struck </v>

73
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>very hard by a number of writers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young,</v>

74
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.330
<v Speaker 1>obviously among them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

75
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>he wrote things like Nicha that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand them,</v>

76
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>they just break you into pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

77
00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that young </v>

78
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>understood in the psychoanalysts </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

79
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most terrifying elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>of psychoanalytic thinking is very </v>

80
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.491
<v Speaker 1>tightly allied with religious thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that you are not the master of </v>

81
00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:12.661
<v Speaker 1>your own house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are spirits that dwell in you </v>

82
00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>within you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning you have a will,</v>

83
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>and you can exercise a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious control over your being,</v>

84
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:23.881
<v Speaker 1>but there are all sorts of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>occur within you that seem to be beyond </v>

85
00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 1>your capacity to control your dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>

86
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good example of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses.</v>

87
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might,</v>

88
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>you might think of those as so foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>from you that they're not even.</v>

89
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't even want them to be part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

90
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more subtly even.</v>

91
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>How about what you're interested in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What compels you?</v>

92
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does that come from?</v>

93
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can't,</v>

94
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 1>you can't conjure it up of your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>accord,</v>

95
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:47.170
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a student and you're taking</v>

96
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>difficult course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say to yourself,</v>

97
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to sit down and study for three </v>

98
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.431
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you sit down and that is what </v>

99
00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:56.431
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your attention goes everywhere.</v>

100
00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

101
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>whose attention is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>

102
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 1>If it goes everywhere because you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your attention,</v>

103
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

104
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's your attention,</v>

105
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'd be able to control it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't,</v>

106
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.340
<v Speaker 1>and so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well jen and just exactly what the hell </v>

107
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.340
<v Speaker 1>is controlling it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>

108
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's random.</v>

109
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 1>It's the better not be random.</v>

110
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens to some degree in </v>

111
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.541
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an element of randomness in </v>

112
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:21.541
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not random.</v>

113
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:26.100
<v Speaker 1>It's driven by the action of of </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena that I think are best </v>

114
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.600
<v Speaker 1>considered as something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities.</v>

115
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.340
<v Speaker 1>They'll even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's only a partial description.</v>

116
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 1>You can't make yourself interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

117
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Interest manifests itself in grips you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different thing and so </v>

118
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 1>what is it that's gripping you and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you conceptualize that?</v>

119
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Is that a divine power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

120
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:52.591
<v Speaker 1>it's divine as far as you're concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it grips you and you can't do </v>

121
00:05:52.591 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>anything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there is a calling in you towards</v>

122
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 1>what you're compelled by and what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in,</v>

123
00:05:56.891 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes that might be very dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes not,</v>

124
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 1>but you're compelled forward by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

125
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.770
<v Speaker 1>And so and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that what moves you away from </v>

126
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 1>your country and your father's house and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comforts of your childhood home is,</v>

127
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>is something that's beyond you and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you listen to an Harken to.</v>

128
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>

129
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to call it that God.</v>

130
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like it doesn't matter what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>call it.</v>

131
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter to what it is,</v>

132
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It still is,</v>

133
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.180
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing.</v>

134
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.480
<v Speaker 1>If you don't listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've been a clinician and talked to </v>

135
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>enough people now as old as I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know this.</v>

136
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:42.881
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do not listen to that thing that </v>

137
00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:45.431
<v Speaker 1>beckons you forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will pay for it like you cannot </v>

138
00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:48.310
<v Speaker 1>possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have everything that's terrible </v>

139
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 1>about life in your life and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it that's good and worse.</v>

140
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>You'll know that it was your fault and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you squandered what you could have </v>

141
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>
