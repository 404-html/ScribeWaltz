1
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>People even now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the 100th anniversary of </v>

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.660
<v Speaker 1>the Russian revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are celebrating Lennon.</v>

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 1>That's like celebrating Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:16.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good,</v>

6
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that people can dare to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that that's okay means that </v>

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.460
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we look at history.</v>

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Lennon was a monster and if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about that,</v>

9
00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:33.661
<v Speaker 1>you can read Solzhenitsyn's writings </v>
<v Speaker 1>about lending because they communist </v>

10
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:33.661
<v Speaker 1>apologists say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

11
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:35.050
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't landing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Len was a good guy.</v>

12
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>He was all motivated by love of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>working class.</v>

13
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

14
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.030
<v Speaker 1>his henchmen was stolen and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hansman is Stellan,</v>

15
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>you're not a good guy and lender who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>around during the early collectivization</v>

16
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>and if you read what he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find out that he is perfectly </v>

17
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.021
<v Speaker 1>willing to have any number of people die</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as his ideological system could </v>

18
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 1>be brought into big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no celebrating Lennon.</v>

19
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>There's no work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool young Marxist hip revolutionaries </v>

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>and he's our idol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's none of that.</v>

21
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Not if you know anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not if you're decent,</v>

22
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.900
<v Speaker 1>whether it's death of the Kulaks I told </v>
<v Speaker 1>you about that there was the Ukrainian </v>

23
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 1>famine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 6 million gone there.</v>

24
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>There was the rise of the Gulag state </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it turned out that Russia,</v>

25
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.170
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union couldn't run on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles that it had that had,</v>

26
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:31.310
<v Speaker 1>had a laid down as sacrosanct that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't work.</v>

27
00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:34.220
<v Speaker 1>So he had to enslave everybody and run </v>
<v Speaker 1>your economy</v>

28
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 1>as a slave state essentially.</v>

29
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>And try not to kill the people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gulags so fast that you can't suck some </v>

30
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>productive labor out of them is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>death of tens of millions of people.</v>

31
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know the estimates range </v>
<v Speaker 1>from 15 to $60 million and like we won't</v>

32
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:59.571
<v Speaker 1>get it to Picayune about the numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>because after the first 10 million you </v>

33
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:03.381
<v Speaker 1>kinda made your point and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know between 15 and 60 is </v>

34
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>actually an indication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

35
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>of the horror of it because our count is</v>
<v Speaker 1>off by tens of millions and that's only </v>

36
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.870
<v Speaker 1>within the last century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was the 1956 crackdown on</v>

37
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Hungary and the 1968 invasion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Czechoslovakia.</v>

38
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Then there was the whole like thermo </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear Holocaust thing that was going </v>

39
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.230
<v Speaker 1>on at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that in 1962 and in 1984,</v>

40
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.070
<v Speaker 1>we were seconds away from complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>annihilation,</v>

41
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:39.071
<v Speaker 1>right during the Cuban missile crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the keys were in the intercontinental </v>

42
00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:42.020
<v Speaker 1>ballistic missile release systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Castro,</v>

43
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.250
<v Speaker 1>as he admitted to Jimmy Carter in case </v>
<v Speaker 1>any of you are Castro fans,</v>

44
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.670
<v Speaker 1>which you shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was perfectly willing to have </v>

45
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Cuba annihilated if it would've meant </v>
<v Speaker 1>the defeat of the United States.</v>

46
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.250
<v Speaker 1>And then in 1984 approximately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may have the date exactly wrong,</v>

47
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>the Russians received an indication from</v>
<v Speaker 1>their early warning systems that the </v>

48
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.691
<v Speaker 1>Americans had launched five Thurman </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear Missiles and one Russian decided</v>

49
00:03:12.171 --> 00:03:15.830
<v Speaker 1>that it was a mistake and refused to </v>
<v Speaker 1>launch the retaliation.</v>

50
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.400
<v Speaker 1>And he just died about two weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

51
00:03:19.401 --> 00:03:21.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty close.</v>

52
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.120
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was experiment number one.</v>

53
00:03:26.121 --> 00:03:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that that wasn't good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that experiment,</v>

54
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.750
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't good.</v>

55
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>It was exactly the antithesis of good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was precisely the antithesis of good,</v>

56
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.210
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

57
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.350
<v Speaker 1>there's the People's Republic of China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different country,</v>

58
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.940
<v Speaker 1>like seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different country,</v>

59
00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:48.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different tradition,</v>

60
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.550
<v Speaker 1>different language.</v>

61
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.900
<v Speaker 1>How many people died in China under Mao?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows.</v>

62
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Same issue with the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although mile was a bigger monster than </v>

63
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Stalin and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's impressive.</v>

64
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's Hitler,</v>

65
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.210
<v Speaker 1>there's Stalin and Mao and of the three </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile was probably the worst.</v>

66
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.690
<v Speaker 1>He's still revered in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that accounts for their affinity </v>

67
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.650
<v Speaker 1>for North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could still destroy us.</v>

68
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:24.651
<v Speaker 1>All the remnants of that horrible state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a 100 million people died in China</v>

69
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.730
<v Speaker 1>during the great leap forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a leap forward.</v>

70
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it wasn't a 100 million,</v>

71
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:33.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was only $40 million,</v>

72
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.300
<v Speaker 1>but as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're counting in the tens of </v>

73
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.321
<v Speaker 1>millions of your points already made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there was Cambodia and the </v>

74
00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:46.161
<v Speaker 1>killing fields and Bulgaria and east </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany and Romania and the Democratic </v>

75
00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:51.020
<v Speaker 1>People's Republic of Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's North Korea and Vietnam and </v>

76
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungary,</v>

77
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.110
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

78
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.170
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was never a successful communist </v>

79
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.700
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

80
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came closest,</v>

81
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 1>but it was radically,</v>

82
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

83
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.960
<v Speaker 1>the Soviets poured money into Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that doesn't really count.</v>

84
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.650
<v Speaker 1>So then the first question was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

85
00:05:12.651 --> 00:05:16.800
<v Speaker 1>are these Marxists motivated by love or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hatred?</v>

86
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

87
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.080
<v Speaker 1>is it love or hatred that produces $100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dead people?</v>

88
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Is that enough evidence or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not enough evidence,</v>

89
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 1>if you think to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

90
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>that's not enough evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was never really given its proper,</v>

91
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 2>a proper try.</v>

92
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:41.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

93
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.930
<v Speaker 1>why would have been a proper try to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think when I hear someone say </v>

94
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.870
<v Speaker 1>that I know what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think in your delusional arrogance,</v>

95
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.130
<v Speaker 1>that you understand the Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrines better than anyone else ever </v>

96
00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.191
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that if you were one implementing </v>

97
00:06:00.191 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 1>those doctrines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have ushered in the utopia.</v>

98
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what you mean when you say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and no,</v>

99
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.370
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They saying there's an idea in the new </v>

100
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.670
<v Speaker 1>testament that there is a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sin against the holy ghost.</v>

101
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 1>If you commit that sand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one really knows what it is that you </v>

102
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.060
<v Speaker 1>can't be forgiven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say,</v>

103
00:06:22.061 --> 00:06:27.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want a candidate for the sin </v>

104
00:06:27.061 --> 00:06:27.580
<v Speaker 1>against the Holy Ghost and the 21st </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

105
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.730
<v Speaker 1>the statement communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real communism was never tried with the </v>

106
00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:40.771
<v Speaker 1>underlying idea that if you had been the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person implementing it would have </v>

107
00:06:40.771 --> 00:06:43.780
<v Speaker 1>worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's pretty good contender for</v>

108
00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:46.000
<v Speaker 1>something for which you should never be </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgiven.</v>
