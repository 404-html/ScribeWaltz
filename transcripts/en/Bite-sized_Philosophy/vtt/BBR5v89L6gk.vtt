00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.620
<v Speaker 1>How the as as a message to people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are watching this and trying to work </v>

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.311
<v Speaker 1>their way through a lot of young people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who were trying to navigate this </v>

3
00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:11.801
<v Speaker 1>increasingly perilous minefield of </v>
<v Speaker 1>divisive politics.</v>

4
00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>In today's Day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they know?</v>

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 1>What are the heuristics they use?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the signposts they used to </v>

6
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.430
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I on the right path?</v>

7
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Is is what I'm being taught or is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being attracted to politically </v>

8
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.630
<v Speaker 1>motivated from a sense of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually best for the community that I'm</v>

9
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Speaker 1>nominally caring for?</v>

10
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that requires.</v>

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.400
<v Speaker 2>It might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that requires careful meditation </v>

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.560
<v Speaker 2>and prayer if you want it to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional about it.</v>

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I would say you have to Orient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to determine this is a process </v>

14
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.060
<v Speaker 2>of soul searching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you oriented towards?</v>

15
00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 2>And the answer could easily be nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

16
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.170
<v Speaker 2>this is why I produced the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoring program.</v>

17
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Like you've got to be oriented towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>something because otherwise you're </v>

18
00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.860
<v Speaker 2>disoriented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just spin around in circles and then</v>

19
00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:02.080
<v Speaker 2>you suffer and sort of people around </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

20
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orient itself towards something.</v>

21
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.290
<v Speaker 2>You have to figure out what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will work for you,</v>

22
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 2>what goal would would justify the </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering of your life.</v>

23
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Start trying to piece that together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get better at it,</v>

24
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's a personal process and and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should use your education to inform that</v>

25
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:26.731
<v Speaker 2>so you need a personal place to stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise you're going to be </v>

26
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:29.851
<v Speaker 2>handed a place to stand on a plate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it may be one that that makes you a </v>

27
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 2>puppet of someone else's goals.</v>

28
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.680
<v Speaker 2>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.110
<v Speaker 2>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the processes?</v>

30
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what I've recommended to people </v>

31
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.270
<v Speaker 2>is clean up your room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good start.</v>

32
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Organize your local landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Schedule your time,</v>

33
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 2>start taking control of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you can stop saying things you </v>

34
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.711
<v Speaker 2>know to be lies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the same as telling the </v>

35
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:58.591
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to do that to begin with </v>

36
00:01:58.591 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 2>because you're not good enough at it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>even attempt it in some sense,</v>

37
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Speaker 2>but everyone can stop saying things they</v>
<v Speaker 2>know to be false hoods.</v>

38
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.350
<v Speaker 2>They can use their own damn definition </v>
<v Speaker 2>of falsehood,</v>

39
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in your definition,</v>

40
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in your definition,</v>

41
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>falsehood includes the higher level </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral truth,</v>

42
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 1>living wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say something that is literally </v>

43
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course,</v>

44
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.011
<v Speaker 1>like you said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a black truth in the sense that at </v>

45
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.711
<v Speaker 1>a moral level you're saying something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause a social effect that is actually </v>

46
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

47
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.450
<v Speaker 2>stop saying things that violate your </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience.</v>

48
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.440
<v Speaker 2>Instead of stop saying things you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be untrue,</v>

49
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.870
<v Speaker 2>because we run into the truth problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would say,</v>

50
00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:39.310
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's another idea.</v>

51
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Stop saying and doing things that make </v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel weak is all you have to do is </v>

52
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.141
<v Speaker 2>pay attention to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some things you do will make you feel </v>

53
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 2>disintegrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a physiological sensation </v>

54
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.750
<v Speaker 2>disintegrated in week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that Carl Rogers </v>

55
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.120
<v Speaker 2>commented on and he thought about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>as part of,</v>

56
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.580
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I can't remember the word.</v>

57
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't the word he used,</v>

58
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 2>but some things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some things improve your integrity on.</v>

59
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:11.311
<v Speaker 2>Some things disintegrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You now the things that disintegrate </v>

60
00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:15.001
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you often do to impress other people or </v>

61
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 2>because you're taking a shortcut or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're escaping what you know to be your</v>

62
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:21.481
<v Speaker 2>moral obligation and your moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligation stems naturally from your </v>

63
00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 2>aims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like once once you have aims,</v>

64
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 2>you have moral obligations.</v>

65
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.490
<v Speaker 2>They come together because the moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligation is what you need to do in </v>

66
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 2>order to obtain the Ame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and if you don't have a name,</v>

67
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 2>well then you're aimless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's not a solution.</v>

68
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 2>So along with the aims come the moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligations.</v>

69
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Then when you violate the moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligations,</v>

70
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 2>you'll have a sense of that violation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

71
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:42.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to stop doing that or,</v>

72
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 2>or that's something you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to.</v>

73
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.010
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do any of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say that's where where </v>

74
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 2>people should start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start small.</v>

75
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 2>It's not small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think it's small.</v>

76
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a girl come up to me last night at</v>

77
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 2>the end of my talk and this happens all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

78
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.670
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started cleaning up my room last year </v>

79
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 2>and it completely changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

80
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 2>your room is an externalization of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>

81
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 2>and that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly true to the degree that </v>

82
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 2>you're in your room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the room is,</v>

83
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't how people think,</v>

84
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.100
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if they think that </v>

85
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.100
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it is.</v>

86
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.900
<v Speaker 2>So straighten up what you can straighten</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and quit saying things that make you </v>

87
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 2>feel weak and then then you'll know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do next.</v>
