1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Known territory or what's exploring </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown territory or what's not </v>

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.541
<v Speaker 1>explored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Trans transformation or the </v>

3
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:11.080
<v Speaker 1>dissolution of one into the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the reconstitution of that.</v>

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the election does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

6
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>we have our leader who's the person at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of the dominance hierarchy and </v>

7
00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:22.960
<v Speaker 1>defines the nature of this particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

8
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>There's an election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's regulated chaos.</v>

9
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:29.200
<v Speaker 1>No one knows what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the death of the old king.</v>

10
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go into a chaotic state.</v>

11
00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:36.511
<v Speaker 1>Everyone argues for awhile and then out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that argument they produce a </v>

12
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.110
<v Speaker 1>consensus and Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in a new state,</v>

13
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Meta story,</v>

14
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Order,</v>

15
00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:44.170
<v Speaker 1>chaos order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's partial order,</v>

16
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.180
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reconstituted,</v>

17
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:51.181
<v Speaker 1>and revivified order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is that this order is </v>

18
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:54.721
<v Speaker 1>better than that order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's progress and that's partly </v>

19
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.320
<v Speaker 1>why I think the idea of moral relativism</v>
<v Speaker 1>is wrong.</v>

20
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.180
<v Speaker 1>There's progress in moral order and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was defined property by piaget.</v>

21
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>The new moral order does everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other moral,</v>

22
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 1>the old moral order did and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>additional things.</v>

23
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.520
<v Speaker 1>That's what constitutes progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

24
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>here's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a strange idea and we'll talk </v>

25
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.430
<v Speaker 1>about this more as we progress through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the class.</v>

26
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.350
<v Speaker 1>What's the ultimate in order?</v>

27
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not there,</v>

28
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:25.541
<v Speaker 1>so obviously because it can collapse and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not this because it can collapse </v>

29
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 1>and so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>there's no ultimate order even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's progression,</v>

31
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>but then you have to move it up one </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of abstraction.</v>

32
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>What's the ultimate order doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>willingness to do that?</v>

33
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the ultimate order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:47.421
<v Speaker 1>It's order at a different level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis and you can see that's what's </v>

35
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 1>represented in that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that idea means.</v>

36
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>That's the Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:56.181
<v Speaker 1>The Phoenix is something that lives ages</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then allows itself to be consumed by</v>

38
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Speaker 1>fire and then reemerge us and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled.</v>

39
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Phoenix gets old and Burns and the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>phoenix reemergence,</v>

40
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:09.411
<v Speaker 1>and so the real phoenix is the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's constant across those </v>

41
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the union self.</v>

42
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what he meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The self is the element of the psyche </v>

43
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>that remains intact across </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations.</v>

44
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a bloody amazing idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure,</v>

46
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>and you could think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you haven't claimed,</v>

47
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:33.891
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in ion primarily that Christ was a </v>

48
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>symbol of the self that was his</v>

49
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.560
<v Speaker 1>consequence of decades of meditation on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure of Christianity because </v>

50
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.350
<v Speaker 1>it's the dying and resurrecting part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the psyche that remains constant across </v>

51
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.371
<v Speaker 1>the the transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the ultimate order isn't to identify </v>

52
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:58.041
<v Speaker 1>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your current state of being and </v>

53
00:02:58.041 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 1>it isn't tied into fight with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

54
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.170
<v Speaker 1>well you can't by definition and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't even to identify with that.</v>

55
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>It's to let these things go as they need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go.</v>

56
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a sacrifice and to allow this </v>
<v Speaker 1>continual process of transformation to </v>

57
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>occur and part of that is the admission </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're wrong.</v>

58
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.780
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what you're doing is at </v>
<v Speaker 1>micro levels and macro levels where are </v>

59
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:27.151
<v Speaker 1>you not what you could be and when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that it'll take you apart a </v>

60
00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:31.681
<v Speaker 1>little bit and burn you down to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>core a little bit and then allow you to </v>

61
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>regenerate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that continually,</v>

62
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>the everything that you don't need burns</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

63
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what this means.</v>

64
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>You remember in Harry Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may remember that Harry goes down,</v>

65
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>so in the second volume and in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second movie,</v>

66
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Harry's at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's the school where you learn how </v>

67
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.210
<v Speaker 1>to be magic because that's what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really are,</v>

68
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>and there's something that threatens the</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

69
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what threatens the school.</v>

70
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Voldemort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing,</v>

72
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.240
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the snake that lurks </v>

73
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.581
<v Speaker 1>underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the basilisk that that threatens </v>

74
00:04:11.581 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 1>the school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the Basilisk is the dragon,</v>

75
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:17.611
<v Speaker 1>and when the Basler looks at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're paralyzed because you're a </v>

76
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:21.331
<v Speaker 1>prey animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if a Predator captures you in its </v>

77
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 1>gaze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you freeze.</v>

78
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:26.431
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you freeze is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body reacts to the Predator as </v>

79
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>something that should turn you to stone </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain about that.</v>

80
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.410
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do about the bass list?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:42.411
<v Speaker 1>one thing you do is you run and hide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other thing you do is go </v>

82
00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:44.340
<v Speaker 1>confronted and insulator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what Harry Potter does now.</v>

83
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.550
<v Speaker 1>And what's interesting about him is he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>also touched by evil,</v>

84
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that he's an embodiment </v>

85
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.191
<v Speaker 1>of what you would regard as someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's integrated the shadow and without </v>

86
00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:56.310
<v Speaker 1>that capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't able to communicate,</v>

87
00:04:56.311 --> 00:05:01.311
<v Speaker 1>say with snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not so good because since </v>

88
00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:04.071
<v Speaker 1>there are snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not such a bad idea to know how to </v>

89
00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:05.520
<v Speaker 1>communicate with them and he goes down </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the underground,</v>

90
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:10.521
<v Speaker 1>right into the chaotic domain that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the school in order to find </v>

91
00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:10.521
<v Speaker 1>the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's layer.</v>

92
00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

93
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:16.551
<v Speaker 1>you can you tell me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't need go down through a </v>

94
00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:16.620
<v Speaker 1>bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a toilet.</v>

95
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

96
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's an indication of the union </v>

97
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.520
<v Speaker 1>dictum that where are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you most,</v>

98
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.430
<v Speaker 1>what you need most is to be found where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you least want to look.</v>

99
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.950
<v Speaker 1>I had a client once who actually had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream like that.</v>

100
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.120
<v Speaker 1>He dreamt that he had to go into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underground world through an outhouse.</v>

101
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was very,</v>

102
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:39.831
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was an elaboration of precisely </v>

103
00:05:39.831 --> 00:05:43.041
<v Speaker 1>this theme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what you've thrown away as of </v>

104
00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:45.711
<v Speaker 1>little value to you and maybe what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate and hold in contempt and fear is </v>

105
00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:50.421
<v Speaker 1>exactly what you have to face if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go down to the place where the </v>

106
00:05:50.421 --> 00:05:51.690
<v Speaker 1>transformations occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens in Harry Potter,</v>

107
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>while this Bass licks his wandering </v>
<v Speaker 1>around paralyzing everyone who isn't </v>

108
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>able to communicate with snakes and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't fight the basslink precisely.</v>

109
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>It goes down into its layers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the underground world,</v>

110
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.600
<v Speaker 1>and that what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what down there is that snake has got a </v>

111
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Vra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

112
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 1>His girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's her name,</v>

113
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

114
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a variant of Virginia that's a </v>

115
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.430
<v Speaker 1>variant of virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the snake always has a virgin.</v>

116
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.490
<v Speaker 1>That's one of its characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

117
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Like gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes down there to rescue her.</v>

118
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 1>What happens to him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets bit and he's going to die.</v>

119
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.650
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Phoenix comes along and cries tears </v>

120
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>into his wounds and charism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's</v>

121
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.830
<v Speaker 1>so the idea is that what saves you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the encounter with the snake is your </v>

122
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>capacity to let things go and die and </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back to life.</v>

123
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

124
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.620
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting a that that story's </v>
<v Speaker 1>told in that way,</v>

125
00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:53.320
<v Speaker 1>in that series of volumes because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

126
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

127
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plot structure is perfect in a </v>

128
00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.710
<v Speaker 1>mythological sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly right.</v>

129
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.850
<v Speaker 1>And the Phoenix APP actually happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the pat of the main wizard,</v>

130
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.040
<v Speaker 1>which is also perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly right.</v>

131
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:07.890
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

132
00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:08.560
<v Speaker 1>The WHO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>

133
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Dumbledore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

134
00:07:09.791 --> 00:07:11.800
<v Speaker 1>He's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>

135
00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:14.320
<v Speaker 1>God the father and his pat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

136
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.710
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his close ally is the thing that can die</v>

137
00:07:17.711 --> 00:07:22.711
<v Speaker 1>and that transforms well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see the echoes of Christian </v>

138
00:07:22.711 --> 00:07:24.340
<v Speaker 1>thought in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't exactly right.</v>

139
00:07:24.341 --> 00:07:29.230
<v Speaker 1>It's the Christian thought and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological substructure upon which the</v>

140
00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:34.231
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter volume is based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are drawing from the same underlying </v>

141
00:07:34.231 --> 00:07:37.591
<v Speaker 1>pool of ideas and symbols and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>universally accessible and you can tell </v>

142
00:07:38.051 --> 00:07:43.051
<v Speaker 1>that because if they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that book wouldn't have sold how many </v>

143
00:07:43.051 --> 00:07:43.900
<v Speaker 1>million copies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many million copies did it sell,</v>

144
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.560
<v Speaker 1>and the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's unbelievably overwhelmingly </v>

145
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.520
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got kids to read 600 page books,</v>

146
00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:53.980
<v Speaker 1>like multiple volumes lining up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

147
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.930
<v Speaker 1>You got to ask yourself why silly </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about magical orphans.</v>

148
00:07:59.050 --> 00:07:59.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

149
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.470
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe people aren't so stupid,</v>

150
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.150
<v Speaker 1>and certainly if they happen to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading relatively complex books,</v>

151
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.230
<v Speaker 1>attributing that to stupidity seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be rather counterproductive.</v>
