1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.450
<v Speaker 1>There's this idea in union psychology </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the circumambulation and young </v>

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.861
<v Speaker 1>had this idea that you had a potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>future self which would be in potential </v>

3
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:15.741
<v Speaker 1>everything that you could be and that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself moment to moment in </v>

4
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>your present life by making you </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in things and the things that</v>

5
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:25.521
<v Speaker 1>you're interested in are the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would guide you along the path that </v>

6
00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:28.941
<v Speaker 1>would lead you to maximal development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it sounds like a metaphysical idea </v>

7
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>or a or a mystical idea even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

8
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

9
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a really profoundly biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

10
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>The idea is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.880
<v Speaker 1>your setup so that you're automatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in those things that was </v>

12
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>fully expand you as a well adapted </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature.</v>

13
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's nothing radical about that </v>

14
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How else,</v>

15
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.770
<v Speaker 1>what else could possibly be the case </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless there's something fundamentally </v>

16
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>flawed about you that is what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation would be.</v>

17
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how that would be manifest moment to </v>

18
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is something like,</v>

19
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your interest is captured by those </v>

20
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.150
<v Speaker 1>things that lead you down the path of </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

21
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Will that better be the case?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

22
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:15.351
<v Speaker 1>so that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's some utility in pursuing </v>

23
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>those things that you're interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the call to adventure,</v>

24
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:21.351
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the call to adventure takes you </v>

25
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:24.861
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with the call to </v>

26
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:24.861
<v Speaker 1>adventure is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you know?</v>

27
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:29.690
<v Speaker 1>You might be interested in things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are kind of warped and bent and often </v>

28
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.191
<v Speaker 1>it's the case that when new parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people manifest themselves and grip </v>

29
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:39.171
<v Speaker 1>their interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say they do it very badly and shoddily </v>

30
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>and so you stumble around like an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you try to do something new,</v>

31
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>that's where the fool is the precursor </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the savior from the,</v>

32
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.650
<v Speaker 1>from the symbolic perspectives.</v>

33
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Because you have to be a fool before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be a master and if you're not </v>

34
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.650
<v Speaker 1>willing to be a fool and you can't be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>master,</v>

35
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.541
<v Speaker 1>so so you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an error error ridden process and </v>

36
00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:02.691
<v Speaker 1>that's also laid out the old testament </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories because the first thing that </v>

37
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:02.691
<v Speaker 1>happens to all these patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures,</v>

38
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>when God kicks them out of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>father's house when they're like 84,</v>

39
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.930
<v Speaker 1>is that they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They run into all sorts of trouble and </v>

40
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.230
<v Speaker 1>some of it's social and some of it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural,</v>

41
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>some of it's a consequence of their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral inadequacy,</v>

42
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 1>so they're fools and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

43
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that's so interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that despite the fact that they're </v>

44
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.001
<v Speaker 1>fools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still supposed to go on the </v>

45
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:27.591
<v Speaker 1>adventure and that they're capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning enough as a consequence of </v>

46
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:32.271
<v Speaker 1>moving forward on the adventure so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they straightened themselves out across </v>

47
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:32.271
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

48
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>And so it's something like this and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumambulation that young talked about</v>

49
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 1>was this continual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll return to this.</v>

50
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:42.300
<v Speaker 1>This continual circling in some sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you could be.</v>

51
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>You might notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

52
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>that there are themes in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

53
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>when you go back across your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

54
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.920
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have your typical experience</v>

55
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>that sort of repeats itself and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be variation on it,</v>

56
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 1>like a musical theme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

57
00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.390
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're circling yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting closer to yourself as you move </v>

58
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the circumambulation.</v>

59
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Now you remember that for a sec because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go back to it.</v>

60
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine that something glimmers </v>

61
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.631
<v Speaker 1>before you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an an interest that's dawning and </v>

62
00:03:12.631 --> 00:03:12.631
<v Speaker 1>you decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:03:12.631 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're paralyzed.</v>

64
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

65
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>how do I know if I should pursue that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a stupid idea,</v>

66
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>and the proper response to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

67
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.480
<v Speaker 1>It probably is a stupid idea because </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all the all ideas are stupid and </v>

68
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.101
<v Speaker 1>so the probability that as you move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward on your adventure that you're </v>

69
00:03:29.101 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>going to get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time is zero.</v>

70
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>It's just not going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then you might think,</v>

71
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:39.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll just wait around until I get </v>

72
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>the right idea and which people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

73
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>So they're like 40 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 year olds,</v>

74
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:46.981
<v Speaker 1>which is not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they wait around until it's waiting </v>

75
00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 1>for Godot until they finally got it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

76
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is you're too stupid to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know when you've got it right.</v>

77
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:56.251
<v Speaker 1>So waiting around isn't going to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>because even if the perfect opportunity </v>

78
00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>manifested itself to you in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>incomplete form,</v>

79
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you would recognize</v>
<v Speaker 1>it as the perfect opportunity is zero.</v>

80
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.820
<v Speaker 1>You might even think it's the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible idea that you've ever heard of </v>

81
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 1>anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly likely,</v>

82
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>highly likely.</v>

83
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.060
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you ha,</v>

84
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a niche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a niche called that,</v>

85
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:14.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

86
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 1>will to stupidity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I really liked.</v>

87
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.620
<v Speaker 1>So because he thought of stupidity as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

88
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

89
00:04:21.051 --> 00:04:26.051
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take it into account </v>

90
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:26.051
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally and work with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

91
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.500
<v Speaker 1>and so you can take these tentative </v>
<v Speaker 1>steps on your pathway to destiny and you</v>

92
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 1>can assume that you're going to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly.</v>

93
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's really useful because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to beat yourself up.</v>

94
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty easy to do it badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

95
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:42.790
<v Speaker 1>it's way better to do it badly the not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it at all.</v>

96
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's the continual message that </v>
<v Speaker 1>echoes through these historical stories </v>

97
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>in genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like these are flawed people.</v>

98
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>They should have got the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their house way before they did.</v>

99
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go out and they stumble around </v>

100
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>in tyranny and feminine self betrayal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

101
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 1>and violence.</v>

102
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.800
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a hell of a lot better than </v>

103
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.800
<v Speaker 1>just rotting away at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the,</v>

104
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's good and so why is that?</v>

105
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

106
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:15.991
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start your path and you think that </v>

107
00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:18.121
<v Speaker 1>you're heading towards your star and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go in that direction and then </v>

108
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 1>because you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world looks a particular way,</v>

109
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:27.691
<v Speaker 1>but then when you move here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world looks different and you're </v>

110
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:29.530
<v Speaker 1>different as a consequence of having </v>
<v Speaker 1>made that voyage.</v>

111
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:34.531
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that now that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that glimmers in front of you is </v>

112
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:38.611
<v Speaker 1>going to have shifted its location </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you weren't very good at </v>

113
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 1>specifying it to begin with and now that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a little sharper and more focused</v>

114
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:47.281
<v Speaker 1>than you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to reveal itself with more </v>

115
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:49.570
<v Speaker 1>accuracy to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have to take a,</v>

116
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like 180 degree reversal,</v>

117
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.650
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

118
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've gone this far and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long ways to get that far,</v>

119
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.320
<v Speaker 1>but that's a lot farther than you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be if you just stayed where you were </v>

120
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>waiting.</v>

121
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And so it doesn't matter that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>overshoot continually because as you </v>

122
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:20.771
<v Speaker 1>overshoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't learn what you </v>

123
00:06:20.771 --> 00:06:24.431
<v Speaker 1>should've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to continually learn what </v>

124
00:06:24.431 --> 00:06:27.161
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't keep doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you learn enough about what you </v>

125
00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:31.571
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't keep doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's tantamount at some point to </v>

126
00:06:31.571 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 1>learning at the same time what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be doing.</v>

127
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>So it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like this.</v>

128
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Now what's cool about it though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is that as you progress,</v>

129
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 1>the degree of overshooting starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decline,</v>

130
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:50.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that we know that there's nothing </v>

131
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you learn a new skill,</v>

132
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 1>like even to play it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play a song on the piano,</v>

133
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you overshoot madly,</v>

134
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 1>you're making all sorts of mistakes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>

135
00:06:56.601 --> 00:07:01.601
<v Speaker 1>And then the mistakes they disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a great ted talk,</v>

136
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:10.301
<v Speaker 1>I think it was about this guy a up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really advanced computational recording </v>

137
00:07:10.301 --> 00:07:15.221
<v Speaker 1>system in his home and recorded every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single utterance his young child made </v>

138
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 1>while learning to speak.</v>

139
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.120
<v Speaker 1>And then he put together the child's </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts to say certain phonemes and put</v>

140
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 1>them in list and you can hear the child </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviating madly to begin with.</v>

141
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.110
<v Speaker 1>And then after hundreds and hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>repetitions,</v>

142
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:35.111
<v Speaker 1>just zeroing right in on the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>phoneme so you know you might not know </v>

143
00:07:35.541 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when kids babble,</v>

144
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:38.810
<v Speaker 1>because they start babbling when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite young,</v>

145
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.020
<v Speaker 1>they babble every human phoneme </v>
<v Speaker 1>including all sorts of phonemes that </v>

146
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.221
<v Speaker 1>adults can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they they die into their </v>

147
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:50.930
<v Speaker 1>language so that after they learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say English,</v>

148
00:07:50.931 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 1>then there's all sorts of phonemes they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can no longer here or pronounced,</v>

149
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:55.250
<v Speaker 1>but to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all there.</v>

150
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Just really quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so they Z,</v>

151
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.740
<v Speaker 1>as they learn a particular language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they zero in on the proper way to </v>

152
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.090
<v Speaker 1>pronounce that and their errors </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimize.</v>

153
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:07.490
<v Speaker 1>And every time you learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it is.</v>

154
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:12.491
<v Speaker 1>And that's really useful to know too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it means that it's okay to </v>

155
00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 1>wander around stupidly before you fix </v>
<v Speaker 1>your destination.</v>

156
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Now you see that echoed in exodus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

157
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians or the Hebrews escape </v>

158
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 1>materiality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of whatever you do </v>

159
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.410
<v Speaker 1>personally and psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you escape from your previous set </v>

160
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.270
<v Speaker 1>of stupidly held and ignorant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stubborn axioms,</v>

161
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.280
<v Speaker 1>it's like away from that tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

162
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:35.870
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I freed myself from that.</v>

163
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Well then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you think,</v>

164
00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm on the way.</v>

165
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:39.980
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

166
00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Now you're in the desert where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wander around stupidly,</v>

167
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.750
<v Speaker 1>you know and worship the wrong things </v>
<v Speaker 1>until you finally organize yourself </v>

168
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>morally again and head in the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

169
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:53.750
<v Speaker 1>so that's worth knowing too because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

170
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got rid of a lot of things,</v>

171
00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:01.551
<v Speaker 1>baggage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excess baggage that I didn't need in my </v>

172
00:09:01.551 --> 00:09:01.551
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now everything's okay.</v>

173
00:09:01.551 --> 00:09:01.551
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

174
00:09:01.551 --> 00:09:05.871
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got rid of a whole set of </v>

175
00:09:05.871 --> 00:09:06.930
<v Speaker 1>scaffolds that were keeping you in place</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they were pathological.</v>

176
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Now you have nothing and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually turns out to be better than </v>

177
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.161
<v Speaker 1>something pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're still stuck with the problem </v>

178
00:09:16.161 --> 00:09:17.350
<v Speaker 1>of nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's well,</v>

179
00:09:17.351 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly why exodus is structured </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that it is.</v>

180
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 1>It's that you escaped from maturity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hooray.</v>

181
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:24.210
<v Speaker 1>We're no longer slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

182
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 1>well now you're nihilistic and lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily an improvement,</v>

183
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.950
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is the pre.</v>

184
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:36.230
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also useful to know that because </v>

185
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.260
<v Speaker 1>you can also be diluted into the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that imagine that you're trying to </v>

186
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.680
<v Speaker 1>become enlightened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might mean to turn all those parts</v>

187
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 1>of you on that could be turned on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

188
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:44.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a linear pathway uphill.</v>

189
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just from one success to another.</v>

190
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:48.120
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

191
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:53.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like here you are and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing too badly in the first step is a </v>

192
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:53.450
<v Speaker 1>complete bloody catastrophe.</v>

193
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:58.010
<v Speaker 1>It's worse and then maybe you can pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself together and you hit a new </v>

194
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 1>plateau and then that crumbles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shakes and bang.</v>

195
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:05.661
<v Speaker 1>It's worse again and so because part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that people don't become </v>

196
00:10:05.661 --> 00:10:09.621
<v Speaker 1>enlightened is because it's punctuated </v>
<v Speaker 1>by intermittent deserts essentially by </v>

197
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 1>intermittent catastrophes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't know that well,</v>

198
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:18.051
<v Speaker 1>then you're basically screwed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go ahead on your movement forward </v>

199
00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:18.630
<v Speaker 1>and you collapse and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

200
00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 1>that didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I collapsed.</v>

201
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:20.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

202
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.290
<v Speaker 1>that's par for the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not indication that you failed.</v>

203
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:29.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just indication that it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard and that when you learn something,</v>

204
00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:34.131
<v Speaker 1>you also unlearn something and the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>you unlearned is probably useful and </v>

205
00:10:34.131 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 1>unlearning it actually is painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

206
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:37.260
<v Speaker 1>let's say if you have to get out of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad relationship,</v>

207
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.230
<v Speaker 1>it's like not every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not any real.</v>

208
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.930
<v Speaker 1>There isn't any relationship that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent bad,</v>

209
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 1>and so when you jump out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you're in better shape,</v>

210
00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 1>but you're still lonesome and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disoriented and you don't know what your</v>

211
00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 1>past was and you don't know what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>present isn't.</v>

212
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.580
<v Speaker 1>He don't want know what your future is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that's not.</v>

213
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.500
<v Speaker 1>That's why people stay with the devil </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know instead of you know,</v>

214
00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.030
<v Speaker 1>looking for the devil they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

215
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:06.350
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you're full of faults </v>

216
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.600
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you have to stop and thank </v>
<v Speaker 1>God for that.</v>

217
00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:14.601
<v Speaker 1>That's a really useful thing and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that you're full of faults doesn't </v>

218
00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:18.471
<v Speaker 1>mean that you can't learn and so you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>pause it in an ideal and you're going to</v>

219
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:23.631
<v Speaker 1>be wrong about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because what </v>

220
00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:23.850
<v Speaker 1>you're right about his positing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideal moving towards it,</v>

221
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.240
<v Speaker 1>if the actual ideal is conceptualized </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly well first surprise,</v>

222
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.190
<v Speaker 1>surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like what are you going to do?</v>

223
00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:37.191
<v Speaker 1>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter that it's </v>

224
00:11:37.191 --> 00:11:37.191
<v Speaker 1>imperfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imperfect,</v>

225
00:11:37.191 --> 00:11:38.910
<v Speaker 1>it just matters that you do it and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you move forward.</v>

226
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really positive news as far as </v>

227
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned because you could actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>

228
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it badly.</v>

229
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Anyone can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

230
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.920
<v Speaker 1>that's useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

231
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:53.910
<v Speaker 1>So like if you were an efficient person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have just done that but you're</v>

232
00:11:53.911 --> 00:11:55.350
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But who cares,</v>

233
00:11:55.351 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you still end up in the,</v>

234
00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.660
<v Speaker 1>in the same place and maybe the trip is </v>
<v Speaker 1>even more interesting.</v>

235
00:12:00.661 --> 00:12:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably too interesting.</v>
