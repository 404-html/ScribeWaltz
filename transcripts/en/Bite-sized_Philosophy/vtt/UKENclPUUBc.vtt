1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Consider the lilies of the field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they grow.</v>

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.800
<v Speaker 1>They toil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Neither do they spin,</v>

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.250
<v Speaker 1>and yet I say unto you that even Solomon</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all his glory was not arrayed like </v>

4
00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:13.280
<v Speaker 1>one of these.</v>

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Wherefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if God so clothes the grass of the </v>

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which today is and tomorrow is cast into</v>

7
00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:23.050
<v Speaker 1>the oven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shall he not much more clothe you,</v>

8
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.290
<v Speaker 1>oh ye of little faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore take no thought saying,</v>

9
00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>what shall we eat or what shall we drink</v>
<v Speaker 1>or wherewithal shall we be closed.</v>

10
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Those are famous lines and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ the Hippie,</v>

11
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

12
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it all hang out.</v>

13
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>That's an old phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do your thing and everything will come </v>

14
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.441
<v Speaker 1>to you and these lines have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreted in that manner many times,</v>

15
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>but that's seriously not the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation because there's a kicker </v>

16
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 1>with this injunction and the kicker is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>for your heavenly father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that you have need of all these </v>

18
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.480
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but seek ye first the Kingdom of God and</v>

19
00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:12.940
<v Speaker 1>his righteousness and all these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>shall be added unto you.</v>

20
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot different than the hippie </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

21
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a very,</v>

22
00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:19.870
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting idea here.</v>

23
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:24.871
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly one of the most profound </v>

24
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:26.680
<v Speaker 1>ideas that I've ever encountered and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea is this,</v>

25
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>is that if you configure your life so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what you are genuinely doing is </v>

26
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>aiming at the highest possible good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the things that you need to</v>

27
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>to survive and to thrive on a day to day</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis will deliver themselves to you.</v>

28
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a hypothesis and it's not some </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple hypothesis,</v>

29
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what it basically says is if you</v>

30
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>dare to do the most difficult thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can conceptualize,</v>

31
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>your life will work out better than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

32
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 1>If you do anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to find out if that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>true?</v>

34
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a Kierkegaardian leap of faith.</v>

35
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>There is no way you're going to find out</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not that's true unless you do</v>

36
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:08.990
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

37
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>no one can tell you either because just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it works for someone else.</v>

38
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting and all that,</v>

39
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's no proof that it'll work for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

40
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:22.701
<v Speaker 1>You have to be all in in this game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is seek ye first the </v>

41
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Kingdom of God and his righteousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's actually a fairly </v>

42
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.551
<v Speaker 1>important caution when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about not having to pay attention to </v>

43
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:37.101
<v Speaker 1>what you're going to eat or what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to where it's like what it's </v>

44
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:40.701
<v Speaker 1>essentially saying is that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems are trivial in comparison and </v>

45
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>the probability is that if you manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself properly in the world,</v>

46
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>that those things will come your way is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily high.</v>

47
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>And I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that that's exactly right.</v>

48
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

49
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched people operate in the world</v>

50
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.950
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that there is no more </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective way of operating the world </v>

51
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.560
<v Speaker 1>than to conceptualize the highest good </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can and then strive to attain </v>

52
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:09.631
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no more practical pathway to the</v>

53
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>kind of success that you could have if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually knew what success was.</v>

54
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.750
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what this sermon is attempting </v>

55
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.750
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

56
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.140
<v Speaker 1>to posit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like in,</v>

57
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>in the story of Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what happens at the beginning </v>

58
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.040
<v Speaker 1>of the story of Pinocchio is that Japan </v>
<v Speaker 1>wishes on a star.</v>

59
00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:37.041
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that a little bit and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you pedal does is align himself </v>

60
00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:41.211
<v Speaker 1>with the metaphorical manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest good he can conceptualize </v>

61
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.580
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says he makes sure he makes a </v>

62
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.790
<v Speaker 1>commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say he aims at the star and for </v>

63
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.890
<v Speaker 1>him the star is the possibility that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take his creation,</v>

64
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.100
<v Speaker 1>a puppet whose strings are being pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>by unseen forces and have it transform </v>

65
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:01.980
<v Speaker 1>into something that's our economists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

66
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

67
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>well that's a hell of an ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when we're wise enough to put </v>

68
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.801
<v Speaker 1>that into children's movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but too foolish to understand what it </v>

69
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.671
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such an interesting juxtaposition </v>

70
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:15.950
<v Speaker 1>that that we can both know that and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it.</v>

71
00:04:15.951 --> 00:04:17.960
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to the movie,</v>

72
00:04:17.961 --> 00:04:22.961
<v Speaker 1>you can watch it and it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that you can go </v>

73
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:22.961
<v Speaker 1>home and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

74
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:24.680
<v Speaker 1>I know what that meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While people are complicated,</v>

75
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We exist at different levels and all the</v>

76
00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:28.070
<v Speaker 1>levels don't communicate with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

77
00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:33.071
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the movie is a hypothesis and the </v>

78
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:36.791
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis is there's no better pathway </v>
<v Speaker 1>to self realization and the enablement </v>

79
00:04:37.821 --> 00:04:42.821
<v Speaker 1>of being than to pause it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest good that you can conceive </v>

80
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:45.830
<v Speaker 1>of and commit yourself to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might also ask yourself,</v>

81
00:04:45.831 --> 00:04:49.640
<v Speaker 1>and this is definitely worth asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is do you really have anything better to</v>

82
00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:51.410
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't,</v>

83
00:04:51.411 --> 00:04:56.411
<v Speaker 1>well why would you do anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore take no thought for the </v>

84
00:04:57.151 --> 00:05:02.151
<v Speaker 1>morrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the morrow shall take thought for </v>

85
00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:02.151
<v Speaker 1>the things of itself sufficient unto the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day is the evil thereof.</v>

86
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I spent a long time trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that meant to because it's another </v>

87
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.480
<v Speaker 1>one of those lines that</v>

88
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.460
<v Speaker 1>can easily be read as pro grasshopper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an anti amped.</v>

89
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.380
<v Speaker 1>You know you remember the old fable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the grasshopper in the end,</v>

90
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to tell it,</v>

91
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.290
<v Speaker 1>but works and the grasshopper fiddles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ad has a pretty good time in the</v>

92
00:05:27.121 --> 00:05:32.121
<v Speaker 1>winter and the grasshopper dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is like a pro grasshopper </v>

93
00:05:32.121 --> 00:05:36.081
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not because it says something </v>

94
00:05:36.081 --> 00:05:38.331
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says that if you orient yourself </v>

95
00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:38.331
<v Speaker 1>properly</v>

96
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 1>and then pay attention to what you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day that works,</v>

97
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.270
<v Speaker 1>and I actually think that that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>accordance with what with what we have </v>

98
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.751
<v Speaker 1>come to understand about human </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception because what happens is that </v>

99
00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>the world shifts itself around your aim </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're.</v>

100
00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>You're a creature that has an aim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have an ame in order to do </v>

101
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in aiming creature.</v>

102
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 1>You look at a point and you move towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

103
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>It's built right into you and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a name.</v>

104
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:11.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say your aim is the highest </v>

105
00:06:11.531 --> 00:06:12.941
<v Speaker 1>possible ame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then so that sets up the world </v>

106
00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:12.941
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

107
00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 1>it organizes all of your perceptions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizes what you see and you don't </v>

108
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.491
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It organizes your emotions and your </v>

109
00:06:21.491 --> 00:06:21.680
<v Speaker 1>motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you organize yourself around that aim</v>

110
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:26.681
<v Speaker 1>and then what happens is the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself as a set of challenges </v>

111
00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>and problems and if you solve them </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

112
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.210
<v Speaker 1>then you stay on the pathway towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>that eighth and you can concentrate on </v>

113
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.210
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

114
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.650
<v Speaker 1>on the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that way you get to have your </v>

115
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.650
<v Speaker 1>cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And eat it too because you can,</v>

116
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 1>you can point into the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the far distance and you can live in the</v>

117
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 1>day</v>

118
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.950
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes every moment of the day </v>

119
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.551
<v Speaker 1>supercharged with meaning that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if everything that you're doing </v>

120
00:06:53.551 --> 00:06:56.860
<v Speaker 1>everyday is related to the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible aim that you can conceptualize,</v>

121
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the very definition of the </v>

122
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.070
<v Speaker 1>meaning that would sustain you in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life well,</v>

123
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.210
<v Speaker 1>and then the issue is well back to noah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well all hell is about to break loose </v>

124
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.081
<v Speaker 1>and chaos is coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when that's happening in your </v>

125
00:07:10.081 --> 00:07:12.301
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might want to be doing something </v>

126
00:07:12.301 --> 00:07:14.140
<v Speaker 1>that you regard as truly worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what will keep you afloat</v>

127
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.400
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when everything is flooded and you don't</v>

128
00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:22.210
<v Speaker 1>want to wait until the flood comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start doing that.</v>

129
00:07:22.211 --> 00:07:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're arcs half built and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how to captain it,</v>

130
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.780
<v Speaker 1>the probability is very high that</v>

131
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.940
<v Speaker 2>that you'll drown.</v>
