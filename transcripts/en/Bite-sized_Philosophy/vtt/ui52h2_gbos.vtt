00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I could talk.</v>

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Let me talk about the situation at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivy League universities.</v>

3
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question broadly speaking covers the</v>

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>question about intelligence and about </v>
<v Speaker 1>its diverse manifestations and about its</v>

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.250
<v Speaker 1>role in selection for universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could go back and look at the records at</v>

6
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Harvard for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the early 19 sixties,</v>

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.700
<v Speaker 1>the typical IQ for a Harvard student was</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 100,</v>

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>five to 110,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not much above average,</v>

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.040
<v Speaker 1>but that's because they were finishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools for the,</v>

10
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>for the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

11
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>and you know your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had a rich father and he made his</v>

12
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:38.451
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was probably well above average in </v>

13
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you are his offspring,</v>

14
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.750
<v Speaker 1>there's regression towards the mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no reason to assume that by </v>

15
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>nature of your position you are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be particularly intelligent anyways.</v>

16
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>The average Ivy League student wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was bright but not outstanding.</v>

17
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>So now it's 100 IQ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>145,</v>

18
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>three standard deviations above the mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

19
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're selected by the sat scholastic </v>

20
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>aptitude test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an IQ test.</v>

21
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 1>They won't say it's an IQ test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't matter.</v>

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an IQ test.</v>

23
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any any test that contains a </v>

24
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:19.461
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently diverse range of problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>solving questions that's rank ordered </v>

25
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

26
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>in accuracy among people is an IQ test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correlations like point eight,</v>

27
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and what has happened.</v>

28
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>There's two things that have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Ivy Leagues have got more and</v>

29
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 1>more selective because they can and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>the average IQ of their students is just</v>

30
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>continued to move upwards and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>average IQ of the population is actually</v>

31
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 1>increased to a substantive degree to </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last 50 years.</v>

32
00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:47.871
<v Speaker 1>Partly because partly perhaps mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of improved nutrition and and </v>

33
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>information exposure along among the.</v>

34
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Like the more deprived members of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

35
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>It's better to watch tv than to sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone in your crib for example,</v>

36
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>an isolated and people have enough food </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

37
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>So the really low end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence spectrum is being truncated</v>

38
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>and the general population IQ is </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased.</v>

39
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>So with regards to institutions like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto,</v>

40
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>say they average IQ at the University of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto with somewhere between 120 130,</v>

41
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.360
<v Speaker 1>and we know that because we've tested it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not surprising because you're </v>

42
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>basically selected for cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

43
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because grades are rough.</v>

44
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Marker of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness,</v>

45
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>by the way also matters independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>trait because the best two predictors of</v>

46
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>university grades are conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and intelligence,</v>

47
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 1>not creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

48
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>zero correlation with creativity.</v>
