00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.330
<v Speaker 1>So here's a cool psychological study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's called the marshmallow test and </v>

2
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:11.271
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's even a reliable study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it was done by social </v>

3
00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:14.961
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably replicable and it's a nice</v>

4
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take small children and you bring</v>

5
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>them into a room and you put something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would like in front of them,</v>

6
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>a marshmallow and you then you torture </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Basically you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that marshmallow in the kid thinks,</v>

8
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that marshmallow.</v>

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can have that marshmallow </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now or if you wait,</v>

10
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I think the experiment is 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can have two marshmallows.</v>

11
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>And so that puts the child in quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conundrum because they're being asked to</v>

12
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:53.151
<v Speaker 1>trade in actual concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tangible marshmallow for two </v>

13
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:57.651
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical future marshmallows and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to conjure up a </v>

14
00:00:57.751 --> 00:01:02.751
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical future reality that has the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same tangible significance as something </v>

15
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>real right in front of you.</v>

16
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>And so it's amazing thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do that.</v>

17
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>And so then the experimenter leaves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some children's grabbed the marshmallow </v>

18
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>and just chomp that thing down right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

19
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Other kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they videotaped kids while they're </v>

20
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>waiting and they do all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They whistled,</v>

21
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>they look at the ceiling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sit on their hands,</v>

22
00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:25.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried to distract themselves.</v>

23
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:30.921
<v Speaker 1>Course they're eyeing that marshmallow </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a squirrel lying and not and and </v>

24
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:35.691
<v Speaker 1>trying to restrain themselves and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what I see in that is that the </v>

25
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>child's prefrontal Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the higher cortical systems are warring </v>

26
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>with the underlying motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

27
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>more primordial motivational systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that govern such things as hunger.</v>

28
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>The hunger system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamic system says there's </v>

29
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>something sweet and fat right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sitting there,</v>

30
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 1>right bloody now grab that thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff it down now,</v>

31
00:01:56.551 --> 00:02:01.551
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure many of you have a constant</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle with your hypothalamus with </v>

32
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:05.631
<v Speaker 1>regards to sweet and fat things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>often lose so you can feel some sympathy</v>

33
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:11.751
<v Speaker 1>for the child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the hypothalamus has these </v>

34
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>tremendously powerful tendrils upward </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the brain,</v>

35
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>into the parts that we would associate </v>
<v Speaker 1>more with voluntary control and the </v>

36
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.571
<v Speaker 1>voluntary control centers have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>little weak ribbons going down to </v>

37
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>control the hypothalamus.</v>

38
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Since it's pretty obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know something about </v>

39
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>neuroanatomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what part is actually in charge when the</v>

40
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:35.391
<v Speaker 1>chips are down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not easy for children to learn </v>

41
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>to regulate those underlying primordial </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses,</v>

42
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are wired in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that we share with animals,</v>

43
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>but they do it and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the cool thing is,</v>

44
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>this is what Walter Michelle found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy who did the study,</v>

45
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:51.951
<v Speaker 1>was that the longterm outcome for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>children who can delay gratification in </v>

46
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:57.381
<v Speaker 1>the marshmallow test is much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive than it is for the children </v>

47
00:02:57.381 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>that are impulsive and eat the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marshmallow instantly.</v>

48
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>It's delay of gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's likely that that's associated </v>

49
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.031
<v Speaker 1>with trait conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although that specifically has that </v>

50
00:03:09.031 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>specific connection has not yet been </v>
<v Speaker 1>established,</v>

51
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>but they seem conceptually very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>

52
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

53
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>this emerges in children probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the ages of two and four,</v>

54
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

55
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.640
<v Speaker 1>They should have it in place by four </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's very difficult for them to </v>

56
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.081
<v Speaker 1>really interact well with other children</v>
<v Speaker 1>without having that delay of </v>

57
00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:37.171
<v Speaker 1>gratification in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you can't delay </v>

58
00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:39.661
<v Speaker 1>gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other kids don't like you because </v>

59
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:42.120
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want everything your way and you </v>

60
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.371
<v Speaker 1>want it now and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're liable to temper tantrums and </v>

61
00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:44.371
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't got the kind of self control</v>

62
00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>necessary to make you fun to play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can see that emerging in children</v>

63
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:53.821
<v Speaker 1>and it's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty interesting and not only </v>

64
00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:53.821
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it emerges,</v>

65
00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:57.661
<v Speaker 1>it predicts positive longterm outcomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like trait conscientiousness does </v>

66
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.940
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because trait conscientiousness is the </v>

67
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.890
<v Speaker 1>second best predictor of longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>success over the lifespan.</v>

68
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>In Western cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's second after intelligence and so in</v>

69
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:12.931
<v Speaker 1>our societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who do best across time are </v>

70
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:16.241
<v Speaker 1>the people who have high Iq is and who </v>
<v Speaker 1>work hard and I would say that's a </v>

71
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:18.070
<v Speaker 1>pretty decent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

72
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a validation in some sense that our</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures are working properly because </v>

73
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.751
<v Speaker 1>what you would want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say if the system is working </v>

74
00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:31.831
<v Speaker 1>meritocratic Lee like it should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're trying to extract </v>

75
00:04:31.831 --> 00:04:36.090
<v Speaker 1>resources from those who can contribute </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a higher rate than what you would </v>

76
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>want to have happen is that the hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>working smart people do better.</v>

77
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>

78
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>then everyone does better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>
