00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something my wife has pointed </v>

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:05.290
<v Speaker 1>out to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.601
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men are going to have to stand up for </v>

4
00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:08.601
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the problem.</v>

5
00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I know how to stand up to a man who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

6
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfairly trespassing against me.</v>

7
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:18.771
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I know that is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the parameters for my resistance are </v>

8
00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>quite well defined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is we talk,</v>

9
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>we argue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we push,</v>

10
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 1>and then it becomes physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:29.601
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we move beyond the boundaries of </v>

12
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 1>civil discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know what the next step is,</v>

13
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.600
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's forbidden in,</v>

14
00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:36.601
<v Speaker 1>in discourse with women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't think that men can </v>

15
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>control crazy women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

16
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>I really don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they have to throw their </v>

17
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>hands up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

18
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in what,</v>

19
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.770
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

20
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not even disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that the cultural,</v>

21
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.100
<v Speaker 1>there's no step forward that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take under those circumstances because </v>

22
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>if the man is offensive enough and crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

23
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>the reaction becomes physical right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

24
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Or at least the threat is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when men are talking to each other </v>

25
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>in any serious manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that underlying thread of physicality is</v>

26
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>always there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if it's a real conversation </v>

27
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>and it keeps the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Civil Law is to some degree,</v>

28
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking to a man who wouldn't </v>

29
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>fight with you under any circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

30
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 1>then you're talking to someone to whom </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have absolutely no respect,</v>

31
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>but I can't see any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

32
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a woman in in Toronto who's been</v>

33
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 1>organizing this movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say against me and some other </v>

34
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.941
<v Speaker 1>people who are going to do a free speech</v>
<v Speaker 1>event and she managed to organize quite </v>

35
00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>effectively and she's quite offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say.</v>

36
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>She compared us to Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

37
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.010
<v Speaker 1>publicly using the swastika,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't really something I was all </v>

39
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>that fond of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

40
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:48.441
<v Speaker 1>I'm defenseless against that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>female insanity because the techniques </v>

41
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>that I would use against a man who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>employing those tactics are forbidden to</v>

42
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

43
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.460
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it seems to me that it isn't man </v>

44
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.251
<v Speaker 1>that have to stand up and say enough of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this even though that is what they </v>

45
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:04.941
<v Speaker 1>should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that it's same women who </v>

46
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>have to stand up against their crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>sisters and say,</v>

47
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:10.731
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough of that enough man hating enough </v>

48
00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough bringing disgrace on us as a,</v>

49
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>as a gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem there and then they'll </v>

50
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.991
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My little tirade is that most of the </v>

51
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>women I know who are saying are busy </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing saying things right.</v>

52
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 1>They're off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have their career,</v>

53
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:28.701
<v Speaker 1>they have their family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're quite occupied and they don't </v>

54
00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:30.951
<v Speaker 1>seem to have the time or maybe even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest to go after their crazy </v>

55
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>heartbeat sisters and so I don't see any</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulating force for that.</v>

56
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.410
<v Speaker 1>That terrible femininity and it seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to be invading the culture and </v>

57
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>undermining the masculine power of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture in a way that's,</v>

58
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I think fatal.</v>
