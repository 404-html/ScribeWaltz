1
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
<v Speaker 1>The chaos is hiding in what's irrelevant</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's very interesting observation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because since the chaos is virtually </v>

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.441
<v Speaker 1>infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real question is where the hell </v>

4
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:14.620
<v Speaker 1>do you put it while you put it in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you ignore and you can ignore it as long</v>

5
00:00:14.621 --> 00:00:17.380
<v Speaker 1>as it isn't actively interfering with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your movement forward,</v>

6
00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:22.381
<v Speaker 1>you can assume that it's that it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter that it doesn't matter that it </v>

7
00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:24.500
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

8
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the kicker.</v>

9
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:32.751
<v Speaker 1>There's one more class of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can run into along the way and this </v>

10
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>is where the chaos breaks through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say</v>

11
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>you're moving from point a to point b </v>
<v Speaker 1>and something that you don't expect </v>

12
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>occurs and it gets in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that you're living with </v>

13
00:00:54.431 --> 00:00:55.900
<v Speaker 1>someone and maybe you kind of liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

14
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>You're not married so you don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>them that much because otherwise you'd </v>

15
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.180
<v Speaker 1>ask them to marry you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

16
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so ha,</v>

17
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>quarter of youth as looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something better and three quarters view</v>

18
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.310
<v Speaker 1>is half satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

19
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.960
<v Speaker 1>And then a person because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambivalent about such things.</v>

20
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:18.961
<v Speaker 1>And then the person you discover or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person announces that they've been </v>

21
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>having an affair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:22.840
<v Speaker 1>So then how are you supposed to respond </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally to that?</v>

23
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part of you that wasn't all that </v>

24
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>committed to the relationship is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhilarated by that.</v>

25
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.820
<v Speaker 1>And then the three quarters of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's half satisfied is hurt and,</v>

26
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to exploit that part </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure in the ensuing discussions and </v>

27
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>not mention the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

28
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.440
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of exciting that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>betrayed me that way.</v>

29
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

30
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.480
<v Speaker 1>but the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you,</v>

31
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what's happened is a whole has you </v>

32
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.381
<v Speaker 1>have this structure that you're walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>on ice thin ice that you're skating on </v>

33
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:55.270
<v Speaker 1>and now there's a hole in it and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>

34
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.450
<v Speaker 1>we don't even know how deep the hole is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know there's a hole there and so</v>

35
00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:03.451
<v Speaker 1>now you're anxious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll maybe also a little bit excited </v>

36
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 1>because God only knows what's down there</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

37
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.950
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know what to do with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole because it could spread very badly</v>

38
00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:13.951
<v Speaker 1>on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be that you know the whole </v>

39
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:16.231
<v Speaker 1>relationship was a facade and that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your relationships have been facades,</v>

40
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>facades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the reason that is is because </v>

41
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.671
<v Speaker 1>you're so damn shallow that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible for you to have a </v>

42
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:26.011
<v Speaker 1>relationship that isn't just a facade </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly because you don't pay </v>

43
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:30.061
<v Speaker 1>any attention to other people and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>also partly because you're malevolent </v>

44
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:32.851
<v Speaker 1>and selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a nasty thing to discover or </v>

45
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:33.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's the sort of person that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're attracting,</v>

46
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:38.731
<v Speaker 1>which would make sense actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the sort of person that you </v>

47
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:40.210
<v Speaker 1>are and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are certain things that you can</v>

48
00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:45.211
<v Speaker 1>encounter that basically unglue you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what happens is that those moments </v>

49
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:48.940
<v Speaker 1>of being unglued travel up that entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of presuppositions.</v>

50
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like because the one of the logical</v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusions to being betrayed in a </v>

51
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.860
<v Speaker 1>relationship is that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're truly a bad person.</v>

52
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Now another equally logical conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the person that you're with is </v>

53
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:08.311
<v Speaker 1>really a bad person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another logical conclusion is all </v>

54
00:03:08.311 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>people are truly bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

55
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

56
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.800
<v Speaker 1>in macro ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

57
00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>in microwaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't trust anyone.</v>

58
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>You can't trust women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't trust men.</v>

59
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>You can't trust human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't trust yourself.</v>

60
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>The whole place is a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a nightmare.</v>

61
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can fall through into chaos.</v>

62
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Now the way your body responds to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you know you're supposed to be </v>

63
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>getting a promotion at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

64
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:35.821
<v Speaker 1>You're all chipper about the promotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>at work and you walk into your boss's </v>

65
00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>office because he or she wants to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and they say,</v>

66
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:45.061
<v Speaker 1>we've reviewed your performance over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last few years and your performance has </v>

68
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:51.361
<v Speaker 1>been somewhere between mediocre and </v>
<v Speaker 1>decent and we're downsizing and see you </v>

69
00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:53.090
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

70
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 1>That's not a raise or a promotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

71
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole that you fall into and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

72
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of that?</v>

73
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you frame that?</v>

74
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>How do you take that emergent chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make habitable order out of?</v>

75
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the whole capitalist system rotten to</v>

76
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>the core?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

77
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>that's a convenient explanation under </v>
<v Speaker 1>those circumstances.</v>

78
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:21.841
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where you're working for a psychopathic </v>

79
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:24.541
<v Speaker 1>son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you make the wrong choice in </v>

80
00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:27.721
<v Speaker 1>university and was that your father's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fault because you never did what you </v>

81
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:30.901
<v Speaker 1>wanted or was it your fault for not </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up to them or is it a dying </v>

82
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:34.980
<v Speaker 1>industry or is maybe there's a wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>call that you should go do something </v>

83
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.921
<v Speaker 1>else that you've been waiting to do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that you've actually wanted to do </v>

84
00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:41.341
<v Speaker 1>your whole life and that's why you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing such a miserable job at your </v>

85
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:44.791
<v Speaker 1>current occupation because you're bitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and resentful about the fact that you </v>

86
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:44.791
<v Speaker 1>never did what you want.</v>

87
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:49.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all of those things at once and </v>

88
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.381
<v Speaker 1>that's very stressful because all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things at once is too many things </v>

89
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 1>and that's the reemergence of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the flood.</v>

90
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the return to the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cosmos.</v>

91
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 1>That's another way that it's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented.</v>

92
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:05.491
<v Speaker 1>Mythologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the you voyage all the way back to </v>

93
00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:08.341
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of the cosmos when there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but undifferentiated chaos and </v>

94
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're confronting and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too much for you and often it is.</v>

95
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:17.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean that that can really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can be traumatizing and it can hurt</v>

96
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:22.261
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's just too much for you to </v>

97
00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:22.261
<v Speaker 1>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

98
00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so how do you respond to that?</v>

99
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it is catastrophic negative </v>

100
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.321
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You freeze and that's protective and </v>

101
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't even want to move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to bloody well get out of</v>

102
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 1>bed for a week and that's because your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body is reacting as if the bedroom floor</v>

103
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 1>is covered with snakes and the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing for you to do is just not move.</v>

104
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Just freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a pleasant situation to be in </v>

105
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.580
<v Speaker 1>because it's your hyperaroused very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very physiologically demanding and </v>

106
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 1>there's zero about it that's productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>except maybe the snakes won't see you,</v>

107
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.010
<v Speaker 1>but they've already seen you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that isn't helping very well.</v>

108
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>So you've got all this undifferentiated </v>
<v Speaker 1>native,</v>

109
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>

110
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 1>hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>

111
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 1>guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shame,</v>

112
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:03.320
<v Speaker 1>emotional pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole plethora of catastrophes.</v>

113
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe on the other side lurking</v>
<v Speaker 1>down there is,</v>

114
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.060
<v Speaker 1>thank God I'm done with that job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just bloody well hated.</v>

115
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I dragged myself off to work every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a little part of my soul </v>

116
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.931
<v Speaker 1>that so goddamn happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finally got fired that I can hardly </v>

117
00:06:19.931 --> 00:06:19.931
<v Speaker 1>stand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

118
00:06:19.931 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you don't even admit that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself because,</v>

119
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would mean that all that time you </v>

120
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 1>spent at the job was just sunk costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're diluting yourself the whole time.</v>

121
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is an interesting thing to consider </v>

122
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.201
<v Speaker 1>those sometimes if you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant circumstance of having to </v>

123
00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>fire someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 1>sometimes firing someone is the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that can happen to them,</v>

125
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't mean that you should go </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and like enjoy it.</v>

126
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Although I have met very disagreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who actually enjoyed firing </v>

127
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.220
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

128
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.690
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you a story about that at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some point because it's quite </v>

129
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:52.690
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

130
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.890
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if someone's just limping </v>
<v Speaker 1>along in their job and doing it as </v>

131
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>miserably in wretchedly as they possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>can imagine,</v>

132
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 1>the best thing you can do to them for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them is to say,</v>

133
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're failing at this.</v>

134
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.570
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't necessarily mean that </v>

135
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 1>you would have to be failing at </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely everything else in the entire</v>

136
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:16.331
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you should just accept the dam </v>

137
00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:16.331
<v Speaker 1>failure and go off and try something </v>
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>

138
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.450
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's terrifying for people and I know </v>

139
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:21.450
<v Speaker 1>they hate it and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

140
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.530
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's better than the </v>

141
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.530
<v Speaker 1>alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just slow,</v>

142
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.290
<v Speaker 1>torturous death.</v>
