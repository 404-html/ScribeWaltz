1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.020
<v Speaker 1>And then behind those two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the shadow and the anima and the </v>

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Animus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a final archetype,</v>

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:09.480
<v Speaker 1>which is the archetype of the self and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's young,</v>

4
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:14.481
<v Speaker 1>believed that the self was what you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a totality and that's a hard thing to</v>

5
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:15.880
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 1>but you could think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could think about the self as the,</v>

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.820
<v Speaker 1>as the total of what you are now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus the total of all those things that </v>

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.741
<v Speaker 1>you could still be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would be you as a reality plus us </v>

9
00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a strange idea,</v>

10
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:37.821
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we don't really know how to </v>

11
00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:40.011
<v Speaker 1>understand the idea of potential as </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern empirical people because </v>

12
00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>potential virtually by definition is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet manifest.</v>

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.310
<v Speaker 1>And also not a straightforward thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>either measure or conceptualized.</v>

14
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>By the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody acts as if they're,</v>

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>they have potential unrealized </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

16
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.210
<v Speaker 1>And so young generated up a category to </v>
<v Speaker 1>account for that which he felt was </v>

17
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>expressed in all sorts of symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

18
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wise old man,</v>

19
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:16.641
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the wizards in the movies that all </v>

20
00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>of you have seen in the last five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always the same wizard.</v>

21
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:23.271
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's even the same actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's an archetype of the </v>

22
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:27.111
<v Speaker 1>wise old man and for young Christ was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype of the self as well and I.</v>

23
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.860
<v Speaker 1>I told you why that was to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly because the phoenix is </v>

24
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.571
<v Speaker 1>also an archetype of the self because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Phoenix is something that can die </v>

25
00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:41.931
<v Speaker 1>and be reborn and so the Phoenix stands </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the part of your personality that </v>

26
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:45.921
<v Speaker 1>can let one thing go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One part of you which is in the live </v>

27
00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:49.701
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can let that go and burn up so to speak </v>

28
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:52.881
<v Speaker 1>so that something new can be born </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you very seldom gain something </v>

29
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.490
<v Speaker 1>before you let something else go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's partly because what you </v>

30
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.721
<v Speaker 1>already assume can be the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>impediment that you have to to learning </v>

31
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.620
<v Speaker 1>something new.</v>

32
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's complicated because sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you know worked in the past,</v>

33
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can think about that.</v>

34
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're a perfectly well adapted 11</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old and you're still acting that </v>

35
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.860
<v Speaker 1>way when you're 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

36
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:21.861
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to let that go because it </v>

37
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:21.861
<v Speaker 1>worked and you put a lot of effort into </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

38
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.290
<v Speaker 1>but unless you let it go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new personality isn't going to be </v>

39
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>able to manifest itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to stop being a child before</v>

40
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>you can be an adult and there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice that goes along with that.</v>

41
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>It's also a sacrifice that parents have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make,</v>

42
00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:39.891
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in order for a parent to </v>

43
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>encourage you to adopt the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities of an individual,</v>

44
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 1>they have to allow you as a child to </v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

45
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 1>And Freud's observation on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena was that many parents and he </v>

46
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:59.271
<v Speaker 1>believed this was particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of mothers because of </v>

47
00:02:59.271 --> 00:03:02.691
<v Speaker 1>their tight bond with their children and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dependency that that implies that it</v>

48
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:09.991
<v Speaker 1>was particularly difficult for a mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>to let her child die so that an adult </v>

49
00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>could manifest itself in that child's </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

50
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's fundamentally in many ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>the EDA pool complex.</v>

51
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now I'm going to show you some of </v>

52
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.891
<v Speaker 1>these things again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the thing about young is that </v>

53
00:03:25.891 --> 00:03:30.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to understand what he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say and it's not a simple thing to </v>

54
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his books are complicated,</v>

55
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>although I don't think there are any </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complicated than they have to be.</v>

56
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think young is obscure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just difficult and then </v>

57
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>beyond difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's actually frightening.</v>

58
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of reasons that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like you.</v>
