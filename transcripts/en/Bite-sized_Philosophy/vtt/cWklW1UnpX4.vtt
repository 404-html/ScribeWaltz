1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.300
<v Speaker 1>That's actually why people get married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.230
<v Speaker 1>just so you know,</v>

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.780
<v Speaker 1>because this is built into marital vows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not leaving ever no matter what.</v>

4
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.520
<v Speaker 1>well that definitely puts a boundary </v>
<v Speaker 1>around our arguments,</v>

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I can't say every time you </v>

7
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.921
<v Speaker 1>manifest one of your flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you're likely to do just as often </v>

8
00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:24.440
<v Speaker 1>as me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well enough for this.</v>

9
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's horrible,</v>

10
00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:30.731
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your whole life is while every time </v>

11
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:30.731
<v Speaker 1>you get out of line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of here.</v>

12
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:31.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell are you?</v>

13
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to admit to ever doing </v>

14
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>

15
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.180
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be on your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

16
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:39.470
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a scared cat.</v>

17
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker 1>The entire relationship because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

18
00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:43.730
<v Speaker 1>It could just come to an end at any </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

21
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.950
<v Speaker 1>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the possibility of divorce is open,</v>

22
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>it makes you free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

23
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:51.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you want.</v>

24
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to be free?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A really,</v>

25
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.240
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't predict anything.</v>

26
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.930
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a vow and it says,</v>

27
00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:04.931
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you're trouble me too,</v>

28
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>so we won't leave no matter what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

29
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a vowel,</v>

30
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:16.331
<v Speaker 1>but that's why it's about right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you take it in front of a </v>

31
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:18.761
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's supposed to be a sacred </v>

32
00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:18.761
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

33
00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:19.580
<v Speaker 1>what's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the alternative?</v>

34
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Everything is mutable and changeable at </v>
<v Speaker 1>any moment.</v>

35
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

36
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>You liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your liver,</v>

37
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.900
<v Speaker 1>your life like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see what you're like when you're 50 </v>

38
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dismal.</v>

39
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Two or three divorces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your family's fragmented.</v>

40
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.850
<v Speaker 1>You've got no continuity of narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

41
00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:36.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by any stretch of the imagination,</v>

42
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.140
<v Speaker 1>and so it's a form of voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 1>enslavement I suppose,</v>

43
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:47.141
<v Speaker 1>but it's also equivalent to the adoption</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a responsibility and there's more to </v>

44
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Speaker 1>it than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't run away,</v>

45
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:50.000
<v Speaker 1>then you can solve your problems because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be,</v>

46
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm stuck with you.</v>

47
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>So how about we fix things</v>

48
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.800
<v Speaker 1>because the alternative is we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in a boxing match for the next 40 </v>

49
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the alternative.</v>

50
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think you're going to fix </v>

51
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 1>problems without something like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging over your head.</v>

52
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll just avoid them because that's </v>

53
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to,</v>

54
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>to solve problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in relationship.</v>

55
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>We're having a fight and I find out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're.</v>

56
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>You were abused by your uncle when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were five or some God damn thing.</v>

57
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

58
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>it's very frequent that that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing happens.</v>

59
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the partner,</v>

60
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>your partner is manifesting some weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalous behavior.</v>

61
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 1>You just can't make heads or tails of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

62
00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem related to what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing at all.</v>

63
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as soon as you bring it up,</v>

64
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>they get mad and then you bring it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

65
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.600
<v Speaker 1>They even get mad or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they tell you that you're not going </v>

66
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.600
<v Speaker 1>to talk about that or they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>

67
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really persistent because you're kind of</v>

68
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>a son of a bitch and then they break </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and cry,</v>

69
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.950
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they have this horrible memory </v>

70
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 1>that comes flooding forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's completely.</v>

71
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to sort it out.</v>

72
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like you think you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that unless there's a good reason.</v>

73
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.110
<v Speaker 1>You have to know we better start this </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and we're going to be carrying it </v>

74
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>around for the next 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may be is enough motivation,</v>

75
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>so you'll actually try hard to solve a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

76
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot easier to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going there,</v>

78
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>but then good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll have it every day,</v>

79
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every God damn day for the rest of your </v>

80
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
