1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's really useful to not defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to vociferously,</v>

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>which is weird because you'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:08.780
<v Speaker 1>you have the right to defend yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no all,</v>

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>no holds barred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually doesn't work that way.</v>

6
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.590
<v Speaker 1>You have to defend yourself with minimal</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary force.</v>

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.330
<v Speaker 1>And I think I managed that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel for interview for thank God,</v>

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>but I mean believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been talking to me about </v>

9
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>that nonstop for 15 months and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening</v>

10
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.520
<v Speaker 2>and it wouldn't work as well if he </v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't done that right.</v>

11
00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:29.950
<v Speaker 2>If you just show laughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

12
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 2>The idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he'd just gotten right at her and </v>

13
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.661
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you are saying is so stupid for </v>

14
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:36.661
<v Speaker 2>these five reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would,</v>

15
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 2>it would have been bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's actually the fact that </v>

16
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 2>you sat there and he just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

17
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 2>you're asking good questions and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

18
00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:46.711
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you're asking good </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions demonstrates the validity of </v>

19
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 2>your entire viewpoint that that was much</v>
<v Speaker 2>more effective.</v>

20
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

21
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.400
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the things I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditating on for the last years.</v>

22
00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:52.900
<v Speaker 2>There's a line in the new testament </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

23
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:53.950
<v Speaker 2>resist not evil.</v>

24
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.580
<v Speaker 1>What the hell are you supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like because it's really a </v>

26
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 1>difficult thing to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really mean that you don't resist</v>

27
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 1>evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of problems is if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch back then you have a fight.</v>

29
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't just not defend yourself </v>

30
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.681
<v Speaker 1>like weekly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be weak and not defend </v>

31
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:20.961
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can be strong and defend </v>

32
00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>yourself minimally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real art.</v>

33
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the essence of sophistication.</v>

34
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not,</v>

35
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from kind of a rough place.</v>

36
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming from northern Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from the frontier,</v>

37
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:36.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my town was scraped out of the bloody </v>

38
00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:36.381
<v Speaker 1>prairie 50 years before people moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

39
00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>before I lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

40
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

41
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.990
<v Speaker 1>it's been an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a continual challenge to just </v>

42
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 1>my sophistication to the level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge and I've,</v>

43
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to do that.</v>

44
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't always manage it.</v>

45
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to that point,</v>

46
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:59.311
<v Speaker 3>do you think that we sometimes actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>at a deep level use identity politics </v>

47
00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 3>against ourselves in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this regard?</v>

48
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:03.760
<v Speaker 3>So you're sitting across from Kathy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's female.</v>

49
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At some level.</v>

50
00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you may be moderated it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that?</v>

51
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.130
<v Speaker 3>Because had it been a male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

52
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 3>and you talk about this often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have to act differently towards </v>

53
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 3>males and females and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical,</v>

54
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.130
<v Speaker 3>there's a physical reasons for that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological reasons for that,</v>

55
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.260
<v Speaker 3>but that had she been a male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

56
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.950
<v Speaker 3>say the same exact age from you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Alberta and all of that,</v>

57
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 3>that perhaps your response might have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been a little more forceful even though </v>

58
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.301
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all agreeing your response was </v>

59
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:33.301
<v Speaker 3>done correctly and evenhandedly.</v>

60
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I.</v>

61
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.540
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably yes.</v>

62
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.930
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because you did like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

63
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:45.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you can say that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight with a woman the same way that you</v>

64
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:48.520
<v Speaker 1>fight with a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean you can't fight with a</v>

65
00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:50.020
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean you shouldn't,</v>

66
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.240
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think the rules are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

67
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are the rules different?</v>

68
00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the rules are,</v>

69
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a physical limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more stringent,</v>

70
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

71
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a level of hinting out physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat that you can bring to bear in a </v>

72
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:11.551
<v Speaker 1>conversation between men that you cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring to bear in a conversation with a </v>

73
00:03:11.551 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

74
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.220
<v Speaker 1>and the mechanics of that are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very subtle and difficult and it's </v>

75
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.571
<v Speaker 1>especially challenging in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual discussion because an </v>

76
00:03:21.571 --> 00:03:25.441
<v Speaker 1>intellectual discussion is a kind of war</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't obvious how men and women </v>

77
00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>should go to war with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

78
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:28.700
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to sort that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

79
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.410
<v Speaker 1>my sense has been on the panels that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done is that I definitely have to </v>

80
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>pull my punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm on a panel with women,</v>

81
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.070
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that it's any less </v>

82
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>challenging intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the strategy and the attitude has to</v>

83
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:50.791
<v Speaker 1>be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more likely that you'll be </v>

84
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:54.631
<v Speaker 1>seen as a bully if you bring the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>force to bear on a female opponent as </v>

85
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>you would on a male opponent.</v>
