00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the question is why don't,</v>

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>why do people pursue rewards that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce this resonance?</v>

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a value hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so pleasure island.</v>

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those kids that were brought there were </v>

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>lost so they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have anywhere to go.</v>

6
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:21.531
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have an identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they default to local pleasure and </v>

7
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:28.611
<v Speaker 1>that's better than none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the problem with local </v>

8
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:28.611
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while as the narrative made clear,</v>

9
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:33.501
<v Speaker 1>is that you better look out if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive because it's going to kick </v>

10
00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:37.251
<v Speaker 1>back on Newhart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason is you're only </v>

11
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:38.150
<v Speaker 1>considering the immediate timeframe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the problem is,</v>

12
00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>is that things propagate across all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeframes and so just because something</v>

13
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>works really well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this second,</v>

14
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.460
<v Speaker 1>cocaine for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean that it's a tenable </v>

15
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.091
<v Speaker 1>solution to the class of all problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So usually often people pursue local </v>

16
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>pleasure because that's the best they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can imagine.</v>

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>It's the best they've been taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't see another alternative.</v>

18
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.250
<v Speaker 1>So it could be ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be they don't want to adopt the </v>

19
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.801
<v Speaker 1>responsibility because part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with working at every level of </v>

20
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy simultaneously is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

21
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.820
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

22
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like dancing to a very complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>waltz,</v>

23
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be paying attention to a </v>

24
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>very large number of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously and doing things right.</v>

25
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:26.590
<v Speaker 1>It requires responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

26
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pain.</v>

27
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason people drink alcohol </v>

28
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>is to get rid of their responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

29
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.840
<v Speaker 1>that's what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear people drink because they have </v>

30
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.840
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

31
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

32
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.320
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people drink because they're </v>

33
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>anxious and alcoholics drink because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in withdrawal.</v>

34
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.250
<v Speaker 1>But young people drink because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick and tired of being responsible </v>

35
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 1>because it's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

36
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>so I'll drink enough.</v>

37
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I won't care about the medium to </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm consequences because alcohol,</v>

38
00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:02.091
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what alcohol does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make you ignorant of the </v>

39
00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 1>medium to longterm consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes you not care about them.</v>

40
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>And partly it's because it dampens </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

41
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.620
<v Speaker 1>So it dampens anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves your positive emotion circuits </v>

42
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.340
<v Speaker 1>intact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you can go out there and do </v>

43
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.340
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun things and that's like,</v>

44
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a party really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go do stupid fun things.</v>

45
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the medium to longterm consequences </v>

46
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's risky.</v>

47
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's risky.</v>

48
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know better.</v>

49
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the answer I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
