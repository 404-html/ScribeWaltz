1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about trump?</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>What's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on there?</v>

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting listening to trump's </v>
<v Speaker 1>inauguration speech because are detected</v>

5
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>elements of national socialist thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not being dismissive.</v>

7
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:21.441
<v Speaker 1>I'm seriously not being dismissive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you radically activate on the </v>

8
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:26.541
<v Speaker 1>side of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you call forth compensatory forces and </v>

9
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>they're not in your control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like Trump opened his speech.</v>

10
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>You just read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a 1950 socialist,</v>

11
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to use the power of the state</v>

12
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>to bring the industry home to produce a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of infrastructure.</v>

13
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a state business unity with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state in charge.</v>

14
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end of his speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where he stopped speaking,</v>

15
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>at least the international kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist,</v>

16
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

17
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>borders are really important and so is </v>
<v Speaker 1>national identity and you know,</v>

18
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>he does embed that within belief in God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably a good thing,</v>

19
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>assuming that he's serious about that.</v>

20
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.970
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that trump was elected in the </v>

21
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.800
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was such a fight between him </v>

22
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.421
<v Speaker 1>and the Clintonites and that the Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 1>nights were playing identity politics </v>

23
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>instead of speaking for the working </v>
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>

24
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>who then trump co-opted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he should have.</v>

25
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there there's a war going on there.</v>

26
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>And then what about brexit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on there?</v>

27
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:18.810
<v Speaker 1>And what about France with Marine Le </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pen?</v>

28
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>And what about Holland with wilderness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in a chaotic time and you know,</v>

30
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I've got letters from people all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world who tell me how they can't say</v>

31
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

32
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:35.871
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not very good and they're </v>

33
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:37.671
<v Speaker 1>kind of happy with me because maybe they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that are emboldened them in some </v>

34
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>way and so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for that.</v>

35
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Hypothetically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of the people who wrote me the </v>

36
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming majority were reasonable.</v>

37
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>So pretty happy about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

38
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.230
<v Speaker 1>and maybe I'm wrong about my damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis because like what do I know?</v>

39
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:54.231
<v Speaker 1>But I do have this proclivity to get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of things and what's out the </v>

40
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:57.340
<v Speaker 1>bottom of this as an ideological war or </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical war.</v>

41
00:01:57.341 --> 00:02:02.341
<v Speaker 1>It's even deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might even be deeper than a </v>

42
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:05.061
<v Speaker 1>philosophical bore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something that's more like a </v>

43
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:05.430
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical or theological war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

44
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how far down you look and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the postmodernist know exactly what </v>

45
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't accidental.</v>

46
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:15.831
<v Speaker 1>Of course you shut down speakers you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't agree with because you can't have </v>

47
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 1>a dialogue within then anyways because </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings can't have dialogue.</v>

48
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

49
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the postmodern world.</v>

50
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.910
<v Speaker 1>It's the hogs nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everyone against everyone else </v>

51
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>except it's not individuals.</v>

52
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>It's groups and you're stuck in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn group and it's the only thing about</v>

53
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:34.260
<v Speaker 1>you anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's relevant,</v>

54
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>which is why we might base our hiring on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

55
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:41.661
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're oppressed and even if you </v>

56
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:45.051
<v Speaker 1>don't know it just only because you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>internalized it and it's the only thing </v>

57
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:48.051
<v Speaker 1>that's real about you anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can't talk to you because I'm in </v>

58
00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:52.071
<v Speaker 1>my own little silo of privileged belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>and besides we can't use logic because </v>

59
00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:56.331
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't exist and so you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group and I'm in a group and all we can </v>

60
00:02:56.331 --> 00:03:00.171
<v Speaker 1>do is have a war or we can talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't get to talk because he </v>

61
00:03:00.171 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>can't talk if you're a postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 1>because speech is just chatter,</v>

62
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>so when it's just chatter that supports </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people in power,</v>

63
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:12.841
<v Speaker 1>that's how they think and so the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is this little arm war of identity</v>

64
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>group against identity group against </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity group,</v>

65
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 1>and you shut down people who don't agree</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you because why should you let them</v>

66
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>talk?</v>

67
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>It's you don't believe in any of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why you would let someone talk.</v>

68
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>So this isn't accidental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not [inaudible] they're afraid.</v>

69
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Although it's also because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hijack,</v>

70
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>

71
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 1>They hijack compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make anyone who who puts forward an</v>

72
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:44.041
<v Speaker 1>alternative view into a terrorist of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and someone who's heartless at the</v>

73
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really incredibly intelligent.</v>

74
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:52.021
<v Speaker 1>It's such a good strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so devious and brilliant and it's </v>

75
00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:56.401
<v Speaker 1>so effective because who wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell wants to be labeled a </v>

76
00:03:56.401 --> 00:03:57.350
<v Speaker 1>bigot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably are a damn big.</v>

77
00:03:57.351 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just like everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

78
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>and it's easy to make people feel guilty</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

79
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they should.</v>
