1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.960
<v Speaker 1>This is a story that the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians predicated their society on,</v>

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.710
<v Speaker 1>and to understand this story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you have to know is what</v>

3
00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:10.780
<v Speaker 1>the characters were in these characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>were gods.</v>

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.500
<v Speaker 1>There's four of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the Egyptians had far more than</v>

5
00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:19.501
<v Speaker 1>four gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think of these as the central </v>

6
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Gods and you might think what is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>central God and then you might think,</v>

7
00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:26.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that the gods compete for </v>

8
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:28.411
<v Speaker 1>dominance across time in people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginations and some gods when they </v>

9
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:33.280
<v Speaker 1>occupied the primary position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance in the hierarchy,</v>

10
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>in the dominance hierarchy of gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are ideals and ideals compete </v>

11
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>across time for dominance and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied,</v>

12
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 1>and so when diverse tribal people come </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

13
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 1>they throw all their gods into the ring </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they fight across time and something</v>

14
00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:55.081
<v Speaker 1>emerges as a victor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the emergence of monotheism </v>

15
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:58.801
<v Speaker 1>out of polytheism and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It parallels the development of a </v>

16
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:04.031
<v Speaker 1>unified morality in within each of us as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we develop across time and the the god </v>

17
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>that emerges as dominant across time </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears a substantial,</v>

18
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>represent a substantial</v>

19
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>resemblance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you have a set of gods in this </v>

20
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.630
<v Speaker 1>locale that are competing across time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and something emerges as dominant,</v>

21
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>and then over here you have another set </v>
<v Speaker 1>of gods that compete across time for </v>

22
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.291
<v Speaker 1>dominance and something emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see major commonalities across </v>

23
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:34.150
<v Speaker 1>the two things that emerge and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for that is because the emergent,</v>

24
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.290
<v Speaker 1>the process of emergence that gives rise</v>
<v Speaker 1>to both of them is similar in both </v>

25
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.691
<v Speaker 1>situations and that's part of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts for the cross cultural </v>

26
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 1>similarity of high order religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

27
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.590
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

28
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.960
<v Speaker 1>you need to know the characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

29
00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:54.961
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus Cyrus is the old king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's Dumbledore.</v>

30
00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:58.360
<v Speaker 1>For all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the king.</v>

31
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>He's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the spirit that established the </v>

32
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was young,</v>

33
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:07.480
<v Speaker 1>he was a great hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now he's old and he's willing.</v>

34
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.230
<v Speaker 1>He's our cat and he's willfully blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Cyrus.</v>

35
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>He has a brother Seth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seth is set and set is Satan because the</v>

36
00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:22.750
<v Speaker 1>word Satan comes from the word Seth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>set via the Coptic Christians.</v>

37
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

38
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 1>So he's a precursor to the western idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Satan.</v>

39
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 1>You have isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis is queen of the underworld,</v>

40
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:36.901
<v Speaker 1>and Isis was the goddess of a religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that prevailed across </v>

41
00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:43.480
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis and you have horace.</v>

42
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Horace is a Falcon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Egyptian,</v>

43
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's knows that.</v>

44
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I write the eye with the open pupil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's horace.</v>

45
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.050
<v Speaker 1>And Horace is a fall can because falcons</v>
<v Speaker 1>can see way better.</v>

46
00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.110
<v Speaker 1>They can see better than us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can see better than anything else </v>

47
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>except for eagles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they fly above everything.</v>

48
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Zazu in lion king is horace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and move Fossa is Cyrus and scar is seth</v>

49
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>and there no specific representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis,</v>

50
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>but the closest there is in that story </v>
<v Speaker 1>is probably the queen of the hyenas.</v>

51
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>That's played by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's the actress?</v>

52
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Um</v>

53
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

54
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoopi Goldberg.</v>

55
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.030
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

56
00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Because they inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like the queen of the underworld,</v>

57
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:38.301
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the queen of the hygienists that </v>

58
00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:38.301
<v Speaker 1>live out among the death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

59
00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

60
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Seth Osiris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seth,</v>

61
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and horace.</v>

62
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Here's how the story goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cirrus is a great king.</v>

63
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>He established the Egyptian state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could think about him as the </v>

64
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.910
<v Speaker 1>embodiment of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Egyptian customs and tradition.</v>

65
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.540
<v Speaker 1>You can think about him as the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the pyramid represents.</v>

66
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.330
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was great when he was young,</v>

67
00:04:02.331 --> 00:04:05.990
<v Speaker 1>but he's not young anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's old and he's willfully blind,</v>

68
00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:08.720
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see what he could see.</v>

69
00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:11.330
<v Speaker 1>He refuses to see what he could see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is,</v>

70
00:04:11.331 --> 00:04:16.331
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cirrus old and willfully blind because </v>

71
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:18.551
<v Speaker 1>that's what culture is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a paternal spirit that's old and </v>

72
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>willfully blind and it's always that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

73
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 1>always that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is because it's </v>

74
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.950
<v Speaker 1>a construction of the dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dad aren't alive,</v>

75
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're out of date and they can </v>

76
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.680
<v Speaker 1>update themselves anymore and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabit their corpse.</v>

77
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually what happens in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier story that I'll tell you next </v>

78
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The early Mesopotamian gods inhabited </v>

79
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 1>the corpse of their father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking anyway.</v>

80
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

81
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus was great and when he was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't young anymore.</v>

82
00:04:45.171 --> 00:04:50.171
<v Speaker 1>He's old and he's willfully blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He won't look where he knows he should </v>

83
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:53.501
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have the energy or maybe he </v>

84
00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.301
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have the spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His brother Seth is not a good guy and </v>

85
00:04:55.301 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he underestimates his malevolence </v>

86
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.040
<v Speaker 1>and power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so seth wants to rule the kingdom.</v>

87
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.200
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>

88
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Every stable society is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is threatened by willful blindness and </v>

89
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.190
<v Speaker 1>malevolence always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every bureaucracy has that proclivity to</v>

90
00:05:13.191 --> 00:05:18.191
<v Speaker 1>stagnate and to become blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why corporations die all the </v>

91
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:21.971
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why a fortune 500 company only </v>

92
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:22.940
<v Speaker 1>last 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why we have to have elections.</v>

93
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.780
<v Speaker 1>It's to stop the Dad from staying in </v>
<v Speaker 1>control for too long.</v>

94
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Seth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

95
00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus turns a blind eye to seth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seth is happy about that.</v>

96
00:05:31.611 --> 00:05:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Same thing happens in the lion king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

97
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Seth one day waits for Cyrus to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake and to be weak,</v>

98
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>and he attacks him and he chops it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>into pieces and he distributes the </v>

99
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.230
<v Speaker 1>pieces across the entire Egyptian state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

100
00:05:45.231 --> 00:05:48.470
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians regarded their provinces </v>
<v Speaker 1>as pieces of,</v>

101
00:05:48.471 --> 00:05:49.610
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus's body.</v>

102
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you can kill.</v>

103
00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus,</v>

104
00:05:53.481 --> 00:05:55.910
<v Speaker 1>because he's a god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is he god a God?</v>

105
00:05:55.911 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Because he represents the of structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always structure.</v>

106
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:03.740
<v Speaker 1>It can't be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always reconstitutes itself,</v>

107
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:08.741
<v Speaker 1>it can be hurt and broken into pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what happens to a </v>

108
00:06:08.741 --> 00:06:09.620
<v Speaker 1>cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things fall apart.</v>

109
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they get old and because </v>

110
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 1>malevolence undermines them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the Egyptians were trying to</v>

111
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 1>sort out.</v>

112
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so seth distributed says,</v>

113
00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus all over Egypt.</v>

114
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 1>So he can't get himself back together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

115
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Things fall apart and they can't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought back together.</v>

116
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>But the spirit of Vocera is still lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the pieces.</v>

117
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orders demolished.</v>

118
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>What would you expect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos emerges.</v>

119
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>That's isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis is queen of the underworld.</v>

120
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 1>She's Cyrus's wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>order and chaos.</v>

121
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:47.921
<v Speaker 1>Just like the Yin and the Yang order </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapses upcoming the queen of the </v>

122
00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's looking for order.</v>

123
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Chaos cries out for order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's looking for order.</v>

124
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 1>She goes all around Egypt trying to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>our.</v>

125
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>So Cyrus back together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a state of chaos.</v>

126
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 1>She finds this fellas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She makes herself pregnant with it.</v>

127
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

128
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 1>it means it's like it's like Japan in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the belly of the whale.</v>

129
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.450
<v Speaker 1>That thing has the potential to reemerge</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

130
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 1>The thing that collapses into its </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces.</v>

131
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.060
<v Speaker 1>It's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can unite with the chaos and produce </v>

132
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.471
<v Speaker 1>something new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of the disillusion of </v>

133
00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:24.340
<v Speaker 1>structure into chaos and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverification.</v>

134
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Ice just makes herself pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes back down to the underworld.</v>

135
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:32.800
<v Speaker 1>She gives birth to horace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horace is the Egyptian Ayesha.</v>

136
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 1>He's the son of the great father and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>great mother.</v>

137
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a messianic figure and in fact,</v>

138
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.930
<v Speaker 1>much of the mythology that described </v>
<v Speaker 1>horace was extracted without much </v>

139
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 1>modification and then attributed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

140
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Very much memory and you can read about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the parallels.</v>

141
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.370
<v Speaker 1>You can read about it online if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

142
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.680
<v Speaker 1>There's any number of parallels and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course there is the mythology that the </v>

143
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Jews came out of Egypt and of course the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christians,</v>

144
00:07:57.631 --> 00:08:02.631
<v Speaker 1>he emerged from the Jews and so there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a tremendous influence of Egyptian </v>

145
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:06.140
<v Speaker 1>thinking on the development of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>later ideas and you see pictures of Isis</v>

146
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:11.141
<v Speaker 1>with horace on her lap that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually identical in content and form </v>

147
00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 1>to the later pictures of Mary with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>infant Christ.</v>

148
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.310
<v Speaker 1>But that's the holy mother of God and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero.</v>

149
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a Christian motif.</v>

150
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.440
<v Speaker 1>It's far deeper than a Christian motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a human motif.</v>

151
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.980
<v Speaker 1>So Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>queen of the underworld gives birth to </v>

152
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>horace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horace grows up outside the kingdom.</v>

153
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In underworld?</v>

154
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what human beings do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're alienated from your culture </v>

155
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:34.990
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

156
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.790
<v Speaker 1>It's old and dead and corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that leaves you growing up in </v>

157
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.220
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

158
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.030
<v Speaker 1>what would you call alienated from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental culture?</v>

159
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of adolescence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horace grows up.</v>

160
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 1>He can see that's what differentiates </v>
<v Speaker 1>them from,</v>

161
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus,</v>

162
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 1>that's why he's a faulconer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes and has a fight with seth.</v>

163
00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:00.050
<v Speaker 1>And now the difference between those </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyrusone and Horace is that horse does </v>

164
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>not underestimate seth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows exactly what he's up against.</v>

165
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 1>He goes and has a terrible battle with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him trying to get his kingdom back.</v>

166
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Something else that's echoed in the lion</v>
<v Speaker 1>king story and well,</v>

167
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Horus and seth are fighting seth </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists out one of his eyes.</v>

168
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

169
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Because Seth is the embodiment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction and malevolence,</v>

170
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 1>and no matter how conscious you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you encounter that even voluntarily,</v>

171
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:28.941
<v Speaker 1>the probability that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage your consciousness is </v>

172
00:09:28.941 --> 00:09:30.130
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's white.</v>

173
00:09:30.131 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>People don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the eyes torn out,</v>

174
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.990
<v Speaker 1>but seth is defeated and Horace banishes</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to the nether regions of the </v>

175
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 1>kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't kill them.</v>

176
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the malevolent destructive </v>

177
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:46.010
<v Speaker 1>force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the threatened states never dies.</v>

178
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 1>It's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only remove it temporarily.</v>

179
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Now Horace is King Pharaoh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>King God.</v>

180
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 1>He's got his eye and so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

181
00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:02.541
<v Speaker 1>he's going to just pop that back in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand and then he's going to be able to </v>

182
00:10:02.541 --> 00:10:05.841
<v Speaker 1>lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be able to take his place </v>

183
00:10:05.841 --> 00:10:08.220
<v Speaker 1>at the upper most pantheon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pantheon of gods properly,</v>

184
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes his eye and he goes back to the</v>

185
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 1>underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like Pinocchio,</v>

186
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:20.061
<v Speaker 1>going into the depths to rescue Japan </v>
<v Speaker 1>and down there is the spirit of Cyrus </v>

187
00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:22.890
<v Speaker 1>who's who's extent as a kind of half dad</v>
<v Speaker 1>ghost,</v>

188
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.020
<v Speaker 1>and it gives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

189
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I now we'll cyrus can see.</v>

190
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.170
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go down into the chaotic,</v>

191
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 1>when threatened by malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even to the point of damage to your </v>

192
00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:45.991
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go down into the chaos and you find </v>

193
00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:49.441
<v Speaker 1>the dead spirit of your tradition and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you give it vision and so provided with </v>

194
00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:56.251
<v Speaker 1>vision or Cyrus regenerates and then no </v>
<v Speaker 1>Osiris and horus go back up to to to the</v>

195
00:10:56.501 --> 00:11:01.501
<v Speaker 1>world linked together and rule jointly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Egyptians believed that the </v>

196
00:11:04.091 --> 00:11:09.091
<v Speaker 1>Pharaoh who had an immortal spirit was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the embodiment of the conjunction of </v>

197
00:11:09.581 --> 00:11:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Horus and Osiris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what gave him sovereignty.</v>

198
00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.640
<v Speaker 1>So when you think about how brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

199
00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:18.730
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians are trying to puzzle out </v>
<v Speaker 1>who should lead,</v>

200
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 1>who should be feral and what do you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be if you're going to be feral in </v>

201
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.511
<v Speaker 1>order for things to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be awake to malevolence and </v>

202
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.840
<v Speaker 1>chaos and you have to embody your </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition and that puts you at the </v>

203
00:11:33.971 --> 00:11:36.850
<v Speaker 1>highest pinnacle of the dominant </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

204
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.900
<v Speaker 1>It's and that's the same as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

205
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:46.230
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing as the battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the gods across centuries or </v>

206
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Ian's and the emergence of the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible moral virtue as a consequence </v>

207
00:11:51.521 --> 00:11:56.500
<v Speaker 1>of that competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the eye on the top of the pyramid,</v>

208
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you know,</v>

209
00:11:58.291 --> 00:12:03.291
<v Speaker 1>and the Washington monument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a cap on the Washington </v>

210
00:12:03.291 --> 00:12:03.291
<v Speaker 1>monument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the protopic,</v>

211
00:12:03.291 --> 00:12:05.890
<v Speaker 1>The Washington monument is a pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the top of the pyramid is a cap.</v>

212
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of aluminum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason it's made out of aluminum</v>

213
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:11.170
<v Speaker 1>is because when they made the Washington</v>
<v Speaker 1>monument,</v>

214
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 1>it was the most valuable metal known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what does it mean?</v>

215
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.920
<v Speaker 1>It means there's a pyramid and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something at the top of it,</v>

216
00:12:17.921 --> 00:12:22.921
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that's at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid isn't the same as the rest of </v>

217
00:12:22.921 --> 00:12:23.920
<v Speaker 1>the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

218
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 1>The pyramid exists.</v>

219
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something climbs up to the top,</v>

220
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:30.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just at the top of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid.</v>

221
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.300
<v Speaker 1>It's at the top of all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that rises to the top of any </v>

222
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.350
<v Speaker 1>given pyramid is the same thing that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominate all pyramids.</v>

223
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 1>It isn't good enough to be the best at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>

224
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:49.530
<v Speaker 1>What you want to be is the best at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>set of all possible dominance </v>

225
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

226
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that's gold at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the pyramid,</v>

227
00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:55.870
<v Speaker 1>and that's the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the Egyptians figured out,</v>

228
00:12:55.871 --> 00:13:00.871
<v Speaker 1>and what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means the thing that puts you at the </v>

229
00:13:00.871 --> 00:13:03.280
<v Speaker 1>top is attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay Attention,</v>

230
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.040
<v Speaker 1>keep your eyes open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same as thinking.</v>

231
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like watching and the thing about </v>

232
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.051
<v Speaker 1>human beings is we can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see better than any other </v>

233
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:21.181
<v Speaker 1>creature except birds of prey and so our</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to see is in fact what we use </v>

234
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:25.750
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our brains are actually organized around</v>

235
00:13:25.751 --> 00:13:27.280
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike most animals,</v>

236
00:13:27.281 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 1>their brains are organized around smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not us.</v>

237
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:35.490
<v Speaker 1>We can see we stand upright so we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see a long distance and in our ability </v>

238
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.421
<v Speaker 1>to see is what saves us and what saves </v>
<v Speaker 1>our communities and that's what these </v>

239
00:13:39.421 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 1>stories are trying to portray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

240
00:13:42.851 --> 00:13:46.780
<v Speaker 1>well why didn't people just say so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>An answer to that is because they didn't</v>

241
00:13:46.781 --> 00:13:47.290
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

242
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.080
<v Speaker 1>It took a long time to figure it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

243
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:57.120
<v Speaker 1>It's taken forever to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

244
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.360
<v Speaker 1>It's part of what I hoped when I wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>this book and part of the reason that </v>

245
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:07.591
<v Speaker 1>I'm teaching it is because it seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that it would be useful for everyone </v>

246
00:14:07.591 --> 00:14:10.840
<v Speaker 1>to actually understand this instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>just having it told as a story.</v>

247
00:14:10.841 --> 00:14:11.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great,</v>

248
00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:12.580
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

249
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:16.210
<v Speaker 1>you need the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why not also just understand it</v>

250
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:18.570
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

251
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:22.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what we're trying to do.</v>

252
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.170
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to understand this,</v>

253
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.120
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

254
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.160
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough for today.</v>
