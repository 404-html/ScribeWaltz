00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.420
<v Speaker 1>There's this idea in Christianity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've discussed briefly that the judge </v>

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>and the redeemer are the same figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know in the book of revelation,</v>

3
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:13.911
<v Speaker 1>you may know this and you may not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ comes back as a judge and he has </v>

4
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>a sword coming into a revelatory vision </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that book,</v>

5
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the last thing you'd expect.</v>

6
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Conservative Christians is to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

7
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a visionary hallucination,</v>

8
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:32.211
<v Speaker 1>the book of revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Christ comes back with a sword </v>

9
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:35.391
<v Speaker 1>coming out of his mouth and he comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>back as a judge and he divides the </v>

10
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>damned from the redeemed and most are </v>
<v Speaker 1>damned in some are redeemed is a very,</v>

11
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:43.311
<v Speaker 1>very harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now young believed that the figure of </v>

12
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Christ in the Gospels was too agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>to merciful,</v>

13
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.300
<v Speaker 1>to tilted towards mercy and that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>called out for a counter position and </v>

14
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>that was the counter position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment.</v>

15
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

16
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:58.850
<v Speaker 1>but then there's this melding of the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that the judge and the redeemer or</v>

17
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

18
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this young man told me that his life </v>

19
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.941
<v Speaker 1>lacked purpose and direction and meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that he was nihilistic until he </v>

20
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:16.401
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He read Zen and the art of motorcycle </v>

21
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>maintenance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a book I actually liked quite a</v>

22
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:21.951
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read it three times at different </v>

23
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:23.511
<v Speaker 1>decades of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that's very </v>

24
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>interesting about that book is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an examination of the idea of quality,</v>

25
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>of the idea that there are qualitative </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinctions between things and that we </v>

26
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>have an instinct to make qualitative </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinctions,</v>

27
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>and so equality is tate of distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>is simply this is better than that,</v>

28
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>which is a judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

29
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:44.511
<v Speaker 1>Now what ratzinger is hypothesizing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the person in and up.</v>

30
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>You know how the idea of the modern idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you're supposed to accept yourself.</v>

31
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an insane idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

32
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Really I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of a more nihilistic idea </v>

33
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>then that you're already okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

34
00:01:57.631 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

35
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.600
<v Speaker 1>and the reason you're not is could you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be way more than you are,</v>

36
00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>and so what do you want to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be okay as you are or do you</v>

37
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>want to strive towards what's better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this young man,</v>

38
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>this Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said that the reason that Zen and</v>

39
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:16.761
<v Speaker 1>the art of motorcycle maintenance had </v>
<v Speaker 1>such an impact on him was because he </v>

40
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>wasn't happy with his current mode of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being right.</v>

41
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:23.361
<v Speaker 1>He didn't consider the manner in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>he conducted himself sufficient and the </v>

42
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:29.121
<v Speaker 1>fact that the author of Zen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was laid out.</v>

43
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:34.191
<v Speaker 1>The notion that you could make </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualitative distinctions and there </v>

44
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:37.131
<v Speaker 1>really was a difference between good </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and bad things are great things </v>

45
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:37.131
<v Speaker 1>and evil things.</v>

46
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>It gives you direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you,</v>

47
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>gives you the possibility of moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>upward and and ratzinger is pointing out</v>

48
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.580
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are insufficient in and of </v>

49
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.331
<v Speaker 1>themselves and need the movement upward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they need to conceptualize </v>

50
00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>something like the highest good and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>to strive for that.</v>

51
00:02:55.351 --> 00:03:00.351
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is is that there isn't any</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between conceptualizing the </v>

52
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>good and being judged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're going to conceptualize</v>

53
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>the good and move towards what you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do is separate from yourself.</v>

54
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:13.621
<v Speaker 1>All those things that aren't good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave them behind and that's why the </v>

55
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>redeemer and the judge or the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

56
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>appalling,</v>

57
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:22.981
<v Speaker 1>I think about our modern world is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're rejecting the notion of </v>

58
00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>qualitative distinctions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

59
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings</v>

60
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>by saying that one thing is better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>

61
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

62
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:34.081
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun to be cast off with the </v>

63
00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>damned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure,</v>

64
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.170
<v Speaker 1>but if people are in fact insufficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet in their present condition,</v>

65
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean try finding someone who isn't.</v>

66
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Then if you deny the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualitative distinction because you want</v>

67
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:54.871
<v Speaker 1>to promote a radical egalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you remove the possibility of </v>

68
00:03:54.871 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>redemption because there's no movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the good.</v>

69
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe to sacrifice the good for.</v>

70
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a catastrophe to sacrifice the good</v>

71
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:07.910
<v Speaker 1>for the equal because for us to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>equal,</v>

72
00:04:07.911 --> 00:04:12.911
<v Speaker 1>it would be mean as far as I can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we would all be equally unredeemed </v>

73
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>and miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
