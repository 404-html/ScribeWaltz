00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.280
<v Speaker 1>And men are pretty good at taking care </v>
<v Speaker 1>of children,</v>

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:02.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I would say they're not as good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking care of infants as women are </v>

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>because they don't have the full range </v>
<v Speaker 1>of resources at hand and they're not.</v>

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they have the same kind of</v>

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.910
<v Speaker 1>immediate intuitive understanding of or </v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction to babies that men have.</v>

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that switches around the age of </v>
<v Speaker 1>two or two and a half when the kids can </v>

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.771
<v Speaker 1>engage in rough and tumble play because </v>
<v Speaker 1>men are much more likely to engage in </v>

9
00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:34.911
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble play with children than</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are and rough and tumble play </v>

10
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>seems to be one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolizes children.</v>

11
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you have to learn</v>

12
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:45.291
<v Speaker 1>when you're a child is what actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurts you and what can be ignored and </v>

13
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>what actually hurts someone else and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what can be ignored.</v>

14
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>And the best way to learn that is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble play.</v>

15
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing with a kid,</v>

16
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.930
<v Speaker 1>they get more and more excited than they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

17
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:58.120
<v Speaker 1>More and more crazy things until they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that either hurts them or,</v>

18
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>or hurts you and then you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

19
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

20
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

21
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a dance in a sense,</v>

22
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:09.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're wrestling with a little kid </v>

23
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>and you have to let them win fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently because otherwise they don't.</v>

24
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>They don't continue the game and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell that because if they're,</v>

25
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>if the game is going well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're laughing with insane delight </v>

26
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>because kids just love rough and tumble </v>
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>

27
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

28
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>and they love crazy things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can throw them in the air and</v>

29
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>catch them and they think that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

30
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

31
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>but partly what you're doing is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>extending their body in all sorts of </v>

32
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.040
<v Speaker 1>ways and getting them to learn in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied sense where the limits of that,</v>

33
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>where their limits are and where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>limits of other people are.</v>

34
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's embodied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And children who haven't had that man,</v>

35
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>they're just so awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

36
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might have some hypothetical sense </v>

37
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>of how to interact with another person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have an embodied sense of</v>

38
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:52.131
<v Speaker 1>it and they can't tell the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between what hurts them and what </v>

39
00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:52.131
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:52.780
<v Speaker 1>because often at a young child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

41
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>if they're startled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll start to cry and then you can </v>

42
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

43
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't hurt.</v>

44
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

45
00:01:58.291 --> 00:01:59.820
<v Speaker 1>that didn't hurt and they'll stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>crying.</v>

46
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.000
<v Speaker 1>But if they haven't had their limits </v>
<v Speaker 1>tested,</v>

47
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>they'll cry at anything unexpected even </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't hurt.</v>

48
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's not good because if you cry </v>
<v Speaker 1>under all conditions,</v>

49
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:15.921
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you'll make friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're three is like zero because </v>

50
00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>another kid will start playing with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe play rough.</v>

51
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>And if you burst into terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>several times the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids just going to go somewhere else</v>

53
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>and find a different playmate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>they'll say you're just a baby.</v>
