1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of dream analysis I suppose is </v>

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.701
<v Speaker 1>one of Freud's perhaps Freud's major </v>
<v Speaker 1>contribution to modern western thought.</v>

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.490
<v Speaker 1>The idea was there was something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams and I suppose what I did is said,</v>

4
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

5
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:19.071
<v Speaker 1>isn't it strange we have this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>other form of thought that we engage in </v>

6
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>at night it and it speaks in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that we don't really understand</v>

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>and so what the hell is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>

8
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:32.451
<v Speaker 1>and many modern people do dreams are of </v>
<v Speaker 1>no significance or even that they're </v>

9
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>random processes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an absurd proposition obviously</v>

10
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>because they're by Terrell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they are,</v>

11
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 1>they're obviously not random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.660
<v Speaker 1>So Freud's idea was that there was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in dreams that was </v>

13
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.900
<v Speaker 1>informative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's his.</v>

14
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Now he had a method for describe for </v>
<v Speaker 1>extracting out from the dream what the </v>

15
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.460
<v Speaker 1>dream purported to represent and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlined that in great detail in the </v>

16
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:01.701
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to read one book by </v>

17
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would highly recommend that one.</v>

18
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a very long book and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>detailed,</v>

19
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:08.691
<v Speaker 1>but Freud does it extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive analysis of the way that </v>

20
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:12.501
<v Speaker 1>dreams work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he made the because because he had </v>

21
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:16.191
<v Speaker 1>brought a theoretical framework to bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even on his investigation into dream </v>

22
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:21.081
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he concluded that dreams were </v>

23
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.721
<v Speaker 1>essentially wish fulfillments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where young and Freud </v>

24
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>disagreed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also believed that the primary </v>

25
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 1>motivating factor of human beings with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual,</v>

26
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>and now that's a tougher one to toss </v>
<v Speaker 1>aside because even if you're a Darwinian</v>

27
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.560
<v Speaker 1>rather than afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to obviously support the </v>

28
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.611
<v Speaker 1>proposition that sexual motivation among</v>
<v Speaker 1>any living creature is going to be one </v>

29
00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:48.381
<v Speaker 1>of the highest order motivations because</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise creatures don't reproduce and </v>

30
00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>and prevail over the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

31
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>is that is that the ultimate source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation?</v>

32
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense the answer to that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be yes.</v>

33
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud wanted to make that in some ways </v>

34
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.011
<v Speaker 1>the sole source of motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm over simplifying and I hate to </v>

35
00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:07.311
<v Speaker 1>do that in relationship to Freud because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was not as simple minded character </v>

36
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:09.660
<v Speaker 1>young how to dream wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

37
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>that Freud and you were excavating a </v>
<v Speaker 1>basement.</v>

38
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 1>And so freud had outlined in Freud had </v>
<v Speaker 1>already discovered the basement,</v>

39
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:23.331
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the unconscious </v>

40
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 1>structure of the psyche and young broke </v>
<v Speaker 1>through into another basement that was a</v>

41
00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:26.460
<v Speaker 1>multi chambered place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many,</v>

42
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:31.461
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many rooms and I suppose what drove </v>

43
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:35.151
<v Speaker 1>young and freud apart was young's </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition that there was a hell of a </v>

44
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:36.090
<v Speaker 1>lot more going down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on down there.</v>

45
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:41.091
<v Speaker 1>Then had already met the eye and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>broke on the idea that the sexual </v>

46
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 1>impulse was primary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

47
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>they broke when you wrote a book called </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols of transformation,</v>

48
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:47.620
<v Speaker 1>which is actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

49
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>there's three books that I know of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are sort of like maps of meaning.</v>

50
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.060
<v Speaker 1>One is symbols of transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is a book by Eric Norman called the </v>

51
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.721
<v Speaker 1>origins and history of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the third and the third</v>

52
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while his maps of meaning,</v>

53
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>they're the same book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>

54
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to solve the same problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>from three different directions.</v>

55
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>They're all attempts to address the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

56
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.640
<v Speaker 1>And so symbols of transformation was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book that you wrote about the fantasies </v>

57
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>of schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American woman,</v>

58
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>and he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to relate her fantasies to</v>

59
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>these old mythological ideas and young's</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea essentially.</v>

60
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>And this is an idea that was shared by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like piaget,</v>

61
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:31.111
<v Speaker 1>so we were not going to say that you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Freud just pulled this idea out of </v>

62
00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the,</v>

63
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>the birthplace of myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology and literature for that matter</v>

64
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.260
<v Speaker 1>was the dream that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they share structural that they </v>

65
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.200
<v Speaker 1>share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sh,</v>

66
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>they share what mode of information </v>
<v Speaker 1>presentation and it's a relatively </v>

67
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:54.260
<v Speaker 1>radical hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

68
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.770
<v Speaker 1>but given that they both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both represent</v>

69
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.590
<v Speaker 2>hmm</v>

70
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.570
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams and mythological representations </v>

71
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.451
<v Speaker 1>share and essentially narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and they use their literary </v>

72
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:15.451
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not so unreasonable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that a dream at night is like the</v>

74
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:24.031
<v Speaker 1>movie that you play in your head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not unreasonable to note as well </v>

75
00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:28.351
<v Speaker 1>that the dreams that you have at night </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear a relationship to the daydreams </v>

76
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>that you have during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of cognition.</v>

77
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:32.170
<v Speaker 1>It seems like an involuntary form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognition though.</v>

78
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:37.171
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So young thought about the dream as </v>

79
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking of its own accord,</v>

80
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so his idea was,</v>

81
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

82
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>when you sleep you dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the dream happens to you,</v>

83
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not something that you create the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you don't even think about </v>

84
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.410
<v Speaker 1>creating it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I might say,</v>

85
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you thinking about?</v>

86
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:55.351
<v Speaker 1>And you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about whatever it is and </v>

87
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:58.381
<v Speaker 1>you'll take credit in some sense for </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that because it seems like a </v>

88
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:01.441
<v Speaker 1>voluntary activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what happens at night is that you </v>

89
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you think in voluntarily,</v>

90
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 1>and so what young would say is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that something is thinking in you</v>

91
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>and that's a perfectly reasonable way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it and this is one of the </v>

92
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.461
<v Speaker 1>things that's uncanny about the cycle </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysts as they they were willing to </v>

93
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:17.360
<v Speaker 1>take their observations to their logical</v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion.</v>

94
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.050
<v Speaker 1>There are things that think in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are those things and what are they </v>

95
00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:27.620
<v Speaker 1>thinking and why are they thinking it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

96
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.510
<v Speaker 1>if you do dream analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a tricky thing because who's</v>

97
00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:34.910
<v Speaker 1>to say if your damn analysis is correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

98
00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:37.370
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

99
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 1>If you do dream analysis with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you generally have them lay out their </v>

100
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.241
<v Speaker 1>dream and then you ask them when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through their dream of second </v>

101
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:50.471
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lay out their dream and you can </v>

102
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:51.881
<v Speaker 1>kind of get a picture of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they lay out their dream a </v>

103
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:54.951
<v Speaker 1>second time and as they go through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time they mentioned a detail or a </v>

104
00:05:54.951 --> 00:05:58.901
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ask them what that reminds them of </v>

105
00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:01.661
<v Speaker 1>and the is that the dream is presenting </v>
<v Speaker 1>an image or an idea that's associated </v>

106
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>with a network of ideas.</v>

107
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.430
<v Speaker 1>And then if you can expand on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>network of ideas as you go through the </v>

108
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can elaborate on the dream.</v>

109
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>You can expand it upwards and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to see what it might be attempting</v>

110
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 1>to put forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

111
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Freud's idea was that the dream knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was doing,</v>

112
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.490
<v Speaker 1>but that its content was being </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppressed and oppressed by an internal </v>

113
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>sensor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the dream had to be sneaky about what</v>

114
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 1>it was saying because it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliver a message that the person didn't</v>

115
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:34.961
<v Speaker 1>want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that was tied up with his idea of </v>

116
00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>repression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not young's idea.</v>

117
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young's idea was different.</v>

118
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:38.830
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

119
00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:43.831
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dream is trying to tell you what is </v>

120
00:06:43.831 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 1>trying to tell you as clear as it can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the best it can do,</v>

121
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>and so you could think of the dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is I believe,</v>

122
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>the right way to think about it.</v>

123
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.540
<v Speaker 1>The dream is the birthplace of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same way that artists are the </v>

124
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 1>birthplace of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same process.</v>

125
00:06:57.381 --> 00:07:02.240
<v Speaker 1>It's that your mind is groping outward </v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to comprehend what it has not yet</v>

126
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 1>comprehended and it does that first by </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to map it onto image and it's </v>

127
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>doing that in the dream and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat incoherent and and,</v>

128
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's stick within coherent because it's</v>

129
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:18.050
<v Speaker 1>not yet a full fledged thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the birthplace of thought.</v>

130
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a fantasy about what might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if you can grip the fantasy and</v>

131
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:29.861
<v Speaker 1>share it with other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe they can elaborate upon it </v>

132
00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:32.771
<v Speaker 1>and bring it into being with more </v>
<v Speaker 1>clarity than it would be if it merely </v>

133
00:07:32.771 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 1>existed as the precursor of a thought in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your imagination.</v>
