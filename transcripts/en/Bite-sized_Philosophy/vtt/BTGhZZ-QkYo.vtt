1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.600
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that Carl Jung said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I thought was really interesting </v>

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>when he was talking about the Oedipal </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation and families,</v>

3
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I never forgot this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the Oedipal situation,</v>

4
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:11.170
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when I'll,</v>

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll lay out the classic story is when a</v>
<v Speaker 1>child is seriously over-protected,</v>

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.800
<v Speaker 1>usually a male child by his mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the reverse can be the case and it </v>

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 1>can be a female child by the mother and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>

8
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>but I'll just talk about the classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>case to begin with.</v>

9
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Freud observed was that there were </v>

10
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.871
<v Speaker 1>usually not very good boundaries in </v>
<v Speaker 1>families like that and so the </v>

11
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:36.621
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the husband and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife was either strange or nonexistent </v>

12
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:40.610
<v Speaker 1>and the wife would often turn to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child to be what she isn't getting from </v>

13
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.991
<v Speaker 1>the husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a great south park </v>

14
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:47.721
<v Speaker 1>episode about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wonderful south park episode where </v>

15
00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:47.721
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>

16
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that horrible little </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

17
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's him.</v>

18
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

19
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his mother brings in the dog </v>

20
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>whisperer to train him and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>

21
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.320
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to learn about Freud and </v>

22
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Freud and Oedipal situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch that.</v>

23
00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>You've got it down cold because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>brings in this expert who then she wants</v>

24
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:12.351
<v Speaker 1>to have an affair with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a boundary issue and he </v>

25
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>basically separates her son from him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

26
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>and imposes the same discipline on him </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he would get impose on a bad dog.</v>

27
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Although he also trains the dogs owners </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time because maybe it's not the </v>

28
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the owner.</v>

29
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a horse whisperer movie too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the original horse whisperer.</v>

30
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>That does a beautiful job of laying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>out too because he's very good at fixing</v>

31
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:36.921
<v Speaker 1>problem horses and unbelievably good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosing psychopathology on the part </v>

32
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>of the owner.</v>

33
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>It's his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a gift for it.</v>

34
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.020
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens in this South Park episode </v>

35
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 1>is that the dog whisperer gets cartland </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

36
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Straightened out and he starts like </v>
<v Speaker 1>dressing properly and doing his homework</v>

37
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:55.941
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the mother is pursuing an affair </v>

38
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:55.941
<v Speaker 1>with the dog whisperer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's professional.</v>

39
00:01:55.941 --> 00:02:00.641
<v Speaker 1>He keeps his distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he keeps boundaries around him and </v>

40
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:04.730
<v Speaker 1>then he leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the first thing that she does </v>

41
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.981
<v Speaker 1>when he leaves his bride carton and </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically out of doing his homework so </v>

42
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>that he can accompany her to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

43
00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:11.310
<v Speaker 1>a fast food restaurant or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

44
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.550
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason she does that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she's lonesome and doesn't have </v>

45
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.550
<v Speaker 1>anybody else around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

46
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe she's also deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply,</v>

47
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 1>deeply terrified that if she helps that </v>
<v Speaker 1>boy grow up,</v>

48
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>he will leave and she'll have nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

49
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>And so mothers who don't have something </v>
<v Speaker 1>say outside their infants,</v>

50
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>not merely their children are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to fall into that.</v>

51
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>you got to think that through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lots of women really,</v>

53
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.710
<v Speaker 1>most women really fall in love with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their babies,</v>

54
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even if they start growing into </v>

55
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>larger children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be threatening because,</v>

56
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that,</v>

57
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.660
<v Speaker 1>when the child turns into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the infant turns into a toddler </v>

58
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>that the infant is dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the toddler is there now.</v>

59
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 1>And you can radically interfere with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that process.</v>

60
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>That happens all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

61
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the classic Freud in Eda pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>

62
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>And that episode is brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bloody brilliant,</v>

63
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>it just nails it and some of you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been in my personality class and watched</v>

64
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>crumb the documentary crum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's another staggering exposition</v>

65
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>of exactly that kind of pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

66
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I knew this guy once who had a mother</v>

67
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>who basically was trying that trick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she had lots of.</v>

68
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.310
<v Speaker 1>She was very smart and had lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricks up our sleeves and there's just </v>

69
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>no way he was going to go for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He rebelled at every possible moment and</v>

70
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>he basically became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

71
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 1>somewhat hypermasculine in response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a.</v>

72
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.470
<v Speaker 1>which is an interesting lesson with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to the hypermasculinity that </v>

73
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.741
<v Speaker 1>boys often develop if they're raised by </v>
<v Speaker 1>single mothers because they tend to go </v>

74
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:49.921
<v Speaker 1>one of two ways and he just thought her </v>
<v Speaker 1>at every step of the way and it didn't </v>

75
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things you said,</v>

76
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:57.961
<v Speaker 1>which I loved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can really see this in the </v>

77
00:03:57.961 --> 00:03:59.851
<v Speaker 1>chrome documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the eternal mother basically </v>

78
00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>entices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The child says,</v>

79
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal.</v>

80
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do anything but you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get to leave,</v>

81
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't leave and you don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>these difficult things,</v>

82
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>then I'll take care of you and the child</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a choice all the way along there.</v>

83
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously he's outclassed in some sense,</v>

84
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:20.911
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as obvious as you'd think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little kids are tough and they make </v>

85
00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:24.871
<v Speaker 1>decisions all the time and so Jung </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about it more as a conspiracy </v>

86
00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 1>than as something imposed on the child </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the mother and I really like.</v>

87
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a conspiracy between </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

88
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:34.051
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and child actually and I think that's a </v>

89
00:04:34.051 --> 00:04:34.051
<v Speaker 1>good way of looking at it even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really rough because said,</v>

90
00:04:34.051 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should you hold a child responsible?</v>

91
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

92
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.100
<v Speaker 1>but judiciously and not completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then if you deal with someone </v>

93
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.130
<v Speaker 1>like that as an adult and they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to escape from it,</v>

94
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to go all the way back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how the hell had happened and</v>

95
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:53.431
<v Speaker 1>then they have to adjust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to figure out where they </v>

96
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:56.580
<v Speaker 1>opened the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like inviting a vampire in because they </v>

97
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.840
<v Speaker 1>can't come in unless you invite them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.580
<v Speaker 1>so don't invite them in because once </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in,</v>

99
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>they're really hard to get rid of and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take all your blood.</v>

100
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 1>So that's a cautionary tale.</v>
