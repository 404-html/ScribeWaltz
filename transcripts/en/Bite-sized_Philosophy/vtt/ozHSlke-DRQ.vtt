1
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.430
<v Speaker 1>And they heard the voice of the Lord God</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking in the garden in the cool of the</v>

2
00:00:03.431 --> 00:00:08.431
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Adam and his wife hid themselves </v>

3
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:08.431
<v Speaker 1>from the presence of the Lord God </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst the trees of the garden.</v>

4
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:11.560
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the implication?</v>

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Priority being woken up prior to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing nakedness and vulnerability.</v>

6
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>There is no reason for God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for man and woman to hide from God now </v>

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.410
<v Speaker 1>where they're hurting from God while </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're naked,</v>

8
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.360
<v Speaker 1>they're vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

9
00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:27.400
<v Speaker 1>so think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about this.</v>

10
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like imagine that you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to live truthfully and </v>

11
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:37.591
<v Speaker 1>courageously and forthrightly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just imagine that and then imagine why </v>

12
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>you might not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then imagined.</v>

13
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about fear and shame?</v>

14
00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:42.010
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would that work?</v>

15
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that the idea of living </v>

16
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.401
<v Speaker 1>forthright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee and truthfully and courageously is </v>

17
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:53.551
<v Speaker 1>analogous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given what we already know about these </v>

18
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:55.621
<v Speaker 1>stories to walking with God in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden or what stops people from doing </v>

19
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:55.621
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

20
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:56.440
<v Speaker 1>What stops people from hiding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

21
00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:58.990
<v Speaker 1>it's their own rates and recognition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own inadequacy.</v>

22
00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:03.220
<v Speaker 1>They look at themselves and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how in the world is a creature such as?</v>

23
00:01:03.221 --> 00:01:08.221
<v Speaker 1>I supposed to live properly in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>world with everything that's wrong with </v>

24
00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.690
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what do you hide from?</v>

25
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

26
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 1>you go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit on your bed for five minutes and</v>

27
00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have you hidden from in your life?</v>

28
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have books of knowledge reveal </v>

29
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 1>themselves to you in your imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

30
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

31
00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:23.140
<v Speaker 1>why are you hiding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:01:23.141 --> 00:01:24.490
<v Speaker 1>it's no bloody wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hiding.</v>

33
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>It's no wonder that people hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that's so terrifying </v>

34
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.520
<v Speaker 1>about this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We woke up and we thought,</v>

35
00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:35.521
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this place like this is </v>

36
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:37.591
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some serious trouble here and </v>

37
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:37.591
<v Speaker 1>we're in some serious trouble and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not what we could be,</v>

38
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 1>and so we hide and that's what the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>says.</v>

39
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.580
<v Speaker 1>People woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they became self conscious.</v>

40
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.340
<v Speaker 1>They recognize their own vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that make the,</v>

41
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.210
<v Speaker 1>made them hide from manifesting their </v>
<v Speaker 1>divine destiny.</v>

42
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

43
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Lord go there.</v>

44
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I love this part of the story and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so funny and the Lord God called and we </v>

45
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.051
<v Speaker 1>could use a little humor at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Lord God called Unto Adam and </v>

46
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:03.940
<v Speaker 1>said unto him where Art Thou?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Adam said,</v>

47
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I heard a voice in the garden and I f I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was afraid because I was naked.</v>

48
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>So in case there was any doubt about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

49
00:02:11.891 --> 00:02:16.891
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hid myself and God said,</v>

50
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.590
<v Speaker 1>who told you that you were naked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you eat of the tree whereof I </v>

51
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.501
<v Speaker 1>commanded you that you should not eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is where Adam shows himself in </v>

52
00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 1>all his post fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroic glory.</v>

53
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>And the man said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman</v>

54
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>who no gave us to be with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she gave me of the tree and I did eat.</v>

55
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.460
<v Speaker 1>So that set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that set that it's so,</v>

56
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

57
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a modern feminist interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the story of Adam and eve that makes </v>

58
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.181
<v Speaker 1>the claim that eve was portrayed as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal bad guy of humanity for </v>

59
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>disobeying God and eating the Apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

60
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.840
<v Speaker 1>it looks like she slipped up and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>she tempted her husband and you know,</v>

62
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.450
<v Speaker 1>that makes her even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he's was foolish enough to </v>

63
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.260
<v Speaker 1>immediately eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it just means she was a little more </v>

64
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.260
<v Speaker 1>courageous than him then got there </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

65
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's Adam who comes across as really</v>
<v Speaker 1>one sad creature in this story as far as</v>

66
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he manages in one sentence.</v>

67
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

68
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:38.300
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the woman and said,</v>

69
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>can even blames God.</v>

70
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.000
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

71
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.160
<v Speaker 1>it was that woman and you gave her to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she gave me of the tree and I did </v>

72
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:49.280
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

73
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.300
<v Speaker 1>so hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam was all innocent except now he's </v>

74
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.820
<v Speaker 1>not only is he naked and disobedient and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardly and ashamed.</v>

75
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.950
<v Speaker 1>He's also sniffily backbiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think he writes her out like the second </v>

76
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>he gets the opportunity and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>blames God.</v>

77
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly right.</v>

78
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

79
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.100
<v Speaker 1>You go online and you read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read the commentary that men write </v>

80
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>about women when they're resentful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter about women.</v>

81
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>You read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting.</v>

82
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not me,</v>

83
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>it's those bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

84
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not me,</v>

85
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 1>it's them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

86
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>what a bloody world this is in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>they exist.</v>

87
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.250
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same thing and it is </v>

88
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.380
<v Speaker 1>absolutely pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

89
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
