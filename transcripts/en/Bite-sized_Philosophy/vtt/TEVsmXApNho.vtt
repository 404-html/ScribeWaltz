1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Now this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baboon here who's supposed to be </v>

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:05.760
<v Speaker 1>basically just a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the story was first written,</v>

3
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:10.761
<v Speaker 1>he turned into what's essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaman across time and so he represents </v>

4
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:15.441
<v Speaker 1>the self from the union perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the self is everything you could be </v>

5
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:19.611
<v Speaker 1>across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine that there's you and there's </v>

6
00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:22.611
<v Speaker 1>the potential inside you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that is and potential is an </v>

7
00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>interesting idea because it's represents</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that isn't yet real.</v>

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Yet we act like it's real because people</v>
<v Speaker 1>will say to you,</v>

9
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:33.081
<v Speaker 1>you should live up to your potential and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that potential is partly what you could </v>

10
00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:37.281
<v Speaker 1>be if you interacted with the world in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>manner that would gain you the most </v>

11
00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Because you build yourself out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information in the piagetian sense,</v>

13
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's deeper than that too because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that if you take yourself and you </v>

14
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.851
<v Speaker 1>put yourself in a new environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new genes turned on in your nervous </v>

15
00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:53.391
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they encode for new proteins and so </v>

16
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:53.391
<v Speaker 1>you're full of biological potential.</v>

17
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:58.340
<v Speaker 1>That won't be realized unless you move </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself around in the world into </v>

18
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>different challenging circumstances and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll turn on different circuits.</v>

19
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.140
<v Speaker 1>So it's not merely that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporating information from the </v>

20
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.140
<v Speaker 1>outside world in the constructivist </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

21
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>it's that by exposing yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>different environments,</v>

22
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:13.641
<v Speaker 1>you put different physiological demands </v>
<v Speaker 1>on yourself all the way down to the </v>

23
00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>genetic level and that manifests new </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of you.</v>

24
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that happens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

25
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>and this is a very common cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion,</v>

26
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.260
<v Speaker 1>is that you should go on a pilgrimage at</v>
<v Speaker 1>some point to somewhere central in that </v>

27
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.521
<v Speaker 1>would be say like the rock pride rock in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion king because you take yourself </v>

28
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:36.141
<v Speaker 1>out of your dopey little village and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just the little bounded you that </v>

29
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows and that isn't very </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanded.</v>

30
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 1>And then you go somewhere dark and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous to the central place and while</v>

31
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have adventures and they toughen you</v>

32
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>and pull more out of you.</v>

33
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Like partly because you're becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>informed,</v>

34
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>which means information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you're becoming more organized </v>

35
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>at every level of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also more of you too.</v>

36
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a very classic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in in cathedrals in Europe,</v>

37
00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>especially at charter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big maze on the floor,</v>

38
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:06.771
<v Speaker 1>a circular maize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a symbolic representation of </v>

39
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>the pilgrimage for people who couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

40
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.870
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a huge circle divided into </v>
<v Speaker 1>quadrants,</v>

41
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>which is a union Mandela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you enter the maize at one point and</v>

42
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 1>then you have to walk through the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>maze north,</v>

43
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>

44
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>and south before you get to the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the center is symbolized by a flower</v>

45
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>that's carved in stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like this.</v>

46
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.070
<v Speaker 1>It's big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This maze,</v>

47
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's large so that you can walk it.</v>

48
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's a symbolic pilgrimage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes you to the center.</v>

49
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the center of the cross because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in a cathedral.</v>

50
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's the point of acceptance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of voluntary suffering.</v>

51
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you walk through,</v>

52
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>you can call that a circum ambulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to all the corridors of the world</v>

53
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:48.250
<v Speaker 1>to find yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so while the self is,</v>

54
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.800
<v Speaker 1>is the baboon in this particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this pr,</v>

55
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a mandrill actually in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular representation.</v>

56
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>And he lives in the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lives in the tree of life.</v>

57
00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:01.911
<v Speaker 1>It's a bail bab tree in this particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the spirit that inhabits the tree of </v>

58
00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>life and he's the eternal wise man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a way of thinking,</v>

59
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:06.780
<v Speaker 1>so is the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's.</v>

60
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>He's sort of a superordinate king or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside king in some sense.</v>

61
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>He's the repository of ancient wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the king is the manner in which that</v>

62
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>wisdom is currently being acted out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and so their friends,</v>

63
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>and that means that the king is a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>king because if they,</v>

64
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.330
<v Speaker 1>if the king was a bad king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would be alienated from himself and </v>

65
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.881
<v Speaker 1>that would make him shallow and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional and that would make him a </v>

66
00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:29.881
<v Speaker 1>bad ruler.</v>

67
00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>No union with the traditions of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

68
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.660
<v Speaker 1>To be a good ruler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to rescue your father from the </v>

69
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.751
<v Speaker 1>underworld and integrate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course that's a main theme in </v>

70
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:39.751
<v Speaker 1>this entire movie.</v>
