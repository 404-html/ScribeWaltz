1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then Japan,</v>

2
00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:03.050
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows up and he's a kindly old guy,</v>

3
00:00:03.051 --> 00:00:05.660
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much exactly what you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect and you know,</v>

4
00:00:05.661 --> 00:00:10.661
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a careful craftsman and he likes </v>

5
00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:12.611
<v Speaker 1>kittens and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always a good thing and he has </v>

6
00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:17.561
<v Speaker 1>some fish and I know he's and he's good </v>
<v Speaker 1>at making things and he's got a sense of</v>

7
00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:19.640
<v Speaker 1>humor and he's kind of playful and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

8
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.080
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a good father.</v>

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the wise king.</v>

10
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.910
<v Speaker 1>He's the positive archetype of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>

11
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what he is and so he's culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's positive manifestation and he </v>

12
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 1>gives rise to this creation which is his</v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet,</v>

13
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>which is what culture does because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a puppet of your culture.</v>

14
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:41.321
<v Speaker 1>You're a Marionette of your culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so maybe you could be more than </v>

15
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:41.321
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

16
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's the other thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange about this movie and it's </v>

17
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.691
<v Speaker 1>strange about the mythological way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world because </v>

18
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:52.371
<v Speaker 1>scientifically deterministically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nature and there's culture and </v>

19
00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>you are the deterministic product of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction between nature and culture.</v>

20
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.750
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing else to you than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that.</v>

21
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>But the mythological world doesn't say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

22
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:08.481
<v Speaker 1>It says something different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says that there's nature and culture </v>

23
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:12.260
<v Speaker 1>and then there's you and the you that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there has choices and the destiny and</v>

24
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:19.161
<v Speaker 1>that you actually affect the interplay </v>
<v Speaker 1>of nature and culture in determining </v>

25
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:22.761
<v Speaker 1>your own character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it insists upon that the oldest </v>

26
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:26.451
<v Speaker 1>stories we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the hero and the </v>

27
00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 1>archetypal mother and the archetype </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

28
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>There's always those three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never just two.</v>

29
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.940
<v Speaker 1>So from the narrative perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the implication that </v>

30
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.681
<v Speaker 1>there is something autonomous about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero of the story and you know,</v>

31
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>you can't account for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a good way of accounting </v>

32
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 1>for that from a scientific perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having a discussion with Sam </v>

33
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Harris the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was very,</v>

34
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

35
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.480
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said we got wrapped around an axle,</v>

36
00:01:56.481 --> 00:01:59.540
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris is one of the four famous,</v>

37
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:02.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheists along with Christopher Hitchens</v>

38
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:06.860
<v Speaker 1>and Richard Dawkins and Dan Dennett.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 1>And so we were having a discussion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.350
<v Speaker 1>he's a determinist just right down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom.</v>

41
00:02:12.351 --> 00:02:14.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're determined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're determined.</v>

42
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:19.691
<v Speaker 1>There's no freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a deterministic machine and you </v>

43
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:20.960
<v Speaker 1>know if you're a coherent scientist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a Newtonian,</v>

44
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really have much choice other </v>

45
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.541
<v Speaker 1>than to think that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't how it seems to people </v>

46
00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:32.140
<v Speaker 1>and we don't treat each other that way </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our entire legal system is </v>

47
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.100
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that you do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact have freewill,</v>

48
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.380
<v Speaker 1>so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we account for it?</v>

49
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

50
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.410
<v Speaker 1>and do we have a scientific model for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

51
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I would also say we do not have</v>

52
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:44.030
<v Speaker 1>a scientific model for consciousness.</v>

53
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.730
<v Speaker 1>We don't know a damn thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

54
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 1>which is why Dan Dan book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was called consciousness </v>

55
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 1>explained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was referred to.</v>

56
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.250
<v Speaker 1>It's by it's critics as consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>explained a way,</v>

57
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly right as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned because he took a mechanistic </v>

58
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.530
<v Speaker 1>and I just don't think you get to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because there's something really </v>

59
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>weird about consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the phenomenologists Heidegger,</v>

60
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>who tried to radically transform western</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy right from the bottom up.</v>

61
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>He basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

62
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can treat the world as if </v>

63
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is primary and that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience is reality.</v>

64
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:25.201
<v Speaker 1>That's reality and that he doesn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>independently of consciousness in any </v>

65
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>explicable way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

66
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's out there?</v>

67
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>If there's nothing to to experience it </v>
<v Speaker 1>while everything at once.</v>

68
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

69
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not really comprehensible as </v>
<v Speaker 1>without a subject that subject defines </v>

70
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>it and makes it real.</v>

71
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't have to believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

72
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.740
<v Speaker 1>but at least I'm telling you that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are thoroughly coherent philosophical </v>

73
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:51.181
<v Speaker 1>positions that make that case very </v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly and that that allow </v>

74
00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:56.161
<v Speaker 1>consciousness to exist as a phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to take it seriously and you </v>

75
00:03:56.161 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>certainly act like you take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

76
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:02.131
<v Speaker 1>You Act like there's a you and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>make choices and you certainly treat </v>

77
00:04:02.131 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 1>other people that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deterministic or not,</v>

78
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:09.271
<v Speaker 1>you're still going to get angry when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're being rude to you and you're </v>

79
00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>going to act as if they had some choice </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the matter.</v>

80
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's an illusion possibly,</v>

81
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.220
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say the oldest stories that </v>

82
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>we have always include that as not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a fundamental element,</v>

83
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 1>but even as the fundamental element.</v>
