1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>So Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talking about this idea of ending </v>

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.420
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary suffering and this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>committing one's life to that at a </v>

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.220
<v Speaker 1>minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the minimum thing that you</v>

4
00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:12.350
<v Speaker 1>could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of students,</v>

5
00:00:12.351 --> 00:00:17.351
<v Speaker 1>I think accept that premise and view </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing as trying to </v>

6
00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:21.200
<v Speaker 1>eliminate or reduce unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and they see activism or other</v>

7
00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:23.900
<v Speaker 1>forms of direct service as fulfilling </v>
<v Speaker 1>that goal.</v>

8
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Do you simply disagree with like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>content of what they think the tactic </v>

9
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.040
<v Speaker 1>that they are using to end unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering?</v>

10
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Or do you think that their motives or </v>
<v Speaker 1>their intentions are not even the same </v>

11
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>as yours</v>

12
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.660
<v Speaker 1>to public?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this old saying from the,</v>

14
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.160
<v Speaker 1>from the new testament about not praying</v>
<v Speaker 1>in public.</v>

15
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that if you're going to </v>

16
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.221
<v Speaker 1>commune for the higher good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do it in private because </v>

17
00:00:57.221 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you're warping your ethic in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense by demonstrating how virtuous</v>

18
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>you virtuous you are to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

19
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go out there with a stick and a sign</v>

20
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:05.330
<v Speaker 1>on it that says I'm against poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

21
00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:06.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no kidding.</v>

22
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>That's really like for poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty,</v>

23
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

24
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.260
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an abdication of responsibility </v>

25
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>with the mask of social virtue and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to solve difficult problems.</v>

26
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.810
<v Speaker 1>You've figured out how to get along with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brother,</v>

27
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:22.460
<v Speaker 1>the one you've been fighting with for </v>
<v Speaker 1>five years,</v>

28
00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:24.890
<v Speaker 1>or see if you can staple your family </v>
<v Speaker 1>back together,</v>

29
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.950
<v Speaker 1>see if you can stop fighting with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend and have a relationship that </v>

30
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.950
<v Speaker 1>lasts for more than two weeks.</v>

31
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there are things that you </v>

32
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.090
<v Speaker 1>should be doing in the confines of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own life that are private and humble,</v>

33
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.950
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

34
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.960
<v Speaker 1>that would constitute genuine </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments and those are the things</v>

35
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:41.150
<v Speaker 1>that you should attend to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no one's gonna come along and say,</v>

36
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.020
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.970
<v Speaker 1>good job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

38
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.950
<v Speaker 1>you're changing the world because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>private,</v>

39
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's real and people don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so no,</v>

40
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust the activist.</v>

41
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust the activist ethos at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

42
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I think everything about it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is superficial and,</v>

43
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>and trendy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and too easy.</v>

44
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.460
<v Speaker 1>And and at the externalizes the blame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evil is always elsewhere,</v>

45
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>which is a dreadful mistake to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the evil isn't elsewhere.</v>

46
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:18.821
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that you understand </v>

47
00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 1>when you're wise is the evil is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere,</v>

48
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.160
<v Speaker 1>it's you because you're not everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be.</v>

49
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.650
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should work on that before going in </v>

50
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.650
<v Speaker 1>and telling someone else that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not who they should be.</v>

51
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.960
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>so I don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too easy.</v>

53
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.440
<v Speaker 1>It's far too easy and it's too public </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's too self congratulatory.</v>

54
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.750
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the murderous like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxist element,</v>

55
00:02:38.751 --> 00:02:41.330
<v Speaker 1>which I'm always often inclined to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mention.</v>

56
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>So certainly I think you've identified </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain causes where the public element </v>

57
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.710
<v Speaker 1>or the self congratulatory time to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

58
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Could it be harmful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you think there are cases,</v>

59
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:59.531
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of policy influencing </v>

60
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:01.871
<v Speaker 1>policy and being a policymaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems something like that public </v>

61
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:05.581
<v Speaker 1>policy could be used to eliminate some </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary suffering but would involve </v>

62
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:12.121
<v Speaker 1>a more public domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something where you are trying to </v>

63
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:14.851
<v Speaker 1>attract followers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to attract praise from other </v>

64
00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:14.851
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

65
00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've established yourself in the </v>

66
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.571
<v Speaker 1>world as a credible human being and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are asking you to enter public </v>

67
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:26.540
<v Speaker 1>service because of your accomplishments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's time to do it right,</v>

68
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.250
<v Speaker 1>but before that it's a little on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>premature side and if you're just </v>

69
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 1>setting your for self forward as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Avatar of an idea of an ideology,</v>

70
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>then there's nothing to you except I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of it as the chattering of various</v>

71
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>forms of demons.</v>

72
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're not helpful and if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look,</v>

73
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>you want to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

74
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>are you fit to lead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

75
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

76
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know where you're going?</v>

77
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Because that's actually one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallmarks of a leader.</v>

78
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Leader knows where he's going and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people are also interested in </v>

79
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.421
<v Speaker 1>going that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the leaders I've met have carved </v>

80
00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:00.421
<v Speaker 1>themselves out a personal vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

81
00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:05.371
<v Speaker 1>It's not some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not some cookie cutter ideological </v>

82
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:07.510
<v Speaker 1>solution to the ills of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done a detailed analysis,</v>

83
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know what they're talking about and</v>

84
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:10.710
<v Speaker 1>they're usually people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

85
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>they've had a successful relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had a successful family,</v>

86
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.900
<v Speaker 1>they have a couple of degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've established a business like </v>

87
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>they've made themselves credible in five</v>
<v Speaker 1>or six dimensions.</v>

88
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Well then maybe you know enough about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world to dare to mess with its </v>

89
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.651
<v Speaker 1>internal mechanisms and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have that kind of in depth </v>

90
00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:28.651
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should.</v>

91
00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should know more work on the </v>

92
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>economic systems of Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

93
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Then you should try to adjust the </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic systems of your automobile </v>

94
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 1>because the latter is far less complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the former.</v>

95
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>So of course there's utility in policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulation and in,</v>

96
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.220
<v Speaker 1>in government service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of those sorts of things.</v>

97
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 1>But you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have transformed yourself at</v>

98
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:56.911
<v Speaker 1>least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into someone who's actually competent </v>

99
00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:56.911
<v Speaker 1>before you should even dare to do such </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

100
00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

101
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.470
<v Speaker 1>I have read some marks and now I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to change the world.</v>

102
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 1>That that's a very bad idea because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that you're going to take </v>

103
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.901
<v Speaker 1>something complex that doesn't work too </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly and fix it with your idiotic </v>

104
00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:12.660
<v Speaker 1>intervention is zero.</v>

105
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well put.</v>
