1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>He and I had another client who could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>lucid in her dreams,</v>

2
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:09.951
<v Speaker 1>which is more common among women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She could ask the damn characters what </v>

3
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 1>they represented and they would tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

4
00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:17.091
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like a lot of the things they told </v>

6
00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>her were really helpful and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>not things that she wanted to hear.</v>

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she basically,</v>

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 1>one of them told her she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she was going to live,</v>

9
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.330
<v Speaker 1>she'd have to go visit a slaughterhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that was because she </v>

10
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:34.401
<v Speaker 1>was raised as a little princess and </v>
<v Speaker 1>protected from horrible mother nature </v>

11
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>until she hit puberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which time she turned into an evil </v>

12
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.220
<v Speaker 1>villain because that's how the family </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

13
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Perfect child evil teenager overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

14
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.190
<v Speaker 1>well that was hard on her and she wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared because she thought the world </v>

15
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>was princess world and she couldn't go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a butcher store without having a</v>

16
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>fit.</v>

17
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>And no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>like really Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder,</v>

19
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>but you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she couldn't.</v>

20
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>So we used to go to butcher stores and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make her cry.</v>

21
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

22
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>she was a vegetarian that would make her</v>
<v Speaker 1>cry and it will be mon the cruelty of </v>

23
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

24
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough,</v>

25
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are bloody slabs of meat.</v>

26
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:17.121
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why everyone isn't </v>

27
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:17.121
<v Speaker 1>screaming when they walked through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>butcher store,</v>

28
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:21.440
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta get used to it band </v>

29
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.440
<v Speaker 1>because you can't live in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise.</v>

30
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.331
<v Speaker 1>And so the dream character who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gypsy told her that she had to go visit </v>

31
00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>a slaughterhouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seemed rather impractical.</v>

32
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.540
<v Speaker 1>And so I asked her if she could think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else to do and she thought,</v>

33
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we go visit a funeral home </v>

34
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and watch an embalming?</v>

35
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh good,</v>

36
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>that sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like a fun way to spend a </v>

37
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.131
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I phoned up a funeral parlor and </v>

38
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I declined.</v>

39
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.110
<v Speaker 1>It was terrified of death now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was a therapist who was also a </v>

40
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>little shaky on the concept myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

41
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>they had no problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They deal with death all the time,</v>

42
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>which is really something to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

43
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:05.841
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A human being can actually have an </v>

44
00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:07.911
<v Speaker 1>occupation where they do nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with death and they don't go stark </v>

45
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>raving mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

46
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:14.151
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like working in a palliative care </v>

47
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>ward where your clients that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

48
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>all they're going to do is die this </v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

49
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the week after.</v>

50
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>People do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like those people are tough man.</v>

51
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>They're tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

52
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>we went and watched this embalming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

53
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I have a rather high level of disgust </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity.</v>

54
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>So it was a little on the rough side for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

55
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>But she sat there and first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well she was not,</v>

56
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>we were outside this little room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was not looking at that man no way.</v>

57
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.860
<v Speaker 1>And she'd kind of go like this and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

58
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she'd go like this and then she</v>

59
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:54.891
<v Speaker 1>go like this and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she watched it and then she asked if</v>

60
00:02:55.171 --> 00:03:00.171
<v Speaker 1>she could go in and she put on a glove </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she touched the body and she didn't </v>

61
00:03:00.171 --> 00:03:04.230
<v Speaker 1>a fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't have a panic attack and so </v>

62
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.231
<v Speaker 1>she walked away from their learning that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a hell of a lot more to her </v>

63
00:03:07.231 --> 00:03:11.041
<v Speaker 1>than she thought there was and that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>could see things that she didn't think </v>

64
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:13.951
<v Speaker 1>she could see and live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and after that she sort of had a </v>

65
00:03:13.951 --> 00:03:13.951
<v Speaker 1>touchstone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

66
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of afraid of this.</v>

67
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it as bad as going to see the </v>

68
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.550
<v Speaker 1>bombing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

69
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.550
<v Speaker 1>it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>I guess I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an initiation,</v>

71
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had an initiation and so did I.</v>

72
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I learned a lot from doing that.</v>

73
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I learned that one of the things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to do if you're going to be a human</v>

74
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>being is to prepare yourself to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful in the face of death.</v>

75
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And so when you have a parent that dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shatters people's ideas,</v>

76
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>often they can't even think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't even think about that,</v>

77
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.240
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got some thinking to do because </v>

78
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>you need to be able to at least think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that because otherwise you're just</v>

79
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>going to be a wasteland when it happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you never know.</v>

80
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:58.531
<v Speaker 1>You could even have a higher ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could even be useful when it </v>

81
00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:02.551
<v Speaker 1>happens instead of being part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heap of destroyed people who also have </v>

82
00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 1>to be taken care of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:09.181
<v Speaker 1>and that's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be brutal to be useful in </v>

84
00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>the aftermath of your parents' death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

85
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:13.490
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to crumble and fall apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>and no,</v>

86
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you have every reason to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got to be kind of some tough </v>

87
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>monster to manage that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you want to be useful in the face of</v>

88
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 1>tragedy or do you want to be pathetic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

89
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>you make your choice.</v>
