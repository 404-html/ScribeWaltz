00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.550
<v Speaker 1>The good estimates are that the Russians</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed about 30 million of their own </v>

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.280
<v Speaker 1>people between 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 in 1959,</v>

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.200
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brutal.</v>

5
00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:15.250
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that was through starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.570
<v Speaker 1>I saw a photograph the other day which I</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted,</v>

7
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:22.571
<v Speaker 1>which is the worst photograph I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen in my life and that's actually </v>

8
00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:24.590
<v Speaker 1>saying a lot because I've seen a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>really terrible photographs because I've</v>

9
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.100
<v Speaker 1>done so much investigation into </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism and this was a </v>

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.671
<v Speaker 1>photograph that was taken during one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the early starvation periods in,</v>

11
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.310
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union were about $3 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion peasants died.</v>

12
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.490
<v Speaker 1>It was a picture of a peasant couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing behind a table at a market </v>

13
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>selling human body parts for food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.090
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this weird quirk,</v>

15
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.530
<v Speaker 1>which I don't think does me much good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe helps me understand things </v>

16
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>better when I see that someone has done </v>
<v Speaker 1>something extreme.</v>

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.090
<v Speaker 1>I learned to do this a long time ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I worked briefly in a maximum </v>

18
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.361
<v Speaker 1>security prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to imagine what I would have to </v>

19
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:11.921
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of situation I would have to </v>

20
00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:12.860
<v Speaker 1>find myself and to do that and believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

21
00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:14.630
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a horrifying enter.</v>

22
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 1>That's a horrifying enterprise because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is actually possible.</v>

23
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.920
<v Speaker 1>No matter what it is that you read about</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone doing and no matter how unlikely</v>

24
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:28.961
<v Speaker 1>it is that you think you would do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible to imagine yourself in </v>

25
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:31.370
<v Speaker 1>that situation</v>

26
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>

27
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's enlightening.</v>

28
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's enlightening.</v>

29
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things about </v>

30
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.901
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment is is that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened by doing things that are </v>

31
00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>necessary that you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

32
00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 1>really do not want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to do.</v>

33
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>And imagining imagining yourself as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetrator of that sort is that tells </v>

34
00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:01.780
<v Speaker 1>you something about the world and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells you something about human beings.</v>

35
00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:05.830
<v Speaker 1>But it's a hell of a thing to swallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

36
00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:10.831
<v Speaker 1>and in a very well structured society </v>
<v Speaker 1>like ours where were so peaceful.</v>

37
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we have the heat and it always </v>

38
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.910
<v Speaker 1>works and we have electricity and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>always works.</v>

39
00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 1>And we have plumbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bloody miracle,</v>

40
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 1>and it always works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:29.311
<v Speaker 1>it's just one of the things that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination process has done for me is </v>

42
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.640
<v Speaker 1>keep me alert</v>

43
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.490
<v Speaker 1>to the absolute miracle that my life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

44
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.360
<v Speaker 1>It's horribly cold out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't grow any food.</v>

45
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.750
<v Speaker 1>You die if you're out there for 24 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

46
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.550
<v Speaker 1>If any of this infrastructure was </v>
<v Speaker 1>unreliable for any length of time,</v>

47
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:53.480
<v Speaker 1>we would be in serious trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's never unreliable.</v>

48
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.170
<v Speaker 1>It's so unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here we are with all this </v>

49
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>reliable infrastructure and because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

50
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>we don't really have to compete with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other much.</v>

51
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some you don't compete for food,</v>

52
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't compete for shelter or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do,</v>

53
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>but not very many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really easy to think of yourself</v>

54
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:18.031
<v Speaker 1>as good because you're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything nasty to anyone.</v>

55
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cynic might say,</v>

56
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>well that's just because you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>any reason to.</v>

57
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>But those reasons have arisen many times</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past.</v>

58
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>And in fact they're the norm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the exception.</v>

59
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.340
<v Speaker 1>We're the exception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this insanely functional society that </v>

60
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.490
<v Speaker 1>we've somehow managed to generate is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incomprehensible to me that it </v>

61
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>
