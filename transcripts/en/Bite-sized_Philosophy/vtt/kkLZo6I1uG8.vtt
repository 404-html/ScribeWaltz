1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.800
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pure narcissism at work,</v>

2
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:13.681
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to hijack hijacking event</v>

3
00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:32.071
<v Speaker 1>like this and other people put time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort into and to use the civility of </v>

4
00:01:33.881 --> 00:01:38.881
<v Speaker 1>the crowd and the civility of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizers as an excuse to blatantly </v>

5
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:43.801
<v Speaker 1>yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're ill informed opinions is no way </v>

6
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:44.260
<v Speaker 1>to conduct a civil dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely appalling.</v>

7
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.850
<v Speaker 1>The people who do that should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed.</v>

8
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

9
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also say that as students and as</v>

10
00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>faculty members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't put up with it.</v>

11
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>There is no way that you should allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are doing this to hijack your</v>

12
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:11.211
<v Speaker 1>educational opportunities and to bend </v>
<v Speaker 1>and twist the functions and the </v>

13
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 1>structures of the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing.</v>

14
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Not In any way at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that was a very disgraceful </v>

15
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>display fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's stick with it.</v>

16
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think people are afraid of </v>

17
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>free speech?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people develop an ideological view of </v>

19
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.641
<v Speaker 1>the world because they don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think through things in real detail and </v>

20
00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:41.060
<v Speaker 1>they're aided and embedded in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>endeavor by their pathological </v>

21
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>professors who are feeding them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would I say?</v>

22
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Oversimplified an oversimplified radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>view of the world,</v>

23
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fundamentally based in,</v>

24
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>in resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that there's no reason for say,</v>

25
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>a left wing view of the world and we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to that later.</v>

26
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>It's easy virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.220
<v Speaker 1>you can stand up in front of 900 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your art and your and your </v>

28
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.691
<v Speaker 1>screeching and you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can declaim to the entire audience </v>

29
00:03:09.691 --> 00:03:13.381
<v Speaker 1>your fundamental moral superiority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell everyone at once that </v>

30
00:03:13.381 --> 00:03:17.551
<v Speaker 1>they're all beneath you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing for the right thing and </v>

31
00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>absolutely none of that is earned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

33
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.040
<v Speaker 1>What the hell was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

34
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>it's come seriously man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>

35
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:27.571
<v Speaker 1>it's just complete misbehavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's embarrassing and the fact that the </v>

36
00:03:27.571 --> 00:03:31.501
<v Speaker 1>people who do that don't have enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to go hide their head in shame </v>

37
00:03:31.501 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>just tells you how badly socialize they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and how terribly educated they are.</v>

38
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.790
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's so awful is that there </v>

39
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.790
<v Speaker 1>are professors and educators who promote</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and say,</v>

40
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you change the world.</v>

41
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like it is how you change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

42
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly not how you make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

43
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>You make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly,</v>

44
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no comfort in that and there's </v>

45
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.970
<v Speaker 1>nothing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Impressive.</v>

46
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.680
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no better in some sense than a two </v>

47
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>year old having a tantrum on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows,</v>

48
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.350
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it approximately the same level of </v>

49
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.261
<v Speaker 1>psychosocial development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the fact that this is happening </v>

50
00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 1>continually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities is,</v>

51
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it truly makes me embarrassed to be </v>

52
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.781
<v Speaker 1>associated with the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I say that with great </v>

53
00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 1>displeasure because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:18.241
<v Speaker 1>I've been working for great universities</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a very long time and the university </v>

55
00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>is an absolutely remarkable institution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>it's survived for a thousand years and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to see it,</v>

57
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.380
<v Speaker 1>to see it brought down by by people </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose behavior would be out of place at </v>

58
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>a four year old's birthday party is is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something something bizible to behold.</v>
