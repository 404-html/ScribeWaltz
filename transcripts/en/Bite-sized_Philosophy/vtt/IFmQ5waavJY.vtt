1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Your attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2
00:00:01.981 --> 00:00:06.981
<v Speaker 1>is mediated by unconscious forces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that you know that perfectly </v>

3
00:00:06.981 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>well and this is another Freud and </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation.</v>

4
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>You know if you're sitting down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your conscious intent is to study,</v>

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>but you know perfectly well that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of distraction fantasies are going</v>

7
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:25.431
<v Speaker 1>to enter the theater of your imagination</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonstop and annoyingly and there isn't </v>

8
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>really a lot you can do about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>except maybe wait it out.</v>

9
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'll be sitting there reading and </v>

10
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.660
<v Speaker 1>your attention will flicker away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll think about maybe you want to </v>

11
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>watch Jane the Virgin on Netflix or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

12
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:41.541
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's time to have a peanut </v>
<v Speaker 1>butter sandwich or you should get the </v>

13
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.421
<v Speaker 1>dust bunnies from out from underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bed or it's time to go outside and </v>

14
00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:48.021
<v Speaker 1>have a cigarette or maybe it's time for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a cup of coffee or it's like all these </v>

15
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:51.861
<v Speaker 1>subsystems in you that would like </v>
<v Speaker 1>something aren't very happy just to sit </v>

16
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>there while you read this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually bored by and so they pop</v>

17
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>up and try to take control of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions and your actions nonstop.</v>

18
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is a stupid course anyways,</v>

19
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>why do I have to read this damn paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what am I doing in university?</v>

20
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>And what's the point of life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can really.</v>

21
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can really get going if you're </v>

22
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>trying to avoid doing your homework and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

23
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>and then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>what is it in you that's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid?</v>

25
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:20.751
<v Speaker 1>Because after all you took the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>course and you told yourself to sit </v>

26
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:26.031
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you listen well because </v>

27
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a mess.</v>

28
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically why you haven't got</v>
<v Speaker 1>control over yourself at all.</v>

29
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>And no more than I have control over </v>
<v Speaker 1>this laptop.</v>

30
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the memory function of,</v>

31
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the unconscious,</v>

32
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>and there's the disillusion of function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting one.</v>

33
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>The unconscious contains habits once </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary,</v>

34
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>now automatized and dissociated elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the personality which may lead a </v>

35
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>parasitic existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting one.</v>

36
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>I would relate that more to procedural </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>

37
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what you've done is practiced certain</v>

38
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they might be,</v>

39
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>let's call them bad habits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you like those things to get under </v>

40
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>

41
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>So maybe when you're speaking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

42
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.410
<v Speaker 1>you use like and you know and you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lot and you've practiced that so </v>

43
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 1>you're really good at it and you'd like </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop it,</v>

44
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:19.251
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get to because you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>built that little machine right into </v>

45
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>your being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

46
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 1>It's neurologically wired and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>under conscious control and anything you</v>

47
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>practice becomes that it becomes part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

48
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's another element of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

49
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:34.521
<v Speaker 1>a different part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a creative part which </v>

50
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:34.521
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:38.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting around and maybe you're </v>

52
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:40.641
<v Speaker 1>trying to write something or maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to produce a piece of art or a </v>

53
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:44.901
<v Speaker 1>piece of music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're just laying in bed </v>

54
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:44.901
<v Speaker 1>dreaming and you have all these weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

55
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:49.581
<v Speaker 1>And especially in dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like what were those things come </v>

56
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even more strange,</v>

57
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's really weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>about dreams and almost impossibly weird</v>

58
00:02:55.171 --> 00:03:00.171
<v Speaker 1>is that you're an observer in the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a dream is something that </v>

59
00:03:00.171 --> 00:03:00.171
<v Speaker 1>happens to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:03:00.171 --> 00:03:04.980
<v Speaker 1>you're dreaming it theoretically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how is it that you can be an </v>

61
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>observer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you're watching a video</v>

62
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 1>game or a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're producing it that at least in</v>

63
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although the psychoanalyst would say,</v>

64
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

65
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>not exactly.</v>

66
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Your ego isn't producing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your unconscious as producing,</v>

67
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing,</v>

68
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>and of course young would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

69
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:24.631
<v Speaker 1>it's deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The collective unconscious might be </v>

70
00:03:24.631 --> 00:03:26.851
<v Speaker 1>producing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in some sense it isn't you exactly </v>

71
00:03:26.851 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>or it isn't the you that you think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think of you,</v>

72
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>and that's the ego from the Friday and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

73
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:35.761
<v Speaker 1>the you that you identify with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the ego and outside of that is </v>

74
00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:39.841
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ID that's more of the place of </v>

75
00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:43.051
<v Speaker 1>impulses and you could think about those</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the biological subsystems that can </v>

76
00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>derail your thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

77
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:48.541
<v Speaker 1>And that govern things like hunger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex and aggression and your basic </v>

78
00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:52.500
<v Speaker 1>instincts is another way of putting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a reasonable way of thinking </v>

79
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>about it because these are subsystems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you share with with animals.</v>

80
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>You share them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly with mammals.</v>

81
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.900
<v Speaker 1>You share most of them with reptiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You share a lot of them with amphibians </v>

82
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>and even going all the way down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>crustaceans.</v>

83
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:07.171
<v Speaker 1>There's commonality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example in the dominance hierarchy </v>

84
00:04:07.171 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>circuits and so these are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old things and the idea that you're</v>

85
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>in control of them is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

86
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.450
<v Speaker 1>you're not exactly in control of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say the less integrated you </v>

87
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.531
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less you're in control of them and </v>

88
00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>the more they're in control of you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can get really out of hand.</v>

89
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be like with people who have </v>

90
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>obsessive compulsive disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

91
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

92
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be,</v>

93
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>I would say that dissoluted elements in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense of the unconscious,</v>

94
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.400
<v Speaker 1>the way that it's portrayed here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor people with obsessive compulsive </v>

95
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.061
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can spend half their time doing </v>

96
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>things that they can't really control </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have very strong impulses to do</v>

97
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

98
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 1>And it's very hard on them to block them</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

99
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll almost panic if those things are</v>

100
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:55.921
<v Speaker 1>blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have people with two Rett </v>

101
00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:55.921
<v Speaker 1>Syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:58.411
<v Speaker 1>that they'll be doing all sorts of weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>dances and spouting off obscenities and,</v>

103
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.330
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

104
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 1>and imitating people without being able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to control it.</v>

105
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:08.881
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes a little bit of anti </v>

106
00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:08.881
<v Speaker 1>psychotic medication can dampen that </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

107
00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:13.651
<v Speaker 1>But it's as if there are these </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous semi spirits inside of them </v>

108
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 1>that grip control over their behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make them do things.</v>

109
00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find that to some degree in your own</v>

110
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>life because maybe you've become very </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to someone even.</v>

111
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't want to be attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person.</v>

112
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:29.131
<v Speaker 1>And then you find yourself texting them </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know perfectly well that you </v>

113
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:29.920
<v Speaker 1>should be going to bed and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

114
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>you're in a grip of something and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't control it.</v>

115
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's all part of the unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all part of what Freud was studying.</v>
