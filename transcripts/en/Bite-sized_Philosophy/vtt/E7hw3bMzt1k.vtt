1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gomorrah,</v>

2
00:00:02.901 --> 00:00:05.030
<v Speaker 1>brimstone and fire from the Lord out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Heaven,</v>

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.840
<v Speaker 1>and he overthrew the cities and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane and all the inhabitants of the </v>

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>cities and that which grew up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>

5
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.490
<v Speaker 1>but his wife looked back from behind him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she became a pillar of salt,</v>

6
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 1>known histology for catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what that means is that </v>

7
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>when you leave what's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wash the dust off your feet and you </v>

8
00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:36.580
<v Speaker 1>don't look back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very harsh lesson.</v>

9
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.370
<v Speaker 1>This is echoed a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New Testament,</v>

10
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.570
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the necessity for immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

11
00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:49.540
<v Speaker 1>These are some of the harsher words that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ said.</v>

12
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 1>This is from Matthew Eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ is addressing a multitude and </v>

13
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.950
<v Speaker 1>asking people to follow him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a disciple comes up to him and says,</v>

14
00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:04.951
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer me first to go and bury my </v>

15
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:07.591
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like a perfectly reasonable </v>

16
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:07.591
<v Speaker 1>request,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Jesus said unto him,</v>

17
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>follow me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let the dead bury their dead.</v>

18
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.220
<v Speaker 1>This is from Matthew 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:18.430
<v Speaker 1>he had talked to the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Behold his mother and his brethren stood</v>

20
00:01:18.431 --> 00:01:21.220
<v Speaker 1>without desiring to speak with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then one said to him,</v>

21
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thy mother and I,</v>

22
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:28.171
<v Speaker 1>brethren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand without desiring to speak with </v>

23
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.361
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Jesus answered the one who was </v>

24
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:30.880
<v Speaker 1>telling him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is my mother and who is my brother's</v>

25
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>for whosoever shall do the will of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

26
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:40.881
<v Speaker 1>which is in heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as my brother and sister and </v>

27
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:40.990
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:45.991
<v Speaker 1>what does all that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that there's no excuses </v>

29
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:49.910
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever for not getting up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting out it.</v>

30
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.540
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means and it means that</v>

31
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>it even means that when people are beset</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a catastrophe,</v>

32
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>like let's say the death of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

33
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.960
<v Speaker 1>that they are prone to use that as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse for not going about the business </v>

34
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>that they should be going about because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can say to themselves,</v>

35
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would except,</v>

36
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>and except there's always good reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

37
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:20.331
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always good reasons for not </v>

38
00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:22.011
<v Speaker 1>doing what you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for sure the reasons pile up day </v>

39
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:23.360
<v Speaker 1>after day to not do what you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially cause you're,</v>

40
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at things in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put them off and definitely </v>

41
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>right because of the demands of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these stories,</v>

42
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>they say a variety of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:38.451
<v Speaker 1>and especially in combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say when you leave somewhere </v>

44
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:38.451
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not look back.</v>

45
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.580
<v Speaker 1>There's known astrologer that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the letting the dead parts of </v>

46
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>yourself go</v>

47
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.770
<v Speaker 1>and then if you're going to follow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

48
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:53.771
<v Speaker 1>there's no excuse not to do it and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it means no excuse whatsoever under any </v>

49
00:02:53.771 --> 00:02:55.700
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's taken even farther.</v>

50
00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:57.770
<v Speaker 1>With regards to familial relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

51
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>You can't even let them stand in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and I think that's all true and I </v>

52
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>think I've seen virtually all of that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my clinical practice.</v>

53
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Like there is no excuse whatsoever for </v>
<v Speaker 1>not getting at what it is that you </v>

54
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>should be doing and I think there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else that's going on here,</v>

55
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 1>especially in the new testament stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>which has even made maybe worse,</v>

56
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:26.521
<v Speaker 1>which is it's absolutely reprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 1>to justify your inaction with a </v>

57
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe that extract mercy from </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

58
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a tricky,</v>

59
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>tricky game that's going well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I can't do that.</v>

60
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Look at the terrible thing that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to me and say,</v>

61
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

62
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.300
<v Speaker 1>I understand you're absolved of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity to move forward because of </v>

63
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>your current catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

64
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually you're not,</v>

65
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.910
<v Speaker 1>and it's rather rude of you to use it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an excuse and it's certainly </v>

66
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.910
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive.</v>
