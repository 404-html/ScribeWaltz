1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.250
<v Speaker 1>To navigate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two things you need to know when</v>

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>the first is where the hell are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>

3
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:09.750
<v Speaker 1>precisely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Razor Sharp,</v>

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.080
<v Speaker 1>what's good about you and what's bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>about you by your own buy your own </v>

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.080
<v Speaker 1>reckoning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to.</v>

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>You can ask other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is a game you play yourself.</v>

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking star.</v>

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>What is it that's okay about being what </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs some work and you've got to watch </v>

9
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>to not be too self critical when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that too,</v>

10
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>because that can just be another kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>flaw and then the next is,</v>

11
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well where are you going?</v>

12
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>What's your destination?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the frame is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know you could do that in a very</v>

14
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:42.891
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated way and you do that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking consciously about who it is </v>

15
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>that you are in an articulated manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>and where you want to go and why and how</v>

16
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people hardly ever do that.</v>

17
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's come as such an absolute shock to</v>

18
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>me as an educator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

19
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>because one of the other programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use this in my classes,</v>

20
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.430
<v Speaker 1>what are the other programs in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>suite of programs is called the future </v>

21
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>authoring program and I started </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing my maps of meaning class,</v>

22
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:11.031
<v Speaker 1>which is where some of this materials </v>
<v Speaker 1>from andI got students to write about </v>

23
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:11.031
<v Speaker 1>their past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

24
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:11.050
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

25
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's tell your story.</v>

26
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Who are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how'd you get here,</v>

27
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:20.611
<v Speaker 1>and what are you now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That usually helps people put things to </v>

28
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's quite stressful.</v>

29
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it.</v>

30
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Stress goes up when you're doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you feel miserable for a couple of</v>

31
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.880
<v Speaker 1>weeks and then stress goes down and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>stays down.</v>

32
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.910
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also why people don't do it </v>

33
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.910
<v Speaker 1>because who the hell wants to have their</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress go up?</v>

34
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>But if it's temporary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a sacrifice.</v>

35
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>So then the next issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

36
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 1>where are you going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that,</v>

37
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.880
<v Speaker 1>and this I just still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot understand you.</v>

38
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Students that had been in education </v>
<v Speaker 1>system for 15 years,</v>

39
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.770
<v Speaker 1>14 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high end students.</v>

40
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not once in their whole bloody life.</v>

41
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Did anyone ever get them to sit down for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a day and say,</v>

42
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:59.820
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justify your existence.</v>

43
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Like plus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>

44
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you are in university.</v>

45
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:08.391
<v Speaker 1>You're taking a bunch of courses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got some sort of vague career </v>

46
00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like defending the damn thing a bit</v>

47
00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:12.690
<v Speaker 1>since you're going to go live it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

48
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>You're staking everything on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

49
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 1>what's your damn plan and why are you so</v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced that it's not the plan of a </v>

50
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>babbling fool because if you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about it,</v>

51
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>it is and if you really want to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and live that out,</v>

52
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.840
<v Speaker 1>you know one of the things Carl Jung </v>
<v Speaker 1>said was that you,</v>

53
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>you're in a story whether you know it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

54
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>and then he made two nice comments about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

55
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.890
<v Speaker 1>If it's someone else's story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably going to get a bit part </v>

56
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>and it might not be the one you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it's a story that you don't know,</v>

57
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:50.241
<v Speaker 1>it might be one with a really bad ending</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's just bad period with a </v>

58
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:54.441
<v Speaker 1>worse ending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't know what the story </v>

59
00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>that you're living out is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's the one you know.</v>

60
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you got that from your mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got it from your grandmother,</v>

61
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:03.111
<v Speaker 1>you got it from your or God only knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you picked it up because you pick </v>

62
00:03:03.111 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>up things like mad because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are like.</v>

63
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.660
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you're living a malevolent </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy unconsciously and then one thing</v>

64
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>you might ask yourself is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

65
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>how wretched and miserable is your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>

66
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>few title to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how wretched,</v>

67
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>miserable and futile is your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

68
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 percent on each count.</v>

69
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're probably unconsciously </v>

70
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>living out a malevolent tragedy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's not for the best.</v>

71
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's either that or the whole universe </v>

72
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.800
<v Speaker 1>hates you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Or 70 percent hates you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

75
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:41.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got students to start writing in </v>

76
00:03:41.671 --> 00:03:45.961
<v Speaker 1>detail about not what they wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a career thing because that's </v>

77
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 1>the closest people usually get is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a career plan.</v>

78
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:49.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

79
00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a career plan.</v>

80
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's peripheral important.</v>

81
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>But peripheral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

82
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got three years,</v>

83
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to live them anyways.</v>

84
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Devote those three years to setting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world up around you so that it's the </v>

85
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.741
<v Speaker 1>best it can possibly be for you as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were taking care of yourself as if </v>

86
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>you cared for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what would that look like?</v>

87
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say just for the sake of argument,</v>

88
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>if you figured out where you were that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have,</v>

89
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 1>what would be best for you?</v>

90
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

91
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I bet you never asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't ask and so life comes out </v>

92
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:32.911
<v Speaker 1>them like random snakes and they sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fend them off and life goes by and </v>

93
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>things don't work out the way people </v>
<v Speaker 1>expected them to.</v>

94
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
<v Speaker 1>But a huge part of that is they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know where they were because they </v>

95
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.871
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't look or didn't know that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should look ignorance and willful </v>

96
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to great catastrophes,</v>

97
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 1>and they never figured out where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted it to go or why.</v>

98
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a problem with figuring out </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you want to go.</v>

99
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is is that you make your</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions for failure clear to yourself</v>

100
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 1>and people don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you keep yourself in the fog,</v>

101
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.560
<v Speaker 1>then you can't tell when you screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that isn't so good because you're </v>

102
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.311
<v Speaker 1>still screwing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just to blind self blind to </v>

103
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:11.311
<v Speaker 1>notice.</v>

104
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Although in in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the short term that's less painful.</v>

105
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 1>If you make your criteria for success </v>
<v Speaker 1>are razor sharp,</v>

106
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:22.441
<v Speaker 1>then you know every time you screw up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's great because then you could </v>

107
00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can either repair the,</v>

108
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the behavioral inadequacy or that </v>

109
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>conceptual inadequacy that you're using </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a tool in that situation.</v>

110
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you could adjust your damn plan</v>
<v Speaker 1>either way you can fix it.</v>

111
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.050
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

112
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>so you're living in one of these bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and you might as well,</v>

113
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.820
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me you might as well make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best one you could live in because </v>

114
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 1>you don't have anything better to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

115
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do it consciously,</v>

116
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>and this is what the psychoanalyst </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out is that you have innumerable</v>

117
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 1>quasi autonomous subsystems that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you up,</v>

118
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 1>that will generate stories impulsively </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll just act them out.</v>

119
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 1>And you know that because you watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself over two weeks and you think,</v>

120
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of stupid things in the last</v>

121
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 1>two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

122
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's because you're a random.</v>

123
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>You're a collection of somewhat random,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quasi autonomous personality units and </v>

124
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.780
<v Speaker 1>lacking a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just going to fire off whenever </v>

125
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.780
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

126
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>first you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're thirsty.</v>

127
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Then you want to go to bed with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>

128
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:32.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you want to sleep in and you want </v>

129
00:06:32.921 --> 00:06:34.961
<v Speaker 1>to tell your boss off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you want to curse at the guy that </v>

130
00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 1>cuts you off in traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're kind of like a two year</v>

131
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:41.741
<v Speaker 1>just it's one emotional frame after </v>
<v Speaker 1>another vying for dominance.</v>

133
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 1>There's no overarching hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no king at the top.</v>
