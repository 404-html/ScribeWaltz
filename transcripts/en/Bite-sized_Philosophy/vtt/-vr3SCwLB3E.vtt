1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Resentment for secure to comment on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently well established new.</v>

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.670
<v Speaker 1>This idea that men have a collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>common collective interests and women </v>

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.230
<v Speaker 1>have a separate common collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests class interest in these </v>

4
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they to conflict?</v>

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Speaker 1>There's a competition sometimes on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective level.</v>

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there is competition between men</v>

7
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:26.770
<v Speaker 1>and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's nested inside a broader arena.</v>

8
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Cooperation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>this is another thing that you learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>from reading Psj if you're,</v>

10
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:36.471
<v Speaker 1>if you're careful this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because piaget was smart enough to </v>

11
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:39.321
<v Speaker 1>understand that there is no dichotomous </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition between cooperation and </v>

12
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.800
<v Speaker 1>one of the sort of tenants of the kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of left this mumble jumble that I hate </v>

14
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>is that you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids shouldn't play competitive games,</v>

15
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be cooperative games.</v>

16
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

17
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>let's take that apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take hockey.</v>

18
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Is it competitive or cooperative?</v>

19
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's competitive.</v>

20
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

21
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>No one brings a basketball to the hockey</v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

22
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one brings a chessboard.</v>

23
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Everyone that comes to the hockey game </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes there to play hockey.</v>

24
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.900
<v Speaker 1>That constitutes cooperation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll mutually define the aim or does </v>

25
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>any cooperation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll mutually define the aim,</v>

26
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>will assign each other rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll all agree to stick to the roles.</v>

27
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cooperation and if you break the </v>

28
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.301
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens to you get stuck in the </v>

29
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:29.301
<v Speaker 1>penalty box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not playing hockey off you go.</v>

30
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>And people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people go off,</v>

31
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.640
<v Speaker 1>they go sit in the penalty box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't go kill the referee,</v>

32
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.720
<v Speaker 1>they go and sit in the penalty box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>six foot seven slash 300 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>

34
00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what about within the team?</v>

35
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Cooperation or competition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.080
<v Speaker 1>each team member is trying to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best player but it try not passing to </v>

37
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 1>your colleagues and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're really good,</v>

38
00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:58.850
<v Speaker 1>they'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just a diva and no one's going to</v>

39
00:01:58.851 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>be happy with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.360
<v Speaker 1>they'll put horrible things in your beer</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the game.</v>

41
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's cooperation there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a Meta level of </v>

42
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 1>cooperation which is that everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to improve their skills similar </v>

43
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.170
<v Speaker 1>honestly and so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that serves a higher order good.</v>

44
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.490
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's trying to learn how to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good player so that they can play many</v>

45
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

46
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:22.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't play competitive games.</v>

47
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.350
<v Speaker 1>So like you must've been educated at </v>
<v Speaker 1>noisey.</v>

48
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very sad and it's so,</v>

49
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.810
<v Speaker 1>so ignorant for people who know </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about child development to say</v>

50
00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:40.570
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just what is with you?</v>

51
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Where were you educated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or where were you educated is the right </v>

52
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

53
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.290
<v Speaker 1>and then so with men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there is group competition.</v>

54
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're competing roughly speaking with </v>

55
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>all your classmates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.200
<v Speaker 1>And some of the women are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>outshine you.</v>

57
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.450
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's tough for men.</v>

58
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.810
<v Speaker 1>It's particularly tough for men because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious how you compete full </v>

59
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:09.241
<v Speaker 1>bore with women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious and we don't know how </v>

60
00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:09.241
<v Speaker 1>to solve that problem.</v>
