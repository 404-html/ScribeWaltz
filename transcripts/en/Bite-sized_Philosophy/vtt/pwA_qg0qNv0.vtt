00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I started telling you last week about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of the voyage to the </v>

2
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:11.031
<v Speaker 1>underworld and I want to tell you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more about that.</v>

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.920
<v Speaker 1>You in particular conceptualize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>voyage to the underworld as a journey </v>

4
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:24.231
<v Speaker 1>into the unconscious and the unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the psychoanalyst is a place of </v>

5
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.530
<v Speaker 1>fantasy and dream and implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition and habit and that's all </v>

6
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:37.761
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an unconscious and it's </v>

8
00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>perfectly reasonable to conceptualize it</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

9
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:44.151
<v Speaker 1>that the big difference I think between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalysts and the later more </v>

10
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:48.471
<v Speaker 1>empirical scientists is that the cycle </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyst sort of envisioned your psyche </v>

11
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.830
<v Speaker 1>as a place of living partial </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities instead of cognitive </v>

12
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>computational systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:09.111
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took into account the fact that </v>

14
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:11.080
<v Speaker 1>you're alive and that the parts of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are alive and you know there's,</v>

15
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a neuroscientist named </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

16
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to say his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gaza,</v>

17
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Nigga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong because that is adding guy.</v>

18
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it.</v>

19
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did some of the earliest experiments </v>

20
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>on split brains and so sometimes if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have intractable epilepsy,</v>

21
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:34.491
<v Speaker 1>which I wouldn't recommend by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the surgical procedures for </v>

22
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>mediating its negative effects is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something called a,</v>

23
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>you cut the corpus callosum and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very large,</v>

24
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 1>very large structure in the brain that </v>
<v Speaker 1>connects the two separate hemispheres.</v>

25
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.300
<v Speaker 1>And No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious why we have two </v>

26
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.101
<v Speaker 1>separate hemispheres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'll tell you a little bit </v>

27
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:55.101
<v Speaker 1>about why I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

28
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>they do communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

29
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>what [inaudible] demonstrated was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell one hemisphere something </v>

30
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.490
<v Speaker 1>without the other one knowing that both </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemispheres we're conscious and that the</v>

31
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>consciousness was somewhat independent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really strange.</v>

32
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes very interesting readings,</v>

33
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 1>reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>because it suggests that fragments of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>

35
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:27.441
<v Speaker 1>you could think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have fragments of yourself within </v>

36
00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>you that are like low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of you,</v>

37
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

38
00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>and the psychoanalysts would think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those more as they're kind of like,</v>

39
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of like one I giants.</v>

40
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>That might be a way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

41
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>If you were thinking about it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastical way,</v>

42
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.680
<v Speaker 1>so there's the angry you and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've all come in contact with the </v>

43
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>angry you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a rather rigid.</v>

44
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing you might say </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

45
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.480
<v Speaker 1>It's impulsive and short term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't think much about the past </v>

46
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>unless it's bad things about whoever </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're angry at,</v>

47
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>in which case it thinks about them a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

48
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not too concerned with longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>future consequences and mostly at wants </v>

49
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.611
<v Speaker 1>to be right and you know when angry you </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappears and normal,</v>

50
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>you assuming such a thing exists </v>
<v Speaker 1>reappears.</v>

51
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.920
<v Speaker 1>You can be perfectly shocked about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry you behaved and in fact sometimes </v>

52
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.060
<v Speaker 1>if angry you really gets out of hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it might in a battle and a war.</v>

53
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.390
<v Speaker 1>It might do things that you just can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you would do and under </v>

54
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.441
<v Speaker 1>those circumstances you can reveal parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of yourself to yourself that are so </v>

55
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:43.531
<v Speaker 1>foreign and so horrifying that it will </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave you with posttraumatic stress </v>

56
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:51.061
<v Speaker 1>disorder because it is the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>many but not all.</v>

57
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>People who suffer from post traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress disorder,</v>

58
00:03:55.631 --> 00:04:00.631
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's battlefield related,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it because of something they did </v>

59
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>rather than something they saw or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that happened to them.</v>

60
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's really worth thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of weird potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>nested inside people and you know,</v>

62
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:16.501
<v Speaker 1>you don't see it under normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances because the circumstances </v>

63
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:19.741
<v Speaker 1>are normal and part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we liked the circumstances to be normal </v>

64
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>is precisely so that we don't see those </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of people.</v>

65
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to see.</v>
