00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Psychopaths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope non naively also having dealt </v>

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>with psychopaths in my clinical practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say now and then in my life,</v>

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in psychopaths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that we know enough to </v>

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>say there are people born without </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience.</v>

6
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the psychometric </v>

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>measurement of psychopathy is everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it should be.</v>

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to model it bay in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>big five domain.</v>

9
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I think now it's complicated because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would say a psychopath,</v>

10
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>the classic psychopath is likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroverted,</v>

11
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:42.651
<v Speaker 1>especially assertive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable and unconscientious and </v>

12
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>maybe extremely low in neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't frighten them.</v>

13
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>But so that's a rare combination because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extreme on many traits,</v>

14
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>

15
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:57.321
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that that means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone with that personality </v>

16
00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.801
<v Speaker 1>configuration is doomed from birth to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological existence because there's </v>

17
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>things about psychopathy that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

18
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>that the classifiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who claim like collectively that </v>

19
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>the psychopath is born in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't explain.</v>

20
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

21
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>what about the cruelty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be a motive there.</v>

22
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our passionless and they lack,</v>

23
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>they lack emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>why are they cruel then for </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment?</v>

25
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you have to explain the </v>

26
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.211
<v Speaker 1>entertainment motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a failure in some sense </v>

27
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:35.481
<v Speaker 1>with the classic psychopathy theorists </v>
<v Speaker 1>to come to grips with the problem of </v>

28
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's skirted over and you can't do that.</v>

29
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:42.471
<v Speaker 1>If you're talking about psychopathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like malevolence is the bloody </v>

30
00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:42.471
<v Speaker 1>issue here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

31
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.140
<v Speaker 1>the other issue with this psychopath is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's irredeemable,</v>

32
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>

33
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we know enough to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>such claims now and that doesn't.</v>

34
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.350
<v Speaker 1>I know the psychopathy literature quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>well and I have great respect for their </v>

35
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>primary researchers in the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make that perfectly clear,</v>

36
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>but we're talking at a different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking,</v>

37
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>we're approaching the problem from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different level of analysis here.</v>

38
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:11.091
<v Speaker 1>Something like a spiritual level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis and I don't think that there's </v>

39
00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:14.721
<v Speaker 1>an easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy translation from the descriptive </v>

40
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>psychometric psychiatric approach to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual level.</v>

41
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.550
<v Speaker 1>They don't match and I'm more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say let's not assume the soul is doomed </v>

42
00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>from birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

43
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm loath to think that there are people</v>

44
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:34.041
<v Speaker 1>born irredeemable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I do think there are </v>

45
00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:37.521
<v Speaker 1>irredeemable people knew that the death </v>
<v Speaker 1>penalty issues interesting in that </v>

46
00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.650
<v Speaker 1>because I've read a lot about really </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible people and I've also read a lot</v>

48
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>about what really terrible people said </v>
<v Speaker 1>about themselves and many of them wished</v>

49
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:52.131
<v Speaker 1>for the death penalty and so it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely clear that there are things </v>

50
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>that you can do that deserved the death </v>
<v Speaker 1>penalty,</v>

51
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>should have the right to impose it.</v>

52
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.030
<v Speaker 1>That's a different question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

53
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.810
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
