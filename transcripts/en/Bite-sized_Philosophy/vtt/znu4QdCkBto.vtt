00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.850
<v Speaker 1>By noon the dragon filled the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its head hung out the front door,</v>

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.050
<v Speaker 1>it's tail hung out the backdoor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't a room in the house that </v>

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:09.050
<v Speaker 1>didn't have some part of the dragon in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I bet that there is a house like that on</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you will live.</v>

5
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's a lot of houses,</v>

6
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.440
<v Speaker 1>some of you live in apartments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really matter,</v>

7
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:20.350
<v Speaker 1>but I bet you if you live in a house on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a block of houses,</v>

8
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>there's at least one house on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>street where the tail of the dragon has </v>

9
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.761
<v Speaker 1>started to come out of the house and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what that's like it because it's </v>

10
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.030
<v Speaker 1>the house that you don't really want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at when you walk by,</v>

11
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe,</v>

12
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that needs a new roof and like the doors</v>

13
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 1>a little bit crooked and the law isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>cotton.</v>

14
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some rusty things lying around </v>

15
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>there and like it's just not taken care </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

16
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you know from the gossip in </v>

17
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>the neighborhood to that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something going on in that house.</v>

18
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.860
<v Speaker 1>It is just not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's gotten to the point where it's </v>

19
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.661
<v Speaker 1>so not good that it's starting to spread</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself out beyond the domestic confines </v>

20
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.490
<v Speaker 1>of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

21
00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:02.491
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run into people like that now and </v>

22
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:02.491
<v Speaker 1>then too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice this.</v>

23
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:02.491
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

24
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this has happened to any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you,</v>

25
00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:06.340
<v Speaker 1>but it might have happened to you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways.</v>

26
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>You know that there are those people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't not tell you everything about </v>

27
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.820
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you've hardly even met them.</v>

28
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.340
<v Speaker 1>If you see someone who's really in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble,</v>

29
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll sit on the bus and somebody who's</v>

30
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.360
<v Speaker 1>clearly on the road to being thoroughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>de deranged,</v>

31
00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:27.361
<v Speaker 1>we'll sit down beside you and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>start telling you about the problems of </v>

32
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:27.361
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>

33
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:27.361
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:32.041
<v Speaker 1>that the dragon that they're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with is so big that they can't even </v>

35
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:34.951
<v Speaker 1>contain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so desperate to have it dealt </v>

36
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:36.790
<v Speaker 1>with that they can't not talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

37
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:39.010
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones that.</v>

38
00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 1>What is that stupid little phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tmi.</v>

39
00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much information.</v>

40
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

41
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:49.411
<v Speaker 1>well why does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because people are dealing with </v>

42
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:52.651
<v Speaker 1>anomalies and unexpected occurrences and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedies and they cannot articulate a </v>

43
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 1>solution and most people think by </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

44
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Speaker 1>which is also part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy works.</v>

45
00:01:58.781 --> 00:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

46
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:01.420
<v Speaker 1>do you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doubt it.</v>

47
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.350
<v Speaker 1>You might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very few people think you know,</v>

48
00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:10.351
<v Speaker 1>and so if you want to solve a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to talk it over with a friend </v>

49
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 1>and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might just think that you're talking</v>

50
00:02:11.171 --> 00:02:13.480
<v Speaker 1>about the problem sorta you know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>

51
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:15.010
<v Speaker 1>but you're talking about so you don't.</v>

52
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.060
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you articulate the problem space.</v>

53
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.510
<v Speaker 1>You start to generate potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypotheses about solutions,</v>

54
00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 1>but more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking to someone,</v>

55
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>you can watch them just like the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid with the mouse would watch the </v>

56
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

57
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I think the problem is.</v>

58
00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:31.030
<v Speaker 1>And if you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:33.850
<v Speaker 1>you're listening and you go like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You roll your eyes.</v>

60
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:38.851
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hint to the person that maybe </v>

61
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:38.851
<v Speaker 1>that's not the most appropriate way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate the problem.</v>

62
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe you don't roll your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

63
00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:45.781
<v Speaker 1>you don't encourage them or maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you what the problem is and you </v>

64
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:46.780
<v Speaker 1>really actively engaged in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're nodding.</v>

65
00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Well then they know that maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated that way,</v>

66
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:54.121
<v Speaker 1>someone have sane and tolerable would </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate it and then they can walk </v>

67
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:55.240
<v Speaker 1>through the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

68
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>so when you sit down beside someone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to tell you everything,</v>

69
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you know is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have anyone to listen to them</v>

70
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.130
<v Speaker 1>and part of what happens in therapy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge part of it is that you just </v>

71
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.031
<v Speaker 1>listened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have one client that's all I ever do </v>

72
00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:18.031
<v Speaker 1>with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She comes in twice a week,</v>

73
00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:21.870
<v Speaker 1>once every two weeks and I just sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and listen to her for an hour and </v>

74
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.250
<v Speaker 1>now I can maybe have a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion with her for the last 10 </v>

75
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.071
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I try to say anything for the </v>

76
00:03:29.071 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>first 50 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just looks kinda irritated.</v>

77
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:34.651
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I've interrupted the flow of </v>

78
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the interaction and she's alone.</v>

79
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>She didn't have nobody to talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

80
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>she wants to listen to herself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

81
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>and she can't do that by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has to have someone to do it with.</v>

82
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.270
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think by talking and some people </v>

83
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.841
<v Speaker 1>have no one to talk to and so their </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems start to spill out and you </v>

84
00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:58.651
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by that time you can't even help them </v>

85
00:03:58.651 --> 00:03:58.651
<v Speaker 1>usually because if you listened for </v>
<v Speaker 1>three years,</v>

86
00:03:58.651 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be enough listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just listen forever and you never get to</v>

87
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of it.</v>
