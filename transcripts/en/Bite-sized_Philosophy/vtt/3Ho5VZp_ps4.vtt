00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Afraid of the answers to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can left and right wing people ever </v>

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>meaningfully communicate with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

4
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And I'm wondering if you can comment a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little about temporary mentality and the</v>

5
00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:11.460
<v Speaker 1>differences there in</v>

6
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.350
<v Speaker 2>that's what they do in a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

7
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.380
<v Speaker 2>the lefties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're high in openness and low in </v>

8
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and that means they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like responsibility that much,</v>

9
00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:27.971
<v Speaker 2>but they're pretty damn creative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not very orderly especially </v>

10
00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 2>they're not very orderly and that's part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of conscientiousness by the way.</v>

11
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.690
<v Speaker 2>And so they're good at being artists and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're good at being entrepreneurs,</v>

12
00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:37.691
<v Speaker 2>but they're terrible at running things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then the conservatives on the other </v>

13
00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:37.691
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are low in openness,</v>

14
00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:42.641
<v Speaker 2>which is the treat creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean they're stupid by the </v>

15
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:42.641
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just means they're,</v>

16
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:42.920
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

17
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking isn't as free form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>

18
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:48.800
<v Speaker 2>And so it's more constrained and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>high in conscientiousness,</v>

19
00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:53.801
<v Speaker 2>especially orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're damn good at running things </v>

20
00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 2>that already work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need the liberals.</v>

21
00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.340
<v Speaker 2>There wouldn't be high openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low conscientiousness if there wasn't a </v>

22
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.340
<v Speaker 2>niche for it.</v>

23
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 2>And you need the conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes the liberals are right,</v>

24
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.600
<v Speaker 2>the borders should be more open because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their fundamental claim,</v>

25
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes the conservatives are </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

26
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:12.131
<v Speaker 2>the borders between things should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>more closed and because they're both </v>

27
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:16.421
<v Speaker 2>right some of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because the environment keeps </v>

28
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:19.091
<v Speaker 2>snaking around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have dialogue between the </v>

29
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:22.271
<v Speaker 2>two sources constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly so that the the polity can </v>

30
00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 2>orient itself as the snake of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment moves,</v>

31
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.560
<v Speaker 2>and that's why you need free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the left and the right get along </v>

32
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 2>perfectly well together as long as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can talk to each other,</v>

33
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:32.000
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as they can't talk to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

34
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:37.001
<v Speaker 2>then the alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only one altar to alternatives </v>

35
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:38.300
<v Speaker 2>to negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simple as that.</v>

36
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.790
<v Speaker 2>One is slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other is tyranny.</v>

37
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.300
<v Speaker 2>So if those you cannot negotiate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>will either become your slaves or your </v>

38
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 2>tyrants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you wipe outs free speech,</v>

39
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 2>then that's what you're left with and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why free speech isn't just </v>

40
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 2>another right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Christ's sake.</v>

41
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not just another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

42
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.440
<v Speaker 2>How dumb can you be to think that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know anything if you think that </v>

43
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.000
<v Speaker 2>it's the mechanism by which people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>different opinions talk instead of </v>

44
00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 2>strangling each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and,</v>

45
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want them to strangle each </v>

46
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.510
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you might then really,</v>

47
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.370
<v Speaker 2>you might then take away the right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>express their opinion and watched the </v>

48
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.331
<v Speaker 2>whole thing go up in flames and go like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this because maybe that's what a big </v>

49
00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:22.790
<v Speaker 2>part of you want.</v>
