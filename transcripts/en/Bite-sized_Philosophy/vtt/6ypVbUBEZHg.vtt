1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.600
<v Speaker 1>So these creatures engaging in dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>disputes and,</v>

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.650
<v Speaker 1>and I think dominance is the right way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about it because lobsters </v>

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.650
<v Speaker 1>aren't very empathic and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>very social.</v>

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.030
<v Speaker 1>And so it really is the toughest lobster</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wins,</v>

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's so cool about the lobster is </v>

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>that when a lobster wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he flexes and gets bigger.</v>

7
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:21.250
<v Speaker 1>So he looks bigger because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>winner.</v>

8
00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's advertising that and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological,</v>

9
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>the neurochemical system that makes him </v>
<v Speaker 1>flex his serotonergic and you think,</v>

10
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

11
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>What the hell does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:35.241
<v Speaker 1>tell you what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same chemical that's affected </v>

13
00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>by antidepressants in human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like,</v>

14
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>if you're depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're defeated lobster.</v>

15
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm small,</v>

16
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>things are dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fight.</v>

18
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>You give somebody an anti depressants </v>
<v Speaker 1>like cup they stretch and then they're </v>

19
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>ready to like take on the world again.</v>

20
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give lobsters who just got </v>

21
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.450
<v Speaker 1>defeated in a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin,</v>

22
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 1>then they stretch out and they'll fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

23
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's like we separated from those </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures on the evolutionary timescale.</v>

24
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere between 350 and 600 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago and the damn neurochemistry is</v>

25
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's another indication of just</v>

26
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>how important hierarchies of authority </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

27
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been conserved since the time of</v>

28
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>lobsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>There were trees around when lobsters </v>
<v Speaker 1>first first manifested themselves on the</v>

30
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:23.091
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is these </v>

31
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:23.091
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies that I've been talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

32
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:27.170
<v Speaker 1>those things are older than trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the truisms for what </v>

33
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>constitutes real from a Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is that,</v>

34
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>which has been around the longest period</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>

35
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's had the longest period of </v>

36
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>time to exert selection pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.780
<v Speaker 1>we know we evolved and lived in trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something on the order of 60 million </v>

38
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.780
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

39
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.630
<v Speaker 1>We're talking 10 times as far back as </v>
<v Speaker 1>that for the hierarchy.</v>

40
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that human beings that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy is something that has </v>

41
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.711
<v Speaker 1>exerted selection pressure on human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings is I don't think that's a </v>

42
00:01:57.711 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>disputable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a disputable issue.</v>

43
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.960
<v Speaker 1>How it's done at an exactly what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means we can argue about,</v>

44
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.970
<v Speaker 1>but like that sort of biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuity is just absolutely </v>

45
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.970
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

46
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was funny because I revealed this </v>

47
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.970
<v Speaker 1>finding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't discover this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read about it,</v>

49
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.440
<v Speaker 1>but I talked to my graduate students </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

50
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.070
<v Speaker 1>I used to take them out for breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>and they were very contentious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snappy bunch and uh,</v>

52
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.060
<v Speaker 1>and they're always trying to one up each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and they were quite witty and for </v>

53
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>like six months until it got very </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying.</v>

54
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Every time one of them went up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

55
00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:30.040
<v Speaker 1>they'd stretch themselves out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like snap their hands.</v>

56
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>

57
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>that was very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

58
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.260
<v Speaker 1>it was really very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see this in lobsters and so </v>

59
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.260
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

60
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the other thing that's really</v>

61
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:43.940
<v Speaker 1>cool about lobsters is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 1>let's say you've been like top lobster </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time,</v>

63
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:49.550
<v Speaker 1>but you're getting kind of old and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>young lobster just,</v>

64
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whales the hell out of you.</v>

65
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>And so you're all depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thing is your brain is dominant,</v>

66
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have much of a brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're a lobster.</v>

67
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>And so now what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you just lost.</v>

68
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.480
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is while your brain will </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolve and then you'll grow a </v>

69
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 1>subordinate brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And so that's where thinking about too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right here,</v>

71
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

72
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>if any of you who've ever been seriously</v>
<v Speaker 1>defeated in life,</v>

73
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>you know what that's like.</v>

74
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dissenter,</v>

75
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>a dissolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're lucky,</v>

76
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>a regrowth and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe not as the same person,</v>

77
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens to people with </v>
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>

78
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:30.781
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their brains undergo permanent </v>

79
00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:32.611
<v Speaker 1>neurological transformation and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they then inhabit a world that's </v>

80
00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 1>much more dangerous than the world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they inhabited to begin with.</v>

81
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:39.061
<v Speaker 1>But we also know too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have posttraumatic stress </v>

82
00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>disorder or depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your hippocampus shrinks,</v>

83
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He dies and shrinks,</v>

84
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>and you can sometimes get it to grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

85
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:48.571
<v Speaker 1>Your hippocampus shrinks and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amygdala and the Amygdala increases </v>

86
00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:52.711
<v Speaker 1>emotional sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the hippocampus inhibits emotional </v>

87
00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you've been badly defeated,</v>

88
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>the hippocampus shrinks and the amygdala</v>
<v Speaker 1>grows.</v>

89
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Now if you recover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hippocampus will regrow.</v>

90
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>And antidepressants actually seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help that.</v>

91
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>But the damn Amygdala never shrinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

92
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.030
<v Speaker 1>And so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another lesson from the </v>

93
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.030
<v Speaker 1>lobster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a terrifying one,</v>

94
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.190
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one like,</v>

95
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting that you can relate </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

96
00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

97
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I get what that poor crustaceans going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

98
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
