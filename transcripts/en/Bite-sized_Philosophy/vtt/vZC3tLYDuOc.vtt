00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.330
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy to romanticize nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a city dweller </v>

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>who's never had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.900
<v Speaker 1>wander out in the northern woods in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the summer and get eaten by </v>

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.411
<v Speaker 1>black flies and mosquitoes starving to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death while trying to track down an </v>

5
00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy to romanticize nature.</v>

6
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:22.821
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer and other diseases tend to </v>

7
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>disabuse you of the pure beauty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature and nature is a very,</v>

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 1>very destructive force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

9
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>it's against us all the time as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>for us,</v>

10
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:34.371
<v Speaker 1>and another thing that's really not well</v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced in our society is the anti </v>

11
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>humanism that's become part and parcel </v>
<v Speaker 1>of radical discussions everywhere.</v>

12
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are regarded as a cancer on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>

13
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.930
<v Speaker 1>To quote the what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Club of Rome worrying about the </v>

14
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:52.071
<v Speaker 1>population explosion and we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty because we're destroying things </v>

15
00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>as fast as we can possibly manage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Jesus,</v>

16
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>everything around us is always trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill us.</v>

17
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time we're just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay alive.</v>

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're corrupt and sore or social </v>

19
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>structures and people get greedy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>careless,</v>

20
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like nature's all shining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A wonderful young lady waiting in the </v>

21
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:14.961
<v Speaker 1>wilderness to embrace us positively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the old hag that's going to kill </v>

22
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>you every possible way and you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>defend yourself against that.</v>

23
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:23.331
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings have only been in the </v>

24
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:25.401
<v Speaker 1>position since 1960 since we ever had </v>
<v Speaker 1>any conceptualization of our potential </v>

25
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>to change the planet on a planetary </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>

26
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>It's been like four generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:36.651
<v Speaker 1>back in the eighties and nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Huxley was commissioned by the </v>

28
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:40.491
<v Speaker 1>English parliament to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to investigate the carrying capacity of </v>

29
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>the oceans and his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a great biologist.</v>

30
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.010
<v Speaker 1>His report was that there are so damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>many fish in the ocean that every human </v>

31
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.181
<v Speaker 1>being could fish every day for the rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his life and catch everything he </v>

32
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>possibly could and we wouldn't put a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dent in it.</v>

33
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:56.311 --> 00:02:01.311
<v Speaker 1>that's only a 120 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only woke up to the fact that we </v>

35
00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>became a planetary force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in 19 six states like,</v>

36
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you expect from people </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to get herself together as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast as we can and might be decent of us</v>

38
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:16.011
<v Speaker 1>to stop with the anti human rhetoric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is only going to lead to a bad </v>

39
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>if human beings are nothing but a cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the planet,</v>

41
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>then it's the bloody hero who </v>
<v Speaker 1>obliterates them.</v>

42
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that because it's the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets rid of cancer.</v>

43
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And when people watch the school </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooters in the mass shooters and they </v>

44
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.970
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

45
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.411
<v Speaker 1>what is it that motivates people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in which they could figure out </v>

46
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:34.330
<v Speaker 1>about half an hour if they did the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper reading,</v>

47
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>just read what they wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are a cancer on the planet.</v>

48
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Being as evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intrinsically,</v>

49
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take out everything I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>to show my displeasure with the </v>

50
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.251
<v Speaker 1>structure of reality and then I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to shoot myself just to show you how </v>

51
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>little I care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't understand that,</v>

52
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:55.941
<v Speaker 1>then you haven't looked very deeply into</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own heart because there could be a </v>

53
00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:55.941
<v Speaker 1>time in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>

54
00:02:55.941 --> 00:03:00.591
<v Speaker 1>where something terrible happens to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you'll be able to understand </v>

55
00:03:00.591 --> 00:03:00.591
<v Speaker 1>that perfectly.</v>
