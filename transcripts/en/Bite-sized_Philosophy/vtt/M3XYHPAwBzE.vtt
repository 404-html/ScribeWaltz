1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's this interesting phenomenon </v>

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.400
<v Speaker 1>that it's very characteristic of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>of societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe pretty much everywhere it's </v>

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.291
<v Speaker 1>being studied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can calculate an index called </v>

5
00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:19.731
<v Speaker 1>the Gini Coefficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Gini Coefficient is a number that </v>

6
00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:23.631
<v Speaker 1>represents how much inequality of income</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution there isn't a given </v>

7
00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:28.161
<v Speaker 1>geographical area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could calculate a Gini </v>

8
00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Coefficient for a street or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>an area in a city or a city or a state </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a country.</v>

10
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>You can do it at all those levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

11
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.090
<v Speaker 1>what you find is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>you always hear this idea that poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes crime.</v>

13
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a classic leftwing idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's wrong,</v>

14
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>it's seriously wrong and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly wrong.</v>

15
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's definitively wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

16
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>so there's no argument about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already been established.</v>

17
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.360
<v Speaker 1>What causes crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially aggressive crime is relative </v>

18
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 1>poverty and relative poverty is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing as poverty at all.</v>

19
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>It's seriously not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poverty is when you don't have enough to</v>

20
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:09.921
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relative poverty is when the guy next </v>

21
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:10.170
<v Speaker 1>door has a much better car than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

22
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of relative poverty in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>

23
00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:18.291
<v Speaker 1>And there's some absolute poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even the absolute poverty in the </v>

24
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:22.460
<v Speaker 1>United States is nothing like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute poverty say in places like </v>

25
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>India or in Subsaharan Africa where </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute poverty means you have nothing.</v>

26
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Now what's really interesting about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gini Coefficient is that if you go to </v>

27
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>places where everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking is poor,</v>

28
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.950
<v Speaker 1>say by national standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think South Dakota was often used as </v>

29
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>an example or maybe one of the maritime </v>
<v Speaker 1>provinces like Newfoundland,</v>

30
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.980
<v Speaker 1>where there's where there's low average </v>
<v Speaker 1>income,</v>

31
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty flat distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's almost no crime.</v>

32
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>And if you go to the places where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's rich,</v>

33
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>then there's almost no crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you go places where there were </v>

34
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.750
<v Speaker 1>poor people and moderately well off </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and rich people and the </v>

35
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:08.301
<v Speaker 1>distribution is really steep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the rate of aggressive behavior </v>

36
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>among young men and it's usually within </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own ethnic group,</v>

37
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>starts to spot skyrocket out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

38
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.800
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that seems to be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the dominance hierarchy is too steep </v>

39
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.511
<v Speaker 1>than the young men have no likelihood of</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbing to a dominant position well </v>

40
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:28.731
<v Speaker 1>playing the standard social game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what they do is turn to </v>

41
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression to,</v>

42
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>to make their mark on the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it works too.</v>

43
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing is that make no </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake about it.</v>

44
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:39.501
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking for status in a place </v>

45
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>where status is hard to achieve and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the meanest,</v>

46
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>toughest guy around then and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around a bunch of people who like,</v>

47
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:49.341
<v Speaker 1>you don't have much money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to benefit from that </v>

48
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:49.341
<v Speaker 1>status if it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Because they know that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is higher than it is in Canada </v>

50
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

51
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:06.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can make a real conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument for making sure that the </v>

53
00:03:06.391 --> 00:03:10.441
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are very anti income </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution and we figured that's </v>

54
00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>because of the guys that have this male </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence,</v>

55
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they identify with this male </v>

56
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.451
<v Speaker 1>independence factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be distributing </v>

57
00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>resources to people who are down in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy because they will.</v>

58
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>They want them down in the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

59
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>They want there to be a difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the people on top and the people</v>

60
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>on the bottom so that they can be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on top.</v>

61
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>So that it increases the relative </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness,</v>

62
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:34.441
<v Speaker 1>like it's a perfectly logical game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they presume that while the rules are </v>

63
00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:39.031
<v Speaker 1>set up and like every man can go for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do as fast in the winter winds and the </v>

64
00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>loser loses and that's just how it is.</v>

65
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>And don't ask me to fix it because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to,</v>

66
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And besides that it's,</v>

67
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it distasteful to attempt to fix </v>

68
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.580
<v Speaker 1>it more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

69
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a moral issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an intellectual issue.</v>

70
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

71
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.290
<v Speaker 1>you can make a case however you can make</v>
<v Speaker 1>a case from the conservative point of </v>

72
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.311
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to say beliefs </v>

73
00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>and religious traditionalism and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to maintain social stability that</v>

74
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't let income distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>become two unequal.</v>

75
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the big things your society </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to do is to make sure that that </v>

76
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get out of hand because it tends</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out of hand.</v>

77
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:22.261
<v Speaker 1>It tends towards a few people having </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and almost everyone else </v>

78
00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>having nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural in a sense.</v>

79
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural consequence of economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>progression,</v>

80
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 1>which is actually something that marks </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out,</v>

81
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.230
<v Speaker 1>although an Italian name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peritoneal had figured it out at </v>

82
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>approximately the same time and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot more conceptual clarity,</v>

83
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 1>but the more unequal you let your </v>
<v Speaker 1>society get,</v>

84
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 1>the higher the probability of death </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking through through violent</v>

85
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:46.490
<v Speaker 1>causes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

86
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.760
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

87
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.280
<v Speaker 1>but I'm telling you why it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.060
<v Speaker 1>men want to climb the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and the reason they want to </v>

89
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.191
<v Speaker 1>call them the dominance hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's how they get access to </v>

90
00:04:59.191 --> 00:04:59.191
<v Speaker 1>women</v>

91
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 2>fucking familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>familiar in the structure.</v>

92
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.870
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like we all want to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the structure yourself.</v>

93
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this contradictory problem.</v>

94
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 1>We want to be protected by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

95
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>but we want to advance our position </v>
<v Speaker 1>within it.</v>

96
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>And so that means what that should mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

97
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:28.831
<v Speaker 1>I think the definition of civilized </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior is that you're allowed to </v>

98
00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:33.361
<v Speaker 1>advance your position within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure as long as you don't disrupt </v>

99
00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 1>it negatively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

100
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:36.910
<v Speaker 1>and I think most people do do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

101
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:41.911
<v Speaker 1>I think people in civilized countries do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that so effectively that it's an </v>

102
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:46.350
<v Speaker 1>absolute incomprehensible miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand how or why it ever </v>

103
00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:49.750
<v Speaker 1>got established,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like a psychopath will.</v>

104
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>He climbed the ladder and cut the rungs </v>
<v Speaker 1>off underneath them fundamentally,</v>

105
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he doesn't care.</v>

106
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even care if the damn thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintains itself.</v>

107
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's perfectly willing to have it </v>

108
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 1>destroyed after he's exhausted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.970
<v Speaker 1>but if everyone acted like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even if a fairly substantial </v>

110
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>percentage of people acted like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing would come to a halt,</v>

111
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 1>virtually like in no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

112
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>so mean.</v>

113
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>

114
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>You might hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the reason.</v>

115
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about was masculine violence.</v>

117
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing about masculine violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>is it only tends to emerge in situations</v>

118
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:35.351
<v Speaker 1>where there doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There don't seem to be any other </v>

119
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 1>reasonably viable means of advancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>status.</v>

120
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 1>So it's not reasonable to say that men </v>
<v Speaker 1>are aggressive.</v>

121
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>You can say that on average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men are more aggressive than women.</v>

122
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.200
<v Speaker 1>And you can also say that if that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>put men in a situation where they have </v>

123
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.360
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they can see status differences,</v>

124
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 1>but they have no means of moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

125
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.320
<v Speaker 1>that they're likely to turn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression as a way of establishing </v>

126
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.520
<v Speaker 1>dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can say that that's the </v>

127
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.520
<v Speaker 1>reason for that is because it makes them</v>
<v Speaker 1>more attractive.</v>

128
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 1>What are the fundamental reasons</v>

129
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 2>I read this article was about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies are.</v>

130
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

131
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.450
<v Speaker 2>When one guy has two wives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean 50 percent of the population have</v>

132
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.360
<v Speaker 2>access to sex.</v>

133
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right.</v>

134
00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:26.260
<v Speaker 1>That the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

135
00:07:26.261 --> 00:07:31.261
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary psychology explanation </v>

136
00:07:31.261 --> 00:07:31.261
<v Speaker 1>for the pathology of polygamy is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

137
00:07:31.261 --> 00:07:33.760
<v Speaker 1>once you let it establish itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the men get ultra violent.</v>

138
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.040
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So would you say that</v>

139
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.910
<v Speaker 1>many people have said that and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

140
00:07:41.911 --> 00:07:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I think you can make a strong case for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

141
00:07:43.651 --> 00:07:46.560
<v Speaker 1>And I think the fundamental reason is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that you just pointed out,</v>

142
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is,</v>

143
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:53.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you rather have one woman or die </v>

144
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.420
<v Speaker 1>now or sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not quite right.</v>

145
00:07:57.421 --> 00:07:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Would you rather know next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Quite.</v>

146
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.570
<v Speaker 1>That's not quite right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you,</v>

147
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>it's more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you be willing to limit yourself </v>

148
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.731
<v Speaker 1>to one partner or have a shot at many </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners but a much higher probability </v>

149
00:08:08.101 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 1>of dying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

150
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.450
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guys will take that,</v>

151
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.340
<v Speaker 1>they'll take the high risk approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Speaker 1>so now if this doesn't delineate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in individual differences in </v>

153
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.650
<v Speaker 1>determining who's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive,</v>

154
00:08:22.651 --> 00:08:27.240
<v Speaker 1>because what'll happen is that as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gini Coefficient pressure rises,</v>

155
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:33.020
<v Speaker 1>the more aggressive men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the men who were more aggressive by </v>

156
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.300
<v Speaker 1>nature will get more aggressive first.</v>

157
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could imagine there it's a </v>

158
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 1>threshold phenomena in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So add,</v>

159
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.790
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should tell you as well as the </v>

160
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.331
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the Gini </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coefficient and male on male homicide </v>

161
00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:48.320
<v Speaker 1>isn't like point two or point three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about the correlation that </v>

162
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.010
<v Speaker 1>you'd get if you were predicting </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

163
00:08:50.011 --> 00:08:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Using personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like point eight or point nine.</v>

164
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like it eats up all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's explanation.</v>

165
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's a huge effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

166
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:00.890
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so big in affected.</v>

167
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.910
<v Speaker 1>You could basically say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well we figured that out.</v>

168
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Although psychologists never know when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they figured anything out in,</v>

169
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:09.850
<v Speaker 1>they keep endlessly retesting it over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over and over because you know,</v>

170
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how to bring our science </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a stock,</v>

171
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't accept the Gini </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coefficient aggression down,</v>

172
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:20.811
<v Speaker 1>it's like you might as well throw the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the social sciences out the </v>

173
00:09:20.811 --> 00:09:22.500
<v Speaker 1>window because the effect is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably powerful.</v>

174
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:23.930
<v Speaker 3>Let you go.</v>

175
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.300
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it at any level of analysis.</v>

176
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.820
<v Speaker 1>You can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it by county,</v>

177
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.120
<v Speaker 1>you can do it by city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it by state and you can do it</v>

178
00:09:34.121 --> 00:09:36.430
<v Speaker 1>by country and it works on all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

179
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.310
<v Speaker 3>Predicted aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

180
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a great question.</v>

182
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean the methodologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated studies have done exactly </v>

183
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.941
<v Speaker 1>that to ensure that while to ensure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually this phenomena rather than</v>

184
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.430
<v Speaker 1>other factors that might be operative in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that particular geographical area.</v>

185
00:09:55.210 --> 00:10:00.210
<v Speaker 1>So countries with a higher GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gini Coefficient or more violent and </v>

186
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.530
<v Speaker 1>cities within that country that have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than average Gini Coefficient for</v>

187
00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:04.450
<v Speaker 1>that country are more violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On average.</v>

188
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.520
<v Speaker 1>What's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very robust,</v>

189
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.320
<v Speaker 1>robust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robust finding.</v>

190
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.960
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

191
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:16.030
<v Speaker 1>so we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to say for the sake of </v>

192
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:20.041
<v Speaker 1>argument that you've got the male </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy and it's represented</v>

193
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.580
<v Speaker 1>as masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

194
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.700
<v Speaker 1>One of the things young said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought that women carried an image </v>

195
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 1>of Matt Nan in their unconscious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

196
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:33.400
<v Speaker 1>he thought that the image that women </v>
<v Speaker 1>carried of men in their unconscious with</v>

197
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.210
<v Speaker 1>a group of men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not an individual matt,</v>

198
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.460
<v Speaker 1>he called that the animus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas he believed that the image that </v>

199
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.541
<v Speaker 1>women image of women that men carried in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their collective unconscious was of a </v>

200
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:47.800
<v Speaker 1>single woman and he called that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anima.</v>
