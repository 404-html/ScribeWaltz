1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.150
<v Speaker 1>It's not an accident that the axiomatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>western individual as someone who was </v>

2
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>unfairly nailed to a cross and tortured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.130
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do about that?</v>

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about that for a long time </v>

6
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get together and a damn bb </v>

8
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.380
<v Speaker 1>because all that does is allow you to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>as horrible as you could possibly </v>

9
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>imagine in suffer from none of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

10
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how about we don't do that?</v>

11
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a deep Heidi in the west too.</v>

12
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up your damn suffering.</v>

13
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.350
<v Speaker 1>And Barrett,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to be a good person.</v>

14
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>So you don't make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>I read a lot about the terrible things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people have done to each other.</v>

17
00:00:56.551 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>You just cannot even imagine it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>awful.</v>

18
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.550
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to be someone like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

19
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.320
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a reason to be?</v>

20
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a lots of reasons to be God.</v>

21
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:12.590
<v Speaker 1>There's reasons to be resentful about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your existence.</v>

22
00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Everyone you know is gonna die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you too.</v>

23
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.220
<v Speaker 1>And there's going to be a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain along the way and lots of it's </v>

24
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.220
<v Speaker 1>going to be unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

25
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no wonder you're resentful.</v>

26
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like acted out and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

27
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>You make everything you're complaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>about infinitely worse.</v>

28
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 1>There's this idea that hell is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottomless pit and that's because no </v>

29
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 1>matter how bad it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some stupid son of a bitch,</v>

30
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:38.750
<v Speaker 1>like you could figure out a way to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it a lot worse.</v>

31
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

32
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.360
<v Speaker 1>what do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you accept it,</v>

33
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.760
<v Speaker 1>that's what life is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's suffering.</v>

34
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.480
<v Speaker 1>That's what the religious people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>always said,</v>

35
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>life is suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

36
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants to admit that?</v>

37
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think about it.</v>

38
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do in the face of that </v>

39
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.790
<v Speaker 1>suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to reduce it.</v>

40
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Start with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What good are you?</v>

41
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Get yourself together for Christ's sake </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that when your father dies,</v>

42
00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:13.501
<v Speaker 1>you're not wining away in a corner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can help plan the funeral and you </v>

43
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:15.370
<v Speaker 1>can stand up solidly so that people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>rely on you.</v>

44
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.070
<v Speaker 1>That's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be a damn victim.</v>

45
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.730
<v Speaker 1>You're a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus obviously</v>

46
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>put yourself together and then maybe if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself together,</v>

47
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>you know how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's wrong with you.</v>

48
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.400
<v Speaker 1>If you'll admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's a few things you could </v>

49
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>like Polish up a little bit that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might even be able to manage.</v>

50
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>You're insufficient present condition </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you might shine yourself up a </v>

51
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.080
<v Speaker 1>little bit and then your eyes will be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little more open.</v>

52
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Then you can try and yourself up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more and then maybe you could</v>

53
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.890
<v Speaker 1>bring your family together instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>having them be the hateful,</v>

54
00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:53.891
<v Speaker 1>spiteful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurotic in fighting batch that you're </v>

55
00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:54.920
<v Speaker 1>doomed to spend Christmas with.</v>

56
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>So when you fix yourself a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of humbly because you don't go on,</v>

57
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.020
<v Speaker 1>you're a fixer upper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there ever was one and then you got </v>

58
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.020
<v Speaker 1>to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

59
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>but can you figure out how to make peace</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your idiot brother?</v>

60
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>And probably not because he's just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb as you.</v>

61
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:16.321
<v Speaker 1>So the holiday hell are you gonna manage</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and so then you maybe you get </v>

62
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that way and your family sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of functioning and you find out,</v>

63
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>well that kind of relieved a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of suffering,</v>

64
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:25.621
<v Speaker 1>although it reduced the opportunities </v>
<v Speaker 1>for spiteful revenge and that's kind of </v>

65
00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:29.761
<v Speaker 1>a pain in the neck and so then you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family together a little bit and </v>

66
00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>your little clued in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then at least a bit because you've done </v>

67
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>something difficult that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

68
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.980
<v Speaker 1>You're a little wiser and so then maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could put a tend to do finger out </v>

69
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 1>beyond the family and try to change some</v>
<v Speaker 1>little thing without wrecking it.</v>

70
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like our society is complex and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>teach our students that they could just </v>

71
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.081
<v Speaker 1>fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like go fix a military helicopter </v>

72
00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:53.570
<v Speaker 1>and see how far you get with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're already going to dude.</v>

73
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>You're like a chimp with a wrench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whack.</v>

74
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better.</v>

75
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

76
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 1>it's not better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are complicated and to fix things</v>

77
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:07.021
<v Speaker 1>is really hard and you have to be like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>golden tool to fix things and you're </v>

78
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

79
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>and that's the other message of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>West.</v>

80
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like how do you overcome the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering of the of life?</v>

81
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying it's only the message</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the West.</v>

82
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>How do you overcome the suffering of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life has been a better person.</v>

83
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>That's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

84
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:31.201
<v Speaker 1>that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes responsibility and I think you </v>

85
00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you said to someone,</v>

86
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.530
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a meaningful life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you do matters.</v>

87
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>That's the definition of a meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

88
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.050
<v Speaker 1>but everything you do matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have to carry that with </v>

89
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.951
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you want to just forget about the </v>

90
00:04:46.951 --> 00:04:50.311
<v Speaker 1>whole meaning thing and then you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any responsibility because who the </v>

91
00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>hell cares and you can wander through </v>
<v Speaker 1>life doing whatever you want,</v>

92
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.600
<v Speaker 1>gratifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive desires for how useful that's </v>

93
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>going to be and you're stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaninglessness,</v>

94
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have any responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one do you want?</v>

95
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself which one are you pursuing?</v>

96
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.010
<v Speaker 1>And you'll find very rapidly that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the majority of your soul that's </v>

97
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.911
<v Speaker 1>pursuing the whole meaning thing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look what you have to do to do </v>

98
00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:15.290
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

99
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Have to take on the fact that life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and you have put yourself </v>

100
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 1>together in the face of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

101
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 1>that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

102
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:25.060
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can even do it.</v>

103
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm stunned every day when I go outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't a route a riot with </v>

104
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 1>everything burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can really.</v>

105
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talked to people.</v>

106
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:38.971
<v Speaker 1>It's like I knew this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd been in a motorcycle accident and </v>

107
00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 1>it really ruined him and he was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>linesman,</v>

108
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:45.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on the power and he was working </v>

109
00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:47.311
<v Speaker 1>with someone who had Parkinson's disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had complimentary inadequacies </v>

110
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.950
<v Speaker 1>and so two of them could do the job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one person and so they're out there </v>

111
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.761
<v Speaker 1>fixing power lines in the freezing cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that one was three </v>

112
00:05:56.761 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>quarters erect with motorcycle accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one had Parkinson's.</v>

113
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's how our civilization </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

114
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's all these ruled people</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

115
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 1>They've got problems like you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe off.</v>

116
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 1>They go to work and do things they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even like and look,</v>

117
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:12.620
<v Speaker 1>the lights are on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My God.</v>

118
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

119
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a miracle and we're so ungrateful.</v>

120
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 1>College students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the postmodern types,</v>

121
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>they're so ungrateful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>they don't know that they're surrounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>by just a bloody miracle.</v>

123
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a miracle that all this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>

124
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>but all you crazy chimpanzees that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know each other can sit in the same room</v>

125
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:37.391
<v Speaker 1>for two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweltering away without tearing each </v>

126
00:06:37.391 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 1>other apart because that's what chimps </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

127
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

128
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.190
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happened?</v>

129
00:06:47.191 --> 00:06:52.191
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made some videos and I got to the </v>

130
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:52.191
<v Speaker 1>bottom of some things at least as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell.</v>

131
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:57.111
<v Speaker 1>So I told you what the bottom is and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I got this idea about what you </v>

132
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:57.690
<v Speaker 1>might do about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't my idea.</v>

133
00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an old,</v>

134
00:07:00.121 --> 00:07:00.840
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

135
00:07:00.841 --> 00:07:03.270
<v Speaker 1>old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's far older than Christianity.</v>

136
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.180
<v Speaker 1>It's old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the oldest story of mankind.</v>

137
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Get yourself together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcend your suffering.</v>

138
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.650
<v Speaker 1>See if you can be some kind of hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make the suffering in the world less.</v>

139
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way forward as far as I can </v>

140
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is any way forward.</v>

141
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Knots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's under assault by the </v>

142
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.461
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so look out because they know exactly </v>

143
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:29.910
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing and they know exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they're doing it.</v>
