1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing about marriage,</v>

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:07.001
<v Speaker 1>this is really worth knowing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I learned this in part from </v>

3
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.331
<v Speaker 1>reading youngest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what do you do when you get </v>

4
00:00:10.331 --> 00:00:10.331
<v Speaker 1>married?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's easy.</v>

5
00:00:10.331 --> 00:00:12.200
<v Speaker 1>You take someone who's just as useless </v>
<v Speaker 1>and horrible as you are,</v>

6
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.090
<v Speaker 1>and then you shackle yourself to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you say,</v>

7
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.440
<v Speaker 1>we're not running away no matter what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

8
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's perfect because then you </v>

9
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.950
<v Speaker 1>don't get to run away and the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like if you can run away,</v>

10
00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:32.951
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell each other the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you tell someone the truth </v>

11
00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:36.371
<v Speaker 1>about you and they don't run away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't listening and so if you </v>

12
00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Speaker 1>don't have someone around that can't run</v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

13
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>then you can't tell them the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's part of the purpose of the</v>

14
00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:40.820
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

15
00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:41.540
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

16
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll bet on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You bet on me.</v>

17
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:45.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a losing bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both know that,</v>

18
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:49.070
<v Speaker 1>but given our current circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're unlikely to find anyone better.</v>

19
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.880
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

20
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Two things that come off of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is you know,</v>

21
00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.870
<v Speaker 1>people are waiting around to find Mr and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mrs.</v>

22
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

23
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.120
<v Speaker 1>here's something to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

24
00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>to put yourself on your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>If you went to a party and you found Mr </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wright and he looked at you and didn't </v>

26
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.011
<v Speaker 1>run away screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would indicate that he wasn't Mr </v>

27
00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:12.011
<v Speaker 1>Wright at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

28
00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:15.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like the old Nietzschean joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone loves you,</v>

29
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.630
<v Speaker 1>that should immediately disenchanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

30
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

31
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Or it's the woody Allen joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never belonged to a club that would </v>

32
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 1>take me as a member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

33
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.050
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting thing to think</v>

35
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:33.581
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're going to shackle yourself </v>

36
00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:35.300
<v Speaker 1>to someone who's just as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperfect as you are.</v>

37
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.900
<v Speaker 1>And then the issue is you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

38
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.160
<v Speaker 1>you might be in a situation where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can actually negotiate because you might</v>

39
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:44.000
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

40
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.910
<v Speaker 1>there's some things about you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't going so right.</v>

41
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.250
<v Speaker 1>And there's some things about me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't going so right and we're bloody </v>

42
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.680
<v Speaker 1>well stuck with the consequences for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next 50 years.</v>

43
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 1>So we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can either straighten this out or we </v>

44
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>can suffer through it for the next five </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

45
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are of the sort that without that</v>

46
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:03.440
<v Speaker 1>degree of seriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those problems will not be solved.</v>

47
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.040
<v Speaker 1>You'll leave things unnamed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always an out.</v>

48
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:11.041
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same thing when you're </v>

49
00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:12.641
<v Speaker 1>living together with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that people who live together </v>

50
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:12.641
<v Speaker 1>before they're married are more likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get divorced,</v>

51
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>not less likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

52
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>what exactly are you saying to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another when you live with each other?</v>

53
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Just think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.050
<v Speaker 1>for now you're better than anything else</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can trick,</v>

55
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>but I'd like to reserve the right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade you in conveniently.</v>

56
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.820
<v Speaker 1>If someone happens to stumble into me,</v>

57
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 2>well how can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can ?</v>

58
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 2>Someone</v>

59
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>not be insulted to their core by an </v>
<v Speaker 1>offer like that.</v>

60
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Now they're willing to play along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because they're going to do the same </v>

61
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.480
<v Speaker 1>thing with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will.</v>

62
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.480
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

63
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

64
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I know you're not going to commit to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means you don't value me or our </v>

65
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>relationship above everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as long as I get to escape,</v>

66
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>if I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm willing to put up with that.</v>

67
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a hell of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:12.481
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how stupid is it to shackle yourself to </v>

69
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:12.481
<v Speaker 1>someone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

70
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:12.481
<v Speaker 1>it's stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

71
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but compared to the alternatives,</v>

72
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty damn good because without </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shackling,</v>

73
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>there are things you will never ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned because you'll avoid them.</v>

74
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>You can always leave and if you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave,</v>

75
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to tell each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>

76
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.290
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>just leave and then you don't have </v>

77
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.290
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell the truth too.</v>
