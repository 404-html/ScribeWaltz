1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with lots of people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorders,</v>

2
00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:07.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one thing about people who have </v>

3
00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:07.491
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorders is they are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>mysterious to me.</v>

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no problem for me to understand why</v>

5
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:16.731
<v Speaker 1>people have anxiety disorders or why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're depressed or why they have </v>

6
00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>substance use problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mystery to me is always white people</v>

7
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:24.201
<v Speaker 1>don't have all of those things at once </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody has a reason to be </v>

8
00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

9
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:29.421
<v Speaker 1>we have the ultimate reason to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious because we know that we're </v>

10
00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:32.601
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable and we know that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to die and how you can not be anxious </v>

11
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>under those circumstances is a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystery.</v>

12
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a massive mystery and that same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing applies with regards to depression</v>

13
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>and then the same thing applies to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree with regards to drug and alcohol </v>

14
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said last week,</v>

15
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of reasons to drown your </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and alcohol.</v>

16
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.860
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could refer to the aforementioned </v>

17
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.441
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and depression not least and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the and the sorts of drugs that </v>

18
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:59.871
<v Speaker 1>people are prone to take our chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 1>that take the effect of edge off the </v>

19
00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>tragedy of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

20
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>so back to back to the issue of of of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>

21
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Being Abraham is self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this commentary says,</v>

22
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is as he moves forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite that,</v>

23
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>he's self conscious and he knows the </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger,</v>

24
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 1>but he moves forward despite that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually the appropriate response</v>

25
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>in the face of actual non naive </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what constitutes life.</v>

26
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're naive and you move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

27
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:32.451
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there's no courage in naivety </v>

29
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know what there is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop you.</v>

30
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what dangers you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>apprehend,</v>

31
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>but to be aware of what it is that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is.</v>

32
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>So to be alert existentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

33
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:47.151
<v Speaker 1>or to be fully self conscious means that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're perfectly aware of your </v>

34
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:50.481
<v Speaker 1>limitations and how you might be hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then to make the decision to move </v>

35
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>forward into the unknown and the land of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stranger.</v>

36
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>

37
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's one of the secrets to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good life and I can say that really </v>

38
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>without fear of contradiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would I would say because the clinical</v>

39
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>literature on this is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

40
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:08.121
<v Speaker 1>very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do with people who are afraid </v>

41
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>and to some degree depressed but </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly anxious,</v>

42
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>is you lay out what what they're anxious</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

43
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>first of all in detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it that you're afraid of?</v>

44
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:19.491
<v Speaker 1>What might happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you decompose it into small </v>

45
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>

46
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:24.951
<v Speaker 1>manageable problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the person expose </v>

47
00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>themselves to the thing that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of.</v>

48
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And what happens isn't that they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>less afraid.</v>

49
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what the clinical literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates.</v>

50
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:35.751
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens instead is they get braver </v>

51
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:35.751
<v Speaker 1>and that's not the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Because if it get less afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

53
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world isn't as dangerous as I </v>

54
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 1>thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

55
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 1>silly me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get braver,</v>

56
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 1>that's not what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is,</v>

57
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:48.231
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the World Damn worlds just as dangerous </v>

58
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:48.231
<v Speaker 1>as I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's even more dangerous than I</v>

59
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:52.641
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out that there's something </v>

60
00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:54.681
<v Speaker 1>in me that responds to taking that on as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a voluntary challenge and grows and </v>

61
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:56.990
<v Speaker 1>thrives as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no doubt about this.</v>

62
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Even the psychophysiological findings </v>
<v Speaker 1>are quite clear if you,</v>

63
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.600
<v Speaker 1>if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you impose a stressor on two groups </v>

64
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.011
<v Speaker 1>of people and on one group the stressor </v>
<v Speaker 1>is imposed involuntarily and on the </v>

65
00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>other group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stressor is picked up voluntarily.</v>

66
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.200
<v Speaker 1>The people who pick up the stress or </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary voluntarily use a whole </v>

67
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>different cycle physiological system to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with it.</v>

68
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.500
<v Speaker 1>They use the system that's associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with approach and challenge and not the </v>

69
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.221
<v Speaker 1>system that's a pro associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive aggression and withdrawal and </v>

70
00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:31.110
<v Speaker 1>the system that is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges,</v>

71
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.120
<v Speaker 1>much more associated with positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion and much less associated with </v>

72
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.991
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also much less hard on you because </v>

73
00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>the defensive posturing system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prey animal system,</v>

74
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that thing kicks in,</v>

75
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:48.271
<v Speaker 1>it's all systems are go for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're the gas is pushed down </v>

76
00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:52.531
<v Speaker 1>to the pedal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pushed down to the metal and the </v>

77
00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:54.631
<v Speaker 1>brakes are on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're using future resources that you </v>

78
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>could be storing for future time right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now in the present to ready yourself for</v>

79
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:58.590
<v Speaker 1>emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

80
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing simple or trivial at all</v>

81
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:06.181
<v Speaker 1>about the idea of being called to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forthrightly forward into this strange </v>

82
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>and the unknown and there's a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure that's associated with that,</v>

83
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

84
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's an exciting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the reason why people </v>

85
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.611
<v Speaker 1>travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also to see yourself as the </v>

86
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:20.191
<v Speaker 1>sort of creature that can do that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to do that on a habitual basis </v>

87
00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 1>is also the right kind of tonic for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate this word for yourself.</v>

88
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>because the self esteem has nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with feeling good about yourself.</v>

90
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 1>As a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I already mentioned,</v>

91
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>there isn't necessarily reason why a </v>
<v Speaker 1>priority.</v>

92
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>You should just feel good about </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

93
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:39.931
<v Speaker 1>but if you can view yourself acting in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous and forthright manner and </v>

94
00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:44.761
<v Speaker 1>encountering the world and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve your lot and and and taking </v>

95
00:04:44.761 --> 00:04:44.770
<v Speaker 1>risks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.800
<v Speaker 1>in a non naive way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you have something that you </v>

97
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.291
<v Speaker 1>can comfort yourself with at night when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wondering what the whole damn </v>

98
00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:56.281
<v Speaker 1>point out of your few tiled and </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable life and so and that's </v>

99
00:04:56.281 --> 00:05:01.141
<v Speaker 1>necessary because it's often the case </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you wake up at four in the morning </v>

100
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:05.521
<v Speaker 1>or at least sometimes the case that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wake up at four in the morning when </v>

101
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:08.491
<v Speaker 1>things haven't been going that well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder just what the hell the point is </v>

102
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 1>of your futile and miserable life.</v>

103
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>You have to have something real to set </v>
<v Speaker 1>against that.</v>

104
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:16.771
<v Speaker 1>It can't be just rationalizations about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you know you're a valuable person </v>

105
00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>among others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though that's true,</v>

106
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:22.711
<v Speaker 1>that's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need something that's more </v>

107
00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:25.591
<v Speaker 1>realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To set a against that and observing </v>

108
00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:28.560
<v Speaker 1>courage in yourself is definitely one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that that that could help you</v>

109
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>sleep soundly at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

110
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>when things are destabilized a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit around you.</v>
