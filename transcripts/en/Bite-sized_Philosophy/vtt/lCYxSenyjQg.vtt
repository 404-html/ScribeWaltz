00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.990
<v Speaker 1>For a long time I understood nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

2
00:00:02.991 --> 00:00:07.991
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could understand its rationale </v>

3
00:00:07.991 --> 00:00:11.020
<v Speaker 1>associated with the tragedy of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>associating with suffering and evil </v>

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.130
<v Speaker 1>associated with the observation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>finitude and the arbitrary and unjust </v>

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.910
<v Speaker 1>nature of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more I've thought about it,</v>

6
00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>the less I've come to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's any excuse for it whatsoever,</v>

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.040
<v Speaker 1>and I think the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it forestalls effort.</v>

8
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>It forestalls the ability to discover </v>
<v Speaker 1>for yourself maybe there's no reason to </v>

9
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:36.440
<v Speaker 1>be so God damn hopeless except that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier to be useless now,</v>

10
00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>

11
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:42.521
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making that case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that that's what's be </v>

12
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:45.050
<v Speaker 1>setting people who are clinically </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>

13
00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:47.090
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not my point.</v>

14
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Clinical depression is a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of reasons to be rendered </v>

15
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be tossed into a catastrophic </v>

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what I mean.</v>

17
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean that kind of cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogant,</v>

18
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.390
<v Speaker 1>rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper-intelligent nihilism that throws </v>

19
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.081
<v Speaker 1>the world away as if it's of little use </v>
<v Speaker 1>before it's been properly engaged with</v>

20
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.640
<v Speaker 1>better to engage with it and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens and better to make the </v>

21
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>assumption that if the world isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>returning to you,</v>

22
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 1>what it is that you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then either you're not doing it right or</v>

23
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 1>you've conceptualized what you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly.</v>

24
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Why not at least open yourself up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that possibility,</v>

25
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you could be wrong.</v>

26
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully if you're suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a great thing to know.</v>

27
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully if you're suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong,</v>

28
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.800
<v Speaker 1>because if you're suffering and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

29
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>then there's nowhere to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's very useful to find out whatever</v>

30
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:52.181
<v Speaker 1>errors you might be committing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that's really interesting </v>

31
00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:53.000
<v Speaker 1>about the Jews in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a remarkable thing.</v>

32
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Every single time they get flattened by </v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

33
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>it's always their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never say,</v>

34
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>the world that God created was corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and God is evil.</v>

35
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>They never say that no matter what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>

36
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what catastrophe occurs,</v>

37
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>when they have every reason to at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>put that hypothesis forward,</v>

38
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

39
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>we aired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we walked off the path,</v>

40
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>it's our fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's hard,</v>

41
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:27.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it puts all the weight of human </v>

42
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:27.141
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe on the human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very hard,</v>

43
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>but the upside is</v>

44
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 1>it gives you the control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It opens up the door that it opens up </v>

45
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>the possibility that you could be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that could set it right.</v>

46
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>If you would just let go of what's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your way,</v>

47
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.670
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>
