1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Where you have to remember when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch something like this movie,</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.910
<v Speaker 1>not a single bit of it is random or </v>
<v Speaker 1>occidental,</v>

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>none of it because you know they had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>draw,</v>

4
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how many frames per </v>
<v Speaker 1>second these things are 30,</v>

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a little less than that,</v>

6
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:18.711
<v Speaker 1>but it's high quality automation and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone had to paint 30 pictures to get </v>

7
00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>a second of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing that accidentally.</v>

8
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:26.301
<v Speaker 1>It's really expensive and everyone has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to agree on exactly what's going to </v>

9
00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>happen and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

10
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>do the people who are doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously know what they're doing?</v>

11
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>And that answer of that is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of just like you do,</v>

12
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>you know it's yes they know and no they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't and they know because they're </v>

13
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>really smart and gifted and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know because it's not all</v>

14
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>articulated.</v>

15
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Plus they're working in a group so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>know and don't know just like you do </v>

16
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>when you're watching it and so and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do anything else.</v>

17
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.250
<v Speaker 1>So now they're also guided by what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might call.</v>

18
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>They're guided by their unconscious in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the in the Friday and and in the </v>

19
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.631
<v Speaker 1>cognitive way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because your unconscious value </v>

20
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:06.171
<v Speaker 1>structures determine the direction and </v>
<v Speaker 1>content of your perceptions and so it's </v>

21
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:10.221
<v Speaker 1>built right into the way you move your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes because you tend to look at things </v>

22
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>you value right or things you're afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

23
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:16.881
<v Speaker 1>like you look at things with valence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the decision about what has </v>

24
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>value is dependent on the implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of your moral system,</v>

25
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:24.891
<v Speaker 1>your purse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because morality is about what's good </v>

26
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:26.961
<v Speaker 1>and what isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's been partly a conscious </v>

27
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>construction of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's partly something you've been.</v>

28
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>You've picked up by interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like mad ever since you were </v>

29
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>

30
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 1>You don't know all the rules anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the damn cricket did.</v>

31
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>You just don't and you can't because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too complicated,</v>

32
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>but you act them out and then you also </v>
<v Speaker 1>have representations of how people act </v>

33
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>in your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dreams are.</v>

34
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>That's what a dream is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a fantasy is.</v>

35
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.600
<v Speaker 1>That's what that little movie that plays</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside your head when you remember what </v>

36
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>you did is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you only remember the just you know,</v>

37
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>so even the the images stick </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of your behavior in your </v>

38
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically your episodic memory.</v>

39
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.020
<v Speaker 1>It's already selecting and molding and </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning it into a relatable story.</v>

40
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.470
<v Speaker 1>It can't help but do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only way you can represent it </v>

41
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>and so you don't know how you do that or</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you do that,</v>

42
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:18.501
<v Speaker 1>but part of it's governed by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit morality that's part of your </v>

43
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:22.550
<v Speaker 1>procedural memory system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the way you act and part of the </v>

44
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.161
<v Speaker 1>way you move your eyes and listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and focus on them and that's all </v>

45
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>been instantiated inside of you because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this immense social,</v>

46
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.450
<v Speaker 1>your biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also this immense social project </v>

47
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>that you're continually engaged in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that informs what you remembered.</v>

48
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.470
<v Speaker 1>It informs what you imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It informs what we collectively </v>

49
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.071
<v Speaker 1>imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It informs what we can collectively </v>

50
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>understand and partly what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:48.471
<v Speaker 1>you become conscious of yourself is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>map the implicit structures that already</v>

52
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>constitute you from society into </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicit representation.</v>

53
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.750
<v Speaker 1>That's what self understanding means and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you have that moment of </v>

54
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.381
<v Speaker 1>insight about you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're watching your this </v>

55
00:03:03.381 --> 00:03:07.020
<v Speaker 1>repetitive behavior that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested probably that got you in </v>

56
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's your characteristic way of</v>

57
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>falling accidentally into chaos and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about your problems.</v>

58
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:16.801
<v Speaker 1>You talk about them with your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk about them and maybe you have </v>

59
00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:19.741
<v Speaker 1>dreams about them and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to relate them and you </v>

60
00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:22.171
<v Speaker 1>have memories about them that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of because they're negatively </v>

61
00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:24.871
<v Speaker 1>tones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you talk about them and then someone </v>

62
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.151
<v Speaker 1>comes up with a little statement that </v>
<v Speaker 1>links them together causally and you </v>

63
00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:27.151
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

64
00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm doing.</v>

65
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you can stop doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least,</v>

66
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.020
<v Speaker 1>or at least maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can think of some strategies </v>

67
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>for not doing it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not like,</v>

68
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're acting it out.</v>

69
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>You know it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But until that's all,</v>

70
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 1>until the representation matches that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern,</v>

71
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>that click of insight doesn't occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's like a revelation.</v>

72
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because the knowledge is there and </v>

73
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>it's implicit forum and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>bang.</v>

74
00:03:56.591 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>It's been made explicit as a fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe or also as a,</v>

75
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>as a set of semantic statements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

76
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.640
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a crush on someone and you </v>

77
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.651
<v Speaker 1>don't notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you find yourself having a </v>

78
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:10.651
<v Speaker 1>fantasy about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Think,</v>

79
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:14.041
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means something that indicates </v>

80
00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:17.761
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't want him to know that </v>

81
00:04:17.761 --> 00:04:17.761
<v Speaker 1>that's what you want.</v>

82
00:04:17.761 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>But the fantasy will tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you suggested,</v>

83
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>and this is sort of out of the Freudian </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition of free associations,</v>

84
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:29.821
<v Speaker 1>is watch yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch your fantasies because they're </v>

85
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>always happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

86
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.330
<v Speaker 1>and they'll tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I do when,</v>

87
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.930
<v Speaker 1>when I'm interacting with my clients is </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have a discussion and then they'll</v>

88
00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:41.931
<v Speaker 1>let their eyes will drift a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll know that there are somethings </v>

89
00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:42.380
<v Speaker 1>flitted through their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

90
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.980
<v Speaker 1>And that means we've touched on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that has multiple,</v>

91
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 1>a multiplicity of elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I'll stop and say,</v>

92
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:51.100
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that you maybe you tear it up,</v>

93
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing to really watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

94
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:57.571
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you laugh or you drifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least it's like it's because some </v>

95
00:04:57.571 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>other thought has entered your field of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

96
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 1>And then if you can get the person to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grab those thoughts to notice them,</v>

97
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.010
<v Speaker 1>then you can often figure out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>avenues along which that particular </v>

98
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 1>conversation might unfold.</v>

99
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a union complex or a </v>

100
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's an emotional core that</v>

101
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 1>produces a whole range of associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and that thing's got a life.</v>

102
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:24.061
<v Speaker 1>It's like a micro personality and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have resentment and it might have </v>

103
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:27.751
<v Speaker 1>anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often negative emotion tinge </v>

104
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:30.600
<v Speaker 1>because the negative emotion tinge to </v>
<v Speaker 1>episodes are still problems and they </v>

105
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:36.210
<v Speaker 1>will emerge automatically because your </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat detection systems force them onto</v>

106
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you watch and where when you drift,</v>

107
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.570
<v Speaker 1>you will drift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fantasy is partly a </v>

108
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.821
<v Speaker 1>representation of the problem space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that happens when you wake up </v>

109
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>at three in the morning and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about things,</v>

110
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because actually what happens is you </v>

111
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.831
<v Speaker 1>wake up during threat processing and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're depressed actually that gets so </v>

112
00:05:55.831 --> 00:06:00.181
<v Speaker 1>intense you can't sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you just lay there all night </v>

113
00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:00.181
<v Speaker 1>worrying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fun,</v>

114
00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 1>and those are fantasies about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative elements of your past,</v>

115
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:08.171
<v Speaker 1>present and future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fantasies can also breed </v>

116
00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:08.171
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>

117
00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why Freud regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams as wish fulfillments.</v>

118
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 1>It's partly that and he wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was where he stopped.</v>

119
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partially correct.</v>

120
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:24.401
<v Speaker 1>It's like the fantasy will provide you </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a problem and a potential solution,</v>

121
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>but they're more like problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification mechanisms.</v>

122
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.160
<v Speaker 1>The fantasies with the possibility of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution built in and so a way of </v>

123
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:39.251
<v Speaker 1>thinking about that is that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>generate potential futures so they're </v>

124
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:45.200
<v Speaker 1>like each segregated environments </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the rules of your fantasy.</v>

125
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Then you can generate little avatars of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself that didn't have at each of </v>

126
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.351
<v Speaker 1>those little universes and you can run </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as simulations and then you can </v>

127
00:06:53.351 --> 00:06:57.251
<v Speaker 1>watch what happens in the simulation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a catastrophe then you don't </v>

128
00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 1>have to act it out and that's exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly.</v>

129
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 1>That's akin to what you're doing when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go watch a movie,</v>

130
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>except that is much more coherent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>well thought through,</v>

131
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then than just a dream which is </v>

132
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 1>often quite fragmentary.</v>

133
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because the dream is </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to sacrifice coherence to play </v>

134
00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 1>with category structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:22.601
<v Speaker 1>and that's why in dreams things can </v>
<v Speaker 1>change from one thing into another </v>

136
00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 1>really weirdly or scenes can change from</v>
<v Speaker 1>one scene to another without a logic.</v>

137
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.710
<v Speaker 1>The logic gets loosened so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of your thinking can widen </v>

138
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

139
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:36.390
<v Speaker 1>it's dangerous to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why you do it when </v>

140
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.390
<v Speaker 1>you're asleep and paralyzed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.090
<v Speaker 1>you don't run around and act out your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your suit,</v>

142
00:07:40.091 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>a puddle fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:43.580
<v Speaker 1>where you're stretching yourself out </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the world.</v>

144
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.990
<v Speaker 1>There's no risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

145
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it can be bad enough,</v>

146
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:48.450
<v Speaker 1>so you'll wake up in terror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>but that's better than being in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodile's mouth by a large margin.</v>
