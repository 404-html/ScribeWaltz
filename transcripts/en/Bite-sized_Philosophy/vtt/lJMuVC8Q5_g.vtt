1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>People aren't taught that comparing what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to.</v>

2
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:07.680
<v Speaker 1>They're hypothetical politically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.370
<v Speaker 1>ideologically motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Utopia is actually a bad idea,</v>

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>it just isn't difficult to take a look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a system like our system and say,</v>

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all the problems that has </v>

7
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>compared to a hypothetical system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any problems at all.</v>

8
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

9
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:25.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's problems,</v>

10
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:31.221
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've taken like 99 percent of the fish </v>

12
00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:31.880
<v Speaker 1>out of the ocean and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

13
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.890
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which our current level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic activity is truly sustainable </v>

14
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>without alteration is at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>debatable.</v>

15
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Even though I don't think it's nearly as</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible as people make out,</v>

16
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:46.821
<v Speaker 1>make it out to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think it's disputable that </v>

17
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.950
<v Speaker 1>our current socioeconomic structures are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most productive and the most free </v>

18
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>structures that have ever been produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>by people anywhere in the world.</v>

19
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you can say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism and free enterprise and and </v>

20
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>the western stress on individuality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that even though it does produce </v>

21
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.921
<v Speaker 1>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a all systems producing inequality and </v>

22
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:14.061
<v Speaker 1>and without any real distinction between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right and the left by the wayside </v>

23
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:17.971
<v Speaker 1>because I'm so new book called the Great</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leveler by Walter Shadelle,</v>

24
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>who I'm going to be talking to later </v>
<v Speaker 1>this month,</v>

25
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>he did an analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empirical analysis trying to figure out </v>

26
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you grouped governments by right wing</v>

27
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.710
<v Speaker 1>philosophy say or by left wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and then you calculated </v>

28
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Speaker 1>inequality coefficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would that left wing organizations be </v>

29
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>characterized by reduced inequality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer was no.</v>

30
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence that they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that points to,</v>

31
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:48.621
<v Speaker 1>and this is something very fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a far more fundamental than than </v>

32
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:52.681
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that inequality is the rule in </v>

33
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:55.260
<v Speaker 1>cooperative slash competitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>

34
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>You can't positive value without </v>
<v Speaker 1>producing a hierarchy,</v>

35
00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

36
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Because you paused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it devalues,</v>

37
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.370
<v Speaker 1>say this is worth doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone says,</v>

38
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is worth doing well.</v>

39
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Then what happens automatically is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that some people are better</v>

40
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>at doing it than other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what it is,</v>

41
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll get better and better </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it,</v>

42
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>like the Credo principle you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about too,</v>

43
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>and then they start getting better at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

44
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is is that without you </v>
<v Speaker 1>with if you're going to positive value,</v>

45
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:24.261
<v Speaker 1>which you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to act and immediately </v>

46
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>you create a hierarchy and you also </v>
<v Speaker 1>build into the value claim,</v>

47
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.800
<v Speaker 1>the claim that a is better than b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also built into that the idea that </v>

48
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.320
<v Speaker 1>if a is better than B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than people who are doing better at a </v>

49
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>should be differentially rewarded </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to people who who aren't.</v>

50
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.790
<v Speaker 1>There's no way around that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to play the game and so you're </v>

51
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.640
<v Speaker 1>stuck with inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there isn't any evidence that that </v>

52
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>social engineering policies are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good at dispensing with inequality,</v>

53
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>which is a fundamental political problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no one really knows what to do about</v>

54
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but criticizing the entire society.</v>

55
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about the west,</v>

56
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>and this is increasingly true all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

57
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:06.931
<v Speaker 1>is that it's generating our approach </v>
<v Speaker 1>generates a tremendous amount of wealth </v>

58
00:03:06.931 --> 00:03:06.931
<v Speaker 1>for ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

59
00:03:06.931 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>it even happened in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>despite their exceptionally totalitarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>leanings.</v>

61
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens with the lefties is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they say,</v>

62
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:21.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality as a consequence of the west </v>

63
00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>and the consequences of capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is palpably false claim and say,</v>

64
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it produces inequality,</v>

65
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>then it's a corrupt system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

66
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every system produces inequality,</v>

67
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>but hardly any also produce wealth.</v>
