1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.300
<v Speaker 1>In some ways it's the women that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>embracing the masculine archetype in </v>

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>some ways that are being successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're.</v>

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:08.180
<v Speaker 1>They're being extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible and they're.</v>

4
00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>They're feeling a lot of these positions</v>
<v Speaker 1>quicker than men can.</v>

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're and they're graduating at</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher rates of college and they're </v>

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.011
<v Speaker 1>declining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're declining motherhood or they're </v>

7
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:19.011
<v Speaker 1>at least suspending it throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>

8
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>which is you could argue for either </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

9
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>There's reasons for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess my question is,</v>

10
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the expression of the </v>

11
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>masculine spirit in women isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>denigrated,</v>

12
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>like women don't get accused of </v>
<v Speaker 1>contributing to the patriarchy even when</v>

13
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:36.531
<v Speaker 1>they take positions in society that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would think are fully patriarchal now </v>

14
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:41.601
<v Speaker 1>and which is a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women who go to law school and then </v>

15
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>and then practice as corporate lawyers </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

16
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>aren't subject to the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you call it?</v>

17
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Claim that their activity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitating that.</v>

18
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>The decline of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess because they're seen as well,</v>

19
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:59.331
<v Speaker 1>they're there because of their gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose they're seen as as as leaders </v>

20
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>of the rebellion against the patriarchal</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit.</v>

21
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Even though structurally it boils down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the same thing,</v>

22
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that masculine,</v>

23
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 1>classically masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolically masculine,</v>

24
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.170
<v Speaker 1>yearning for hierarchical productivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and competition is rewarded in women but</v>

25
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:21.021
<v Speaker 1>not in men and which is also a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>perverse thing because it doesn't make </v>

26
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:25.251
<v Speaker 1>any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense through the </v>

27
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.441
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is they're just undoing the </v>

28
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:27.441
<v Speaker 1>oppressor ship of the man and the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

29
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:29.880
<v Speaker 1>hundred 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the ends justify the means.</v>

30
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:34.881
<v Speaker 1>That's the way they look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever power women can take from men </v>

31
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way they look at it.</v>

32
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a funny thing about that too,</v>

33
00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>that like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read this in 12 rules for life.</v>

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at some of the Pew </v>
<v Speaker 1>Research Data and I don't remember the </v>

35
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>figures precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but over the last 15 years,</v>

36
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.090
<v Speaker 1>the percentage of women who young women </v>
<v Speaker 1>who claim that they would like to be </v>

37
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>married in a permanent relationship has </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone up a substantial amount.</v>

38
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 50 percent approximately springs to </v>

39
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot at the same time.</v>

40
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>It's declined almost the same degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>among young men and so what's.</v>

41
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>What's perverse about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something I've talked to my </v>

42
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.421
<v Speaker 1>daughter a fair a bit about is that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean if you ask young women what they </v>

43
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:22.131
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they can answer because </v>

44
00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they know if they're 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>or 20 because I think their heads are so</v>

45
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 1>muddled by what they've been told that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't really know,</v>

46
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>but my sense is that women want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to develop their career in </v>

47
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 1>whatever direction they see fit and fair</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

48
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.540
<v Speaker 1>but they want an intimate relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>and usually a monogamous one that's </v>

49
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.891
<v Speaker 1>permanent and they want to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to have kids and what you </v>

50
00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:42.891
<v Speaker 1>see happening.</v>

51
00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Inevitably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I believe this to be the case.</v>

52
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:49.881
<v Speaker 1>I've watched very carefully as I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've grown up and got older because </v>

53
00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I've worked with women my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that women are less,</v>

54
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.790
<v Speaker 1>are less compelled by their career as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they approach their thirties and more </v>

55
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.531
<v Speaker 1>compelled by the desire to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanent relationship and biological </v>

56
00:03:03.531 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue to.</v>

57
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

58
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

59
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a biological necessity because </v>

60
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>women have to have children relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

61
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.310
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's interesting to watch it </v>

62
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.560
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologically and even the women </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've seen who've had very high </v>

63
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>powered careers is that as they move </v>
<v Speaker 1>into their,</v>

64
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>especially their early thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start to realize that the career is</v>

65
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>a pretty one dimensional enterprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's a good career,</v>

66
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>because even good careers are still jobs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and good careers.</v>

67
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>They're also very hard jobs.</v>

68
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>They're like 70 hour a week jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're full bore commitment jobs and to</v>

69
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to have a career like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and to have a life,</v>

70
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 1>to have a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have an intimate relationship,</v>

71
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>to have children and then to also be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to take care of them.</v>

72
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a very complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

73
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>that's a very complex job to manage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what's strange is,</v>

74
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I think what's strange is that the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that the radicals are undermining</v>

75
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.270
<v Speaker 1>the monogamous family are actually those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that women most want,</v>

76
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>especially as they approach their </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties.</v>

77
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.060
<v Speaker 1>And so this is a catastrophe on both </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends of the,</v>

78
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>of the gender distribution.</v>
