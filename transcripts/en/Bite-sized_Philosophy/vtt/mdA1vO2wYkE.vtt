00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way to find your true passion</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is that just a cliche,</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.830
<v Speaker 1>was definitely a cliche and it and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.040
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the sort of thing that actually </v>

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.081
<v Speaker 1>annoys me quite a lot about new age </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers and I would more or less put </v>

5
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Campbell in that category.</v>

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I think you can find what compels you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what might enable you to live in a </v>

8
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>high quality manner despite the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering that's associated with life.</v>

9
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:37.281
<v Speaker 1>I think you can discover that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think part of the way you discover that </v>

10
00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:40.430
<v Speaker 1>is by watching yourself and learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it is that you're meaningfully </v>

11
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>engaged.</v>

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>You have to notice that it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens to you in some sense rather</v>

13
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:53.921
<v Speaker 1>than something that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to notice when you're </v>

14
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:57.460
<v Speaker 1>meaningfully engaged and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work to expand the amount of time </v>

15
00:00:57.801 --> 00:01:02.801
<v Speaker 1>that you spend in that state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would also say that there are </v>

16
00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>moral requirements that go along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that too because you might say,</v>

17
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:10.091
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you happen to be the sort of </v>

18
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:10.091
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

19
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 1>who finds torturing small animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningfully engaging?</v>

20
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that's a,</v>

21
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of meaningful engagement</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you probably don't want to expand.</v>

22
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>set up your life so that you maximize </v>

23
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.090
<v Speaker 1>your meaningful engagement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>

24
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a number of other things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do at the same time.</v>

25
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.780
<v Speaker 1>And one of those is that you have to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>very clear about who you are and what </v>

26
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:40.151
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so although this would be grounds </v>

27
00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:43.301
<v Speaker 1>for a much longer discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that one of the things that you </v>

28
00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>have to do if you're going to attempt to</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximize,</v>

29
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:50.351
<v Speaker 1>make meaningful engagement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you also have to do such things </v>

30
00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:50.351
<v Speaker 1>as</v>

31
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

32
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>endeavor to stop deceiving yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people in every way you possibly </v>

33
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.511
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that is that </v>

34
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:06.081
<v Speaker 1>if you engage in deception of any sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pathologize the structure first,</v>

35
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.170
<v Speaker 1>the structure of your being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could say you pathologize the </v>

36
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>structure of your nervous system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can't trust it's reports.</v>

37
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.390
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to rely on your nervous </v>

38
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.031
<v Speaker 1>system's reports of meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 1>engagement to guide your future </v>

39
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better do everything you can to make</v>

40
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:32.271
<v Speaker 1>sure that you're not filling that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system with the kind of garbage </v>

41
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>that's going to make it malfunctioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>and giving again,</v>

42
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:37.971
<v Speaker 1>give you a false reports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that moving towards </v>

43
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>meaningful engagement has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with making truth,</v>

44
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:46.521
<v Speaker 1>your highest value because otherwise you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't trust yourself as your own guide </v>

45
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>in the Catholics have struggled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this for a long time from a theological </v>

46
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>perspective because the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

47
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.170
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that human beings are so steeped in </v>

48
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.901
<v Speaker 1>sin that they can't trust their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts in relationship to good and </v>

49
00:02:59.901 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>evil and have to use the church and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>priesthood as an intermediary.</v>

50
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can obviously have an argument about</v>

51
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>that and of course Protestants have </v>
<v Speaker 1>historically done that,</v>

52
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to give the Catholics </v>
<v Speaker 1>there do.</v>

53
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like people aren't pure by nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>and only traveled in their vision by </v>

54
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.760
<v Speaker 1>it'll sociological impediments there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also corrupt beyond belief individually </v>

55
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>and have to use society as a source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

56
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.720
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to personalize your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life in some sense,</v>

57
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>you better act in a manner that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you a reliable guide.</v>
