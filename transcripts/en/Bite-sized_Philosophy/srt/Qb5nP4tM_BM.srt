1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,220
You,
you might've heard about bf skinner,

2
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:07,221
you know,
he used food pellets to motivate his 

3
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:07,221
rats,
but what you don't know about skinner is

4
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:09,270
that those rats were starved to three 
quarters of their normal body weight.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,690
So they would,
they would work for food and so 

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,950
skinner's routes were kind of 
oversimplified,

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,440
but you can get rats to work for food.
They don't have to be that hungry.

8
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:21,510
You can get them to work for food and 
they'll do all sorts of things.

9
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:26,511
They'll press leavers and,
and they'll open our open doors and 

10
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:30,681
they'll solve problems and you know,
they'll do all sorts of things and one 

11
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:34,941
of the things you can do to kind of 
measure how much the rat is motivated 

12
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:35,250
is,
let's say you've run them through a maze

13
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:37,680
and he knows there's some food at the 
end of the maze.

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,370
You can tie a little spring to his tail 
and see how hard he polls when you 

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:43,370
opened the door to the maze.

16
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,530
So that's because that's how much rat 
work the route is willing to do.

17
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:51,531
So you can measure that or you can see 
how fast he skitters down in the maze 

18
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:54,831
and you can get an estimate about the 
rats motivation and so then you might 

19
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:57,270
say,
well how motivated is a hungry rat?

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,970
And the answer would be depends on how 
hungry is,

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,060
but there's another answer.
It also depends on what's chasing him 

22
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,911
when he's going after the food.
So if you have a rat and you have food 

23
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:11,970
over here and you walked in,
some cat older rats,

24
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,340
hate cat odor,
and it's innate.

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,200
They never have to see or smell acat to 
be absolutely petrified by cat odor.

26
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,740
And so if you walked in some cat odor 
and then opened the door,

27
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:26,100
that rat will zoom to that food a lot 
faster than it will if it's just hungry.

28
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,310
So a rat running away from something 
that it doesn't want toward something 

29
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,970
that it does want is a very motivated 
rat.

30
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,330
And so one of the things we did with the
future authoring program that's Germane 

31
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,140
to this idea of terror,
because there's a.

32
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,170
there's this idea in the Old Testament,
the fear of God is the beginning of 

33
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,870
wisdom and it's a pretty harsh idea,
but,

34
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,930
but there's something really useful 
about it because one of the things you 

35
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,721
see with people all the time is that 
there maybe they're trying to stumble 

36
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:57,240
forward towards their ideal as poorly 
defined as it might be,

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,760
but then they're afraid,
right?

38
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,880
They're afraid about what they might 
encounter and that stops them because 

39
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,370
fear does stop people.
It freezes you like a prey on them and 

40
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,000
so people move ahead,
but then they get afraid and then they 

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,711
start moving ahead and so,
and that's not so good because negative 

42
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:13,920
emotion is a really powerful motivator.

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,980
So we're more motivated by negative 
emotion than positive emotion.

44
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,660
Quantitatively speaking,
quantitative,

45
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:24,661
quantitatively speaking.
You can measure that and that's I think 

46
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:27,531
because we can only be so happy,
but we can really be suffering and 

47
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:27,531
death,
you know,

48
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:29,070
so we have to pay more attention to the 
negative.

49
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,350
And that's bad because the negative can 
stop you.

50
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,540
And then my clinical practice,
you know,

51
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,910
I often talk to people who are trying to
make a difficult life decision and,

52
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,220
and they are weighing out the costs and 
the benefits of making the life 

53
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:43,220
decisions,
you know,

54
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,900
and one of the things I always talk to 
them about is wait a second,

55
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:50,901
that's an incomplete analysis.
You have to weigh out the benefits and 

56
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:54,591
the costs of doing this and you have to 
weigh out the costs and benefits of not 

57
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,440
doing that,
not doing it.

58
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,500
And that's not the same as the zero that
you assume that you're with,

59
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,930
right?
Because to not make a decision,

60
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,260
it also has a cost and sometimes the 
cost of not making a decision is far 

61
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,500
worse than the cost of making a 
decision,

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,680
even if the decision is risky.
And so one of the things you can derive 

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:13,720
from that,
and this is very useful,

64
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,830
I think,
is that

65
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,310
this is also,
I think why it's so useful to 

66
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,310
contemplate your mortality,
so to speak,

67
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,030
as you're screwed,
no matter what you do,

68
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,400
you know,
and that actually frees you,

69
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:27,350
is that you,
you have power.

70
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,760
Hey,
that has catastrophes,

71
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:33,761
and you have path b that has 
catastrophes and you don't get to have 

72
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,570
the no catastrophe path,
but you get to pick which one and that's

73
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:40,571
really something because if you know 
that there's terrible risk associated 

74
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:41,900
with everything that you do and don't 
do,

75
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:44,030
then you can afford to take some risks 
because you're not,

76
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,880
you know,
this is all within the arc metaphor.

77
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,450
I'm still making the case that despite 
the fact that your life is essentially 

78
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,540
catastrophic,
you can,

79
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,600
you can make a covenant with the highest
ideal and that will take you through it 

80
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:58,620
the best way possible.
I'm,

81
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,230
I'm still making that case.

82
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,380
So.

83
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,010
So then you think,
okay,

84
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:10,011
well I'm trying to make this decision,
I'm going to go try to do something 

85
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:10,011
difficult and isn't that terrifying?
And then you think,

86
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:10,740
yeah,
but wait a minute,

87
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,560
what's really terrifying is not doing 
it.

88
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,400
And then you think about the cost of not
doing it.

89
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:20,730
So in the future authoring program,
we have people do this little meditative

90
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:21,870
exercise,
which is okay,

91
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:25,800
just think about your insufficiencies by
your own definition,

92
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:30,801
right?
The way that you don't do what you know 

93
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:32,040
you should do about the things that you 
do that you shouldn't do,

94
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,920
that you know you shouldn't do beyond a 
shadow of a doubt,

95
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:39,921
right?
There's some things like that and that 

96
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:42,071
that's bad habits and poor aim and all 
of the resentment and hatred and 

97
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:46,371
aggression and unresolved conflicts and 
all those things that are demanding you 

98
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:47,160
in warping.
You then think,

99
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,290
okay,
those things get the upper hand man,

100
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:54,291
they get the upper hand and they take 
you the worst possible place you could 

101
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:54,300
go in the next three to five years.

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,360
What exactly does that look like?
And so you sketch all that out and you 

103
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,360
think,
hey,

104
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,861
I don't want to go there.
And so the next time that attempt 

105
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:03,861
Taishan comes up,
you think,

106
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:08,061
well,
it'd be a lot better for me if I didn't 

107
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:08,061
succumb to this temptation.
It's like,

108
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:09,180
that's Kinda weak.
You'd look a little better if you didn't

109
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:11,430
eat like a cheese cake a day or 
something like that.

110
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,410
You know,
that's something,

111
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:15,450
but it's not the same as,
um,

112
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,280
I'm going to have diabetes and I'm going
to lose my damn leg and in five years if

113
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:25,281
I don't get my eating under control,
that's motivating and so then the 

114
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:26,250
temptation comes along and you think,
oh,

115
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,130
how about no,
seriously,

116
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,340
how about no,
not just because a higher good would be 

117
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,211
obtained if I avoided it,
but because of a terrible catastrophe 

118
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:40,740
would be averted if I didn't,
and so well.

119
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,320
So you want to get your fear behind you,
right?

120
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,620
You want to get it behind you where it's
pushing you forward instead of in front 

121
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,440
of you where it's stopping you and you 
get your fear behind you,

122
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:54,441
pushing you forward by actually thinking
through the consequences of not putting 

123
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:58,310
your life together and the the least of 
those is that you and suffer right?

124
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:00,020
Because you're going to suffer anyways,
man,

125
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,290
so you wasted and suffer.
That's a bad deal because maybe if 

126
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,971
you're going to suffer,
you could at least do something noble 

127
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:12,161
and Glorious and upright and powerful 
and honorable and admirable and helpful 

128
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,570
and difficult.
You know?

129
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,020
It's just so much better and maybe 
that's good enough so that you think,

130
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:18,800
hey,
you know,

131
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,350
little suffering,
it's basically worth it.

132
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,810
At least it's a way forward,
you know?

133
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,820
At least it's a way forward.
