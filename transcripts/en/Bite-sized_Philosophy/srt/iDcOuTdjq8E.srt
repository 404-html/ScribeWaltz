1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:06,090
Okay,
one of the things that I've figured out 

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:06,090
over the last years is this is a good 
proposition,

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,770
so you know,
it's pretty self evident that life is 

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,460
has got its rat's nest of miseries and 
that's for sure,

5
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:16,461
and maybe you could even make a 
categorical statement that life is 

6
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:16,461
mostly a rat's nest of misery.
You know,

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,510
when you could make a pretty powerful 
argument for that,

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,360
but then there's a counter question 
which is,

9
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:26,361
well,
what if you tried not to make it any 

10
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:26,361
more miserable than it had to be?
Right?

11
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:27,840
Then what?
Then what would it be like?

12
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,140
And my suspicions are,
is that lot of misery.

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,230
I would suspect that most of that misery
would go away because it's the 

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:36,810
unnecessary misery that really brings 
you down.

15
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:37,440
You know?
It's like,

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,060
well,
if someone has cancer,

17
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,060
it's like that sucks,
but it's not like.

18
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,110
It's not like you can say,
if only we had done this differently 

19
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,580
than that wouldn't have happened,
but when someone's out like torturing 

20
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,610
you in a malevolent way or maybe you're 
doing the same,

21
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:55,450
you can always ask yourself,
was really,

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,760
is this really necessary?

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,420
Is this just like an useless add onto 
the miseries of life?

24
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:03,570
That's what disheartens people,
and so even in your own life,

25
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:04,830
if,
if you,

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,580
if,
if you aren't suffering from self 

27
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,940
imposed misery and you're only suffering
from an escapable misery,

28
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,370
maybe you could handle that and you know
who you could,

29
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,740
you could survive,
you could bear it,

30
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,520
and even maybe without becoming 
irredeemably corrupt,

31
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,900
so the goal would be,
well,

32
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:26,901
yeah,
life is a rat's nest of miseries and 

33
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:29,300
maybe it has no ultimate meaning.
We could say that if we're feeling 

34
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,870
particularly pessimistic,
but it still leaves one question open,

35
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:33,660
which is if you didn't do everything you
could to make it worse,

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,070
how good could you make it be?
And the least answer is,

37
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:39,780
well,
it could be tragedy,

38
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:43,200
but maybe not hell.
And I think that's right.

39
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:46,590
I really believe that that's the most 
pessimistic proper statement.

40
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,830
The worst case outcome in the worst of 
all possible worlds is that your life 

41
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,870
could be tragic but not hell.
And that's a lot better than hell.

42
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,900
Right?
And you think I could give you an 

43
00:01:59,900 --> 00:01:59,900
example of the difference.
You're at your mother's death bed.

44
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,410
Well,
that's tragedy.

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,860
Here's another scenario.
You're out of your mother's death bed 

46
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,861
and all you,
you and all your idiot siblings are 

47
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:12,201
arguing.
Well that's the difference between 

48
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:15,021
tragedy and hell and you might be able 
to tolerate the first circumstance and 

49
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:16,440
maybe it would even bring you closer 
together with your family members.

50
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,260
The second one,
no one can bear that.

51
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,420
You walk away from a situation like 
that.

52
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,750
Sick of yourself and sick of everything 
else too and you know,

53
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:29,751
it's often the case that tragic 
circumstances bring out the dragons 

54
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:33,090
because the stress is high and all those
things that people haven't dealt with,

55
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,410
they don't have the energy to repress 
and,

56
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:38,640
and all the bitterness comes pouring 
forward.

57
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,690
So like seriously man it is.
So that's actually a good.

58
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,020
It's a rough lesson but it's a good 
hallmark for figuring out whether or not

59
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:51,021
you're.
You've got yourself adjusted properly 

60
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:54,230
and in relationship to your siblings.
It's like if you were all gathered 

61
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,350
around the bed,
if someone close who was dying,

62
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,920
could you manage it?
If the answer is no,

63
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,740
it's like,
well,

64
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:04,741
put your life together because it's 
going to happen and you should be the 

65
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:06,010
person who's there that can do it and do
it properly,

66
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,310
and then maybe you'd find that it isn't 
the sort of thing that will undermine 

67
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,670
your faith in life itself.
And I've seen,

68
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,830
I've seen both of those situations,
you know,

69
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,910
ugly,
ugly,

70
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:19,660
ugly situations,
murderously,

71
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:24,661
ugly situations,
and then they're opposite where people 

72
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:26,230
have had terrible things happen and to 
happen to them as a family and you know,

73
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:31,150
they pulled together and they rebuild 
their damn ship and they sail away.

74
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,790
And so that seems to me to be a lot 
better.

75
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,790
That makes,
you know,

76
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:37,930
uh,
when the flood comes,

77
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:39,130
right?
Well,

78
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,330
okay,
so the same thing.

79
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,890
The question emerges,
well,

80
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:42,730
who are you?
Well,

81
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:47,731
you could say you're this plan.
That's what people usually,

82
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,030
that's how people usually identified.
Maybe they have no plan at all and 

83
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,030
they're just in chaos,
right?

84
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,510
That's like being in the belly of the 
beast.

85
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,730
They're nihilistic and chaos.
They have no plan.

86
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,790
They're just chaos itself.
And that's a very dreadful situation for

87
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:05,791
people to be in,
or maybe they conjured together a plan 

88
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:06,700
that's their identity.
It's kind of fragile and they're holding

89
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,530
onto that with with everything they've 
got.

90
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:13,531
It's their little stick award that 
they're floating in the ocean clinging 

91
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:13,531
to,
you know?

92
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:14,890
And so they're identifying really hard 
with that plan.

93
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,350
That's what happens when you're an idiot
log has that.

94
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:19,570
You're identifying really hard with that
plan.

95
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,510
The problem is if something comes up to 
confront it,

96
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,890
well,
how do you act?

97
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,520
What you can't let go with the plan 
because you drown.

98
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,480
When you cling to it rigidly.
Well that's no good because then you 

99
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,620
can't learn anything.
Then if that's you,

100
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:34,630
you're a totalitarian,
you're going to learn anything.

101
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,870
You're going to end up in something 
that's close enough to hell so that you 

102
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,300
won't know the difference and you might 
drag everyone along with you.

103
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,070
Now it's happened plenty of times,
right?

104
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,870
It's the whole story of the 20th 
century.

105
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:47,530
It happened over and over and over,
and it happens in people's states.

106
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,730
It happens in their business 
organizations.

107
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:53,170
It happens in their cities.
It happens in their provinces,

108
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,620
it happens in their states,
and it happens in their psyches all at 

109
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,341
the same time.
You can't blame the manifestation of 

110
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:03,130
that sort of thing on any of those 
levels.

111
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:06,070
It happens when a society goes down that
way.

112
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,080
It goes down everywhere at the same 
time.

113
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:13,081
It's not the totalitarians at the top 
and all the happy people striving to be 

114
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:14,140
free at the bottom.
It's not that at all.

115
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:16,900
It's totalitarianism at every single 
level of the hierarchy,

116
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,230
including the psychological and so you 
don't want to be the thing.

117
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,000
You don't want to be in chaos,
that's for sure,

118
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:27,001
but you don't want to be the thing that 
clings so desperately to the raft that 

119
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,780
you can't let go.
When someone comes to rescue you,

120
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,460
right?
You don't want to be that,

121
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,230
so then you think,
well,

122
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,840
exactly what are you?
You're not the chaos.

123
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:35,890
You're not the plan.

124
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,700
Maybe you're the thing that confronts 
the obstacle,

125
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,660
and I would say that's the categorical 
lesson of of psychology in so far as it 

126
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:51,631
has to do with personal transformation 
because that's what you always teach 

127
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:54,871
people in psychotherapy.
I don't care what sort of 

128
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,580
psychotherapist you are,
you're always teaching them the same 

129
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:56,580
thing.
You're the thing that can.

130
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,920
You're not.
You're the planned.

131
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,950
You're the thing that can confront the 
obstacle to the plant and then when you 

132
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,190
know even further that the obstacle is 
not only an obstacle,

133
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:09,191
but opportunity itself will then your 
whole view of the world can change 

134
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:09,260
because you might think,
well,

135
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:12,020
I've got this planned.
Something came up to object to it.

136
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:17,021
It's like it's possible that the thing 
that's objecting has something to teach 

137
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:18,350
you that will take you to the place 
where you develop it.

138
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:21,380
Even better plant and it's a nice 
framework to use.

139
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,690
It's like,
are you so sure that this is a problem?

140
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,180
Is that the only way that you can look 
at it?

141
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,520
Or is it an opportunity?
I mean,

142
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,580
I'm not trying to be,
you know,

143
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,890
naive,
optimistic.

144
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,250
There are some things that's pretty hard
to extract gold from some dragons and 

145
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,220
maybe the death of a family member is a 
good example of that.

146
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,550
But even in a situation like that,
I can tell you that it's an opportunity 

147
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,120
for.
It's an opportunity for maturation,

148
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,120
that's for sure.
And the thing is you might say,

149
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:52,121
well,
it's pretty miserable to go to be 

150
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:52,121
digging for gold when someone's falling 
into the grave.

151
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,480
Well,
if they really love you,

152
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,370
first of all,
that's what they'll want you to do,

153
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,700
and second,
you're going to make their death a lot 

154
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,070
more palatable experience for them.
If you're someone who can be in the room

155
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:02,690
and be helpful instead of being,
you know,

156
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:07,691
quivering in the corner and feeling that
the entire world is collapsing in on 

157
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:07,691
you.

158
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:07,691
I mean,
that's another.

159
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:09,980
You want to be the useful person at the 
funeral.

160
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,950
How's that for a goal?
That's a good goal,

161
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:17,951
man.
You know that you've got yourself 

162
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:20,051
together in a situation like that 
because you're going to be after and 

163
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:21,890
maybe you want to be the person on whose
shoulder people cry.

164
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,500
That'd be a good goal and it's Kinda,
you know,

165
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,740
I don't like being naively optimistic.
So when I tell you to get your life 

166
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,710
together,
I'm not going to say roses and sunshine.

167
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,120
It's like,
that's,

168
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,990
that's,
that's,

169
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,050
that's Pablum for fools.
But it really is something to be the 

170
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,150
reliable person at a funeral.
Right?

171
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,300
And you can aim it that you can do that.
You gotta be tough to do that because it

172
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:49,301
also means that you can sustain a major 
loss without collapsing and that you've 

173
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:52,160
got to be a monster to do that.
Right?
