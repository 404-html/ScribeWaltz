1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,420
I guess passive resistance or nonviolent
resistance?

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:09,860
No,
no,

3
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:13,460
not nonresistance.
It's actually.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,870
It's one step further than nonviolence.
It's like you don't even resist.

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,240
That's what.
That's what tolstoy was talking about.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,930
It's from the sermon of the Mount where 
Christ said,

7
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:26,690
resist not evil.
That was like,

8
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:31,691
you don't even resist it.
And so I thought that there was a 

9
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:31,691
metaphysics to that potential.
Yeah.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,730
Well then I would say that you,
you,

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,620
you've asked me a question that I can't 
answer.

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,030
I mean,
I guess that would be in the same line 

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,030
as turned the other cheek.
Now that's,

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,070
that's in a way it's.
Yeah,

15
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,700
yeah.
There's some nuance there.

16
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:55,701
I thought there is.
There is because turn the other cheek 

17
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:58,701
means don't participate in an escalating
cycle of violence and that's reasonable 

18
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:03,060
man.
That if you can do that,

19
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,770
resist not evil.
You know when I go into the sermon on 

20
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,241
the mount,
I go into all the individual lines and 

21
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,710
look up multiple translations and 
multiple interpretations and try to.

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,230
Because sometimes though it's extremely 
interesting,

23
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:24,231
like for example,
when there's a line in the new 

24
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:27,780
testament,
that's the meek shall inherit the earth.

25
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,000
That's not the right translation.
Oh really?

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,160
That is not what that means.
That means,

27
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,190
and it's Germane to our discussion.
That means those who have those who are 

28
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,900
competent to use force but do not wield 
it,

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,980
will inherit the earth.
That is a whole different issue.

30
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,460
I would like to see exactly what resists
not means because my suspicions are that

31
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:59,871
the devil's in the details,
but it's definitely a sufficiently 

32
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,970
jarring an injunction to be worthy of 
further investigation bit especially 

33
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:11,981
because I've heard you talk in the past 
about how how futile it is to show up 

34
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:15,110
somewhere with a placard.
That's probably a very expressed version

35
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:19,100
of of how resisting what you deem to be 
evil.

36
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,910
Just the act of resisting it alone is so
useless.

37
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,060
It's a waste of energy.
Right.

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,990
Like actual energy.
Very interesting.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,860
That's a very interesting take on that.
So that's why I think it's interesting.

40
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:36,861
You know,
because I've been thinking about 

41
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:39,780
continuing my whatever you might 
describe it as struggle,

42
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:43,680
let's say with the the forces that are 
corrupting the university.

43
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,550
I thought for a long time in terms of 
war metaphors with regards to that and 

44
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:55,611
then over the summer when I got a bit of
a break and was able to think more 

45
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:58,230
clearly or begin to think more clearly 
about whatever it is I might be doing,

46
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,230
I realized that my primary role on 
youtube and perhaps publicly is not

47
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,910
the leader of a war against the social 
justice warriors.

48
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,940
It's more like think of encouragement 
and education with that as a side 

49
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:16,480
effect,
let's say,

50
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,870
and maybe even a concern,
but if it's a war,

51
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:22,040
then it's the wrong approach.
You're,

52
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,300
you're stuck is maybe you also dignify 
your enemy with a war.

53
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,000
You actually encode their power,
right?

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,260
Resistance as a waste of time.
That's really useful.

55
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,670
A waste of energy.
It you bet.

56
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,810
You Bet.
Well,

57
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:41,680
it has all those aspects we discussed.
It has the glorification of the enemy as

58
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:46,681
well because it might be far more 
effective to say that whole thing is,

59
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:52,010
dad,
here's a different way.
