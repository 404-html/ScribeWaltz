1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,360
Okay,
so now I have played with kids that 

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,341
haven't had any rough and tumble play 
and it's really hard to play with them 

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,020
partly because they're there,
they're easily frightened,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,520
you know,
they'd like to play.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,160
I know how to play with kids.
They'd like to play.

6
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:15,720
They're pretty hepped up on it,
you know,

7
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:17,160
and they,
they really excited,

8
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:20,640
especially about physical plane,
but they're awkward,

9
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:21,690
you know,
so you play with them,

10
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:24,180
they stick their thumb in your eye or 
you know,

11
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:29,181
or they cry really easily with nothing 
really happens and like they just don't 

12
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:33,891
have it together.
A kid that has done a lot of physical 

13
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:34,830
interaction,
physical plane,

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,890
that kid,
it's a different sort of kid because the

15
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:40,200
first thing the kid knows,
it's not a rule.

16
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,470
The first thing the kid knows is how 
forceful can he be with you so that it's

17
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:51,000
exciting and interesting and fun,
but it's not too much.

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,530
And that's really an interesting 
question because actually to really play

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,930
a good game like a physical contact 
game,

20
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:02,931
like wrestling with a kid is that you 
want to let that kid come right up to 

21
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:06,060
the edge of hurting you.
And the closer the kid gets to the edge,

22
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:11,061
the more fun it is for both because the 
kid will give you a whack and who you 

23
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:12,240
know and that's,
it's good,

24
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:17,241
you know,
and then maybe he'll give you a harder 

25
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:17,241
whack to see if he can get away with it.
The kids will often,

26
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:21,050
they'll come up to you,
whack you and then run away and then 

27
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,871
they'll look and if you're laughing then
they'll come back and try a harder one 

28
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:26,841
and then you know,
they're doing it incrementally because 

29
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:28,380
it's exploratory behavior.
And part of the exploration is okay,

30
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,700
what our bodies like.
And the answered that is,

31
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,120
well,
what can you get away with doing to 

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,120
them?

33
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,210
But it's a more sophisticated answer to 
which is what can you get away with 

34
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,041
doing to them in a way that allows you 
to continue to explore without fear or 

35
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:51,561
punishment.
And without blowing the whole game to 

36
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:51,561
bits,
okay,

37
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:54,771
so how do you figure that out?
You do not talk about it because you 

38
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:55,560
can't,
you have to act it out.

39
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,860
It's like so.
So the kids hitting you in wrestling and

40
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,920
pulling your hair and doing all these 
things and you're modifying its behavior

41
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,170
very,
very carefully and,

42
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,730
and,
and minuscule detail.

43
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,970
And then you get a kid who can wrestle 
like mad and they're fun to play with.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,250
They bounce around like a dog that will 
bite you.

45
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:16,251
You know,
a good well trained dog you can really 

46
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:16,251
play with and you can play with them 
rough.

47
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:18,120
And it's a blast.
The dog has a good time.

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,460
That person has a good time.
It's like excellent.

49
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:25,461
That's a socialized dawn.
So the other thing that kids learn 

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,210
learns,
which is quite cool,

51
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:32,211
is what hurts them and what doesn't and 
how afraid can they be and still have 

52
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:34,860
fun.
So you know,

53
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,930
when you're wrestling with a kid,
you've put them,

54
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,250
you know,
you put them face down,

55
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,980
you put your elbow on them,
you bend them around,

56
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:42,870
you throw them in the air and catch 
them.

57
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,140
You know,
you've grabbed him by the leg and maybe 

58
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,761
you pull them over and you know,
and what you're showing the kid is 

59
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:51,870
here's a bunch of things that your body 
can do and it's okay that they're,

60
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,460
they're being done that isn't going to 
hurt you and you're not talking about,

61
00:02:56,461 --> 00:03:01,461
you're showing them and so the kid gets 
kind of about what he or she can 

62
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:07,681
withstand physically and the difference 
between pain and not paying and the 

63
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:13,021
difference between fear and not fear and
when something is threatening and when 

64
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:13,030
it's not.

65
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,140
It's very sophisticated.
It's very sophisticated behavior and 

66
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,020
that's partly why kids love to play.
Now.

67
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:22,070
One of the things that's happened,
which is you know,

68
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,120
an indication of a deep sickness in our 
society is that I used to work in a 

69
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,621
daycare center right when I was about 
your age because I really like kids and 

70
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:33,520
they like to play with me because I know
how to play with them.

71
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:38,521
And so one of the things I would do with
the little kids was I would draw them 

72
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:39,010
horrible monsters,
right?

73
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,920
Like big teeth things on.
I just sketched them out.

74
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,270
They weren't any works of art,
you know,

75
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:45,940
but those damn kids,
they would line up to get a picture of a

76
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:47,890
monster,
draw me a picture of the monster,

77
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:52,891
drop me a picture of a monster.
It's like they love those little 

78
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:52,900
pictures of monsters so that I was 
pretty funny.

79
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,060
And other thing I would do is play with 
them.

80
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,260
I'd take them out in the yard and grab 
an arm and a leg and spin them around 

81
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,000
and bend them over and,
you know,

82
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,890
twist them around and let them crawl on 
me.

83
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:06,630
And um,
there's always one kid in the group that

84
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:07,870
couldn't do that though.
He's like,

85
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,480
he hadn't been paid attention to enough,
you know.

86
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:15,481
So he was,
I think it was like a Taoist uncarved 

87
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:18,240
block,
very vague and ill defined and clunky 

88
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,540
and so kid like that,
you know,

89
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,660
you'd sit down,
it's so sad you sit down and you're 

90
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,810
interacting with the kids and that kid 
comes along sort of lumping along,

91
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:29,380
you know,
like this and they plop plop on your lap

92
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:32,200
and they like,
they're about as sophisticated as like a

93
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:33,370
six month old,
you know?

94
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,410
And they're quite annoying,
you know,

95
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,470
which is a horrible thing because 
they're so desperate for attention and 

96
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,110
it's too late often by the time 
therefore it's like,

97
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,910
good luck fixing that man.

98
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,590
It's not going to happen,
you know,

99
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:48,790
and those kids are just screwed because 
what happens to them is they're so lumpy

100
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:53,791
and ill formed and,
and uncomfortable in their body and 

101
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,941
socially clueless and inattentive and 
blind and ignored and resentful that no 

102
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:02,611
other kids will play with them.
And it's no wonder because there are 

103
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:03,610
other kids are way the hell up on the 
play development trend.

104
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,420
And so their board staff by them,
it's like playing with a nine month old,

105
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,830
which,
which kids will do,

106
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,440
you know,
but that's not pure play.

107
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,120
And so those kids just drift off.
They get,

108
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,550
they stay on the outside of the peer 
group and they never get into it.

109
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,270
They never get into it.
So very,

110
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:27,271
very ugly.
And so now in daycare centers you can't 

111
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:29,200
touch the kids.
It's like what the hell,

112
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,370
you know?
Well why?

113
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Well,
because he can't distinguish play for 

114
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,400
molesting.
It's like who can't distinguish that,

115
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,580
you know?
And what are you going to do?

116
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,350
You're not gonna.
You're gonna deprive.

117
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:41,560
The kids have play because of your 
stupid paranoia.

118
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,080
That's the whole.
That's the whole process,

119
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:45,190
right?
Brilliant.

120
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,730
Brilliant.
You know what you're doing is you're 

121
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,361
teaching children that adults are so 
dangerous that they can't be trusted to 

122
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:55,270
be near you.
That's a lovely thing to teach children,

123
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,130
especially because they're going to be 
adults.
