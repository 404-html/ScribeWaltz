1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And the thing about a comprehensive 
narrative is it can't leave out and 

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,250
archetipal character or it fails.
I can give you an example of this.

3
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:13,251
Okay.
So how many of you have seen Disney 

4
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:14,700
sleeping beauty?
Okay.

5
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:15,930
So,
so many of you have.

6
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:18,130
How many Harvard?
Okay.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,710
So,
so there's a few that happened while the

8
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:20,700
Disney movies,
you know,

9
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:24,990
they're kind of standard childhood fairy
in sleeping beauty.

10
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:29,991
What happens is that the king and queen 
give birth to a princess after trying 

11
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:31,780
for a substantial amount of time and you
know,

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,890
she arrives healthy and beautiful and 
then they have a christening day and 

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,600
they invite everybody to it,
but they don't invite maleficent who's a

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,150
dark,
which roughly speaking,

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:42,990
you know,
like she's,

16
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:45,080
uh,
she's queen of the underworld that for,

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,570
for lack of a better word,
she's the negative element of femininity

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,180
and they don't invite her to the party.

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,690
And so she shows up anyways and says 
that because they didn't invite her,

20
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,930
their daughters going to die when,
when she had 16,

21
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,390
which is roughly the age of,
let's say,

22
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:06,000
sexual maturation for a story of that 
sort.

23
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,930
Now there's another little positive 
magic female in the story who mitigates 

24
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:19,341
that death sentence to protracted sleep.
While the idea behind it,

25
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:24,030
it's a very,
very interesting story.

26
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:29,031
It's an incredible story in a sense 
because what it says is that if your 

27
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:33,150
parents protect you too much from the 
dark side of life when you're young,

28
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,710
that what will happen when you start to 
on the road to maturity is you'll be so 

29
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:43,971
naive and so fragile that you'll want to
be unconscious instead of paying 

30
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:49,131
attention and that you're going to have 
to be rescued from that state by 

31
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:53,361
something and it could be a prince,
which is one which is how that story 

32
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:53,361
plays itself out.

33
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:58,250
Or it also could be the symbolically 
masculine and exploratory element of 

34
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:03,561
your own psyche,
and the stories are ambivalent about 

35
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:06,890
whether it's an external event or an 
intern with and it doesn't really 

36
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:06,890
matter.
You know,

37
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:06,890
the,
the,

38
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,480
the things ended up being the same.
And so that's actually what happens in 

39
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,220
this sleeping beauty story.
You know,

40
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:17,221
at the end,
a prince who's also enslaved by this 

41
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:22,010
terrible negative feminine force,
manages to escape and the maleficent 

42
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,190
turns into a dragon and he has to fight 
her and then he goes and rescues the 

43
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,881
princess and she wakes up and the 
kingdoms rejuvenated and everybody's 

44
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:32,760
happy.
It's a classic classic story,

45
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,110
you know,
and it's not.

46
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,850
It's funny because the Disney movie 
frozen was put forward as a,

47
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,250
in some sense as a feminist alternative 
to the classic fairytales.

48
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,760
And first of all,
you can't do that.

49
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:46,830
You can't just generate a fairytale.

50
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,420
You know,
there's recent evidence that some of 

51
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:52,420
these fairytales,
the ones that the grimm brothers and the

52
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,350
and Hans Christian Andersen collective 
are up to 10,000

53
00:02:55,351 --> 00:03:00,351
years old.
You can't just come up with a counter 

54
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:00,351
fairytale.
That's,

55
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:04,460
that's just not how it works.
And the way that fairy tale is 

56
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,250
structured,
it has nothing to do with,

57
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,920
with the necessity for anyone to rely on
anyone else for anything.

58
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,980
It's a complex portrayal of the denied 
dynamic relationship between archetypal 

59
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,030
characters.
And you know,

60
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:24,031
it's one form of the story.
There's lots of different forms of the 

61
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:27,331
story,
but what I liked about sleeping beauty 

62
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:27,331
for example,
and Mrs,

63
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:30,610
what's Nice about the real fairy tales 
is that along with the positive there is

64
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:35,611
negative and it's real negative.
Like real fairy tales are terrified and 

65
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:36,280
like I don't.
Who is it?

66
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,780
Is it sleeping beauty or in Snow White,
I don't remember.

67
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,780
In one of the famous grimm fairy tales,
one of the evil sisters ends up dancing 

68
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,920
and red hot shoes until she dies.
You know,

69
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,360
it's,
they're very,

70
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:53,800
very violent and and unsettling,
and it's because they,

71
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:58,801
you know,
they have the quality of genuine folk 

72
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:00,751
tales,
but the reason for that is because 

73
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:02,251
they're dealing with real things like 
the Hansel and Gretel story is a good 

74
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:02,251
example of that,
right?

75
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:07,020
Kids are abandoned out in the woods.
They find something that's too good to 

76
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,381
be true inside this thing that's too 
good to be true is something that wants 

77
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:12,340
to fatten them up and devour them.
It's a rough story,

78
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:18,210
but what it's doing at the stories,
the stories have evolved to represent 

79
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:20,830
the fundamental dynamic elements of 
existence.

80
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,090
If you conceptualize existence in,
in,

81
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,330
in terms of character,
and the thing is you have to 

82
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,000
conceptualize existence in terms of 
character if you're a person because 

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,140
what you do in existence is act out your
character,

84
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,770
so your character is an element of 
existence.

85
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,250
Now you might say,
well that doesn't mean that society has 

86
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,401
a character,
but actually it does mean that because 

87
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:48,070
partly what happens,
like if you're a socialized,

88
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,100
say into a culture,
the culture exists in the same 

89
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,930
relationship to you roughly speaking as 
another person does.

90
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,140
So for example,
if you put money in the bank,

91
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,290
which is in principle a representation 
of your labor.

92
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,310
What you're doing is entering into a 
contract with the broader social world,

93
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:11,311
which is one of promise essentially 
where the future society promises to 

94
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,270
return your value at a future date.
So it's a contractual relationship and 

95
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,180
the reason that God,
the father is a very common 

96
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,091
representation is because treating the 
they in in Heideggerian terms,

97
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,360
the others in Heideggerian terms as if 
they're an embodied entity actually 

98
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:34,810
works.
