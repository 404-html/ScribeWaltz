1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,970
Let's say that you've had repeated 
fights with your wife about how domestic

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:09,260
duties are going to be arranged among 
around mealtime and you believe me.

3
00:00:09,261 --> 00:00:12,560
You're going to have those fights and so
and so.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,680
What's happening is that mealtimes are 
unpleasant because there's a war for 

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,370
power going on in the kitchen.
Right?

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,730
And so then you think one day while 
you're gonna,

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,230
you're gonna.
Note that and you're going to do an 

8
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:31,390
archaeological investigation and find 
out just what the hell is going on.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,560
And so you start unpacking the fact that
mealtimes are not pleasant.

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,390
And so what's in that little thing that 
you're unpacking that package?

11
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:42,660
Well,

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,100
the entire power dynamic between men and
women in the modern world is inside that

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,520
dispute.
And you might find that part of the 

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,900
reason that your wife is upset about the
way that mealtimes are arranged.

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,100
Because because her grand mother was 
beat by her grandfather and that's 

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:06,330
playing a role in.
It played a role in determining her 

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,891
unconscious expectations.
And that's pathologizing one of the day 

18
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:13,180
to day rituals in the house.
And if you're going to unpack that,

19
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:15,830
you're going to have to unpack all of 
that into the.

20
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,890
You take a little monster and you 
decompose it and you find out it's a 

21
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,451
hydrates.
Got 50 heads and then you have to work 

22
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:24,610
through every single one of those.
It's really,

23
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:28,300
really difficult and so it's a container
that contains everything.

24
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,400
But the thing is if you unpack it 
successfully,

25
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,200
let's say,
and you deal with it,

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,650
you negotiate a consensus,
then all of a sudden you get,

27
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,480
you get paced,
say around your meal times,

28
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:42,481
which is a major accomplishment man,
because you have to eat three times a 

29
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:43,630
day and it's the center of the household
and all of that.

30
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,630
So,
but the thing is is that often when 

31
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,550
you're especially in the context of a of
an intimate relationship,

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,320
things will emerge that produced 
discontinuity.

33
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,700
And the question is,
what should your attitude towards that 

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,801
discontinuity be?
While you can punish the person for 

35
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:03,160
manifesting that discontinuity,
that's the tyrannical aspect,

36
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:06,580
or you can let it take the whole thing 
apart and that will happen.

37
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:11,581
I mean,
that's often how relationships and is 

38
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:13,681
that a discontinuity emerges and people 
get into it and things go sideways so 

39
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:19,711
badly that the whole relationship 
descends into chaos and people bail out 

40
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:20,410
of it.
So.

41
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,710
So it's no wonder that people want to 
ignore it and it's also no wonder that 

42
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,800
they want to tyrannized it.
It's like,

43
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,110
quit bothering me with that.
Well,

44
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,300
possibly,
but probably not.

45
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:38,170
And also if my attitude towards you is 
quit bothering me with that,

46
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,010
your attitude towards me when I have the
same sort of problem in reverse,

47
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:47,011
it's going to be exactly the same.
And so we're not going to get anywhere 

48
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:47,011
with it.
