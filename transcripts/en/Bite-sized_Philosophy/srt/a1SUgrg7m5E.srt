1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,420
He wrote these books,
notebooks that haven't been published 

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,831
yet,
called the black books and the black 

3
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:12,291
books are the documentation of his 
experiments with his imagination and 

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,110
what he would do is daydream like,
like a child daydreams.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,910
He regained that faculty,
although I think with you,

6
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:24,810
and it was a faculty that has never 
really disappeared and he had figures of

7
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:29,811
imagination that came to him that he 
could speak with and he spoke with these

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:34,470
figures of imagination and documented 
that over a very long period of time.

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,950
And that was originally.
That was eventually distilled into a 

10
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:46,521
book called the Red Book,
which was published about three or four 

11
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,090
years ago.
And it was a book that young regarded as

12
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:53,091
the central source from which all his 
inspiration emerged.

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,350
It was sort of the way it looks to me is
that we embody a lot of information in 

14
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:02,520
our action.

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,020
Right?
And our action has developed as a 

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,691
consequence of imitating other people 
and not only the people or the people 

17
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:16,281
around us,
but of course the people around us 

18
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:16,281
imitated the people who came before them
and those people in imitated.

19
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:20,811
The people who came before them and so 
on so far back that it's as far back as 

20
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:25,761
you can go,
and so you embody these patterns of 

21
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:27,420
behavior that are extremely informative,
that you don't understand,

22
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,630
that are a consequence of collective 
invitation across the centuries and 

23
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,661
throw.
Then those patterns can become manifest 

24
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:39,111
as figures of the imagination and those 
failures of imagination are the 

25
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:44,151
distillations of patterns of behavior 
and so as the distillations of patterns 

26
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:50,961
of behavior,
they have content and it's not you that 

27
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:53,961
content.
It's you could even think about it as 

28
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:54,270
content that's evolved.
Although it's culturally transmitted.

29
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:59,271
It's content that's evolved and so these
figures of the imagination can reveal 

30
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:04,070
the structure of reality to you and 
that's what happened with young and 

31
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,541
that's what he described in the red book
and that was what permeated his 

32
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:08,541
psychology.

33
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:14,070
Psychology.
That was based on the presupposition 

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,140
that the fundamental architectural 
structures of religious belief.

35
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,070
We're not pathological,
not deceitful,

36
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,570
not protective in some delusional sense 
against the fear of death,

37
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,810
but quite the contrary.
The very stories that enabled us to move

38
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:35,271
forward as confident human beings in the
face of chaos itself and it's 

39
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:42,141
conceivable,
I think perhaps probable that nothing 

40
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:47,421
more important conceptually happened in 
the 20th century than that because it 

41
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:54,351
was the first time post enlightenment 
that Ab rapprochement between the 

42
00:02:55,681 --> 00:03:00,681
intellect and the underlying religious 
archetipal occurred.

43
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,690
You have in the capacious intellect of 
young and the same thing happened to 

44
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,531
some degree with piaget.
The religious domain and the factual 

45
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:14,851
domain were brought back together and 
the fact of young's enduring and 

46
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,180
increasing popularity and influence,
I would say is a direct consequence of 

47
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,081
that.
Now some of his work was spun off into 

48
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:31,501
the new age and the new age is a very 
optimistic and naive movement.

49
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,930
It's predicated on the idea that you can
do nothing say,

50
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:39,931
but follow your bliss and that will take
you ever hire to enlightenment.

51
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:45,031
And that's not the union idea at all.
The union idea is that what you most 

52
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:50,170
need will be found where you least want 
to look.

53
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,960
So there's this story.
King Arthur,

54
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:55,780
there's this story of King Arthur the.
They're all in round table,

55
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,430
right?
King Arthur and his knights,

56
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:59,750
they're all equals.
They're all super ordinary,

57
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,970
but they're all equals and they go off 
to look for the holy grail from the holy

58
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:07,030
grail.
Grail is the container of the redemptive

59
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:12,031
substance,
whatever that is might be the cup the 

60
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,110
Christ used at the last supper might be 
a cellist that was used to capture his 

61
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,990
blood on the cross,
right when he was pierced by a sword.

62
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:25,140
The stories differ,
but that's the holy grail and the holy 

63
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,140
grail is lost.

64
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,680
That's the redemptive substance and the 
knights of King Arthur go off to search 

65
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,520
for the holy grail and but they don't 
know where to look.

66
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,030
So where do you look when you don't know
where to look for something you need 

67
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,530
desperately,
but I've lost.

68
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,370
Well,
each of the nights goes into the forest 

69
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,231
at the point that looks darkest to him,
and that's union psychoanalysis in a 

70
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:51,541
nutshell.
It's like that which you fear and avoid 

71
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,261
that which you hold in contempt,
that which disgusts you and that you 

72
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:59,491
avoid.
That's the gateway to what you need to 

73
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:00,610
know.
There's nothing new agey about that,

74
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,960
that's for sure.
