1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,880
Where you have to remember when you 
watch something like this movie,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,910
not a single bit of it is random or 
occidental,

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,880
none of it because you know they had to 
draw,

4
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:12,000
I don't remember how many frames per 
second these things are 30,

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:13,710
maybe.
Maybe it's a little less than that,

6
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:18,711
but it's high quality automation and so 
someone had to paint 30 pictures to get 

7
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:21,300
a second of this.
You're not doing that accidentally.

8
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:26,301
It's really expensive and everyone has 
to agree on exactly what's going to 

9
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:26,580
happen and you might say,
well,

10
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:30,090
do the people who are doing this 
consciously know what they're doing?

11
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,880
And that answer of that is well,
sort of just like you do,

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,030
you know it's yes they know and no they 
don't and they know because they're 

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,130
really smart and gifted and all that,
but they don't know because it's not all

14
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:41,940
articulated.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,940
Plus they're working in a group so they 
know and don't know just like you do 

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,710
when you're watching it and so and and 
when you do anything else.

17
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,250
So now they're also guided by what you 
might call.

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,940
They're guided by their unconscious in 
the in the Friday and and in the 

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,631
cognitive way,
partly because your unconscious value 

20
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:06,171
structures determine the direction and 
content of your perceptions and so it's 

21
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:10,221
built right into the way you move your 
eyes because you tend to look at things 

22
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:11,880
you value right or things you're afraid 
of,

23
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:16,881
like you look at things with valence and
part of the decision about what has 

24
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:19,890
value is dependent on the implicit 
structure of your moral system,

25
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:24,891
your purse,
because morality is about what's good 

26
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:26,961
and what isn't,
and that's been partly a conscious 

27
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:27,300
construction of you,
but it's partly something you've been.

28
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:32,510
You've picked up by interacting with 
people like mad ever since you were 

29
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:32,510
born.

30
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,870
You don't know all the rules anymore 
than the damn cricket did.

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,650
You just don't and you can't because 
you're too complicated,

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,680
but you act them out and then you also 
have representations of how people act 

33
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:46,380
in your imagination.
Dreams are.

34
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,360
That's what a dream is.
That's what a fantasy is.

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,600
That's what that little movie that plays
inside your head when you remember what 

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,720
you did is,
and you only remember the just you know,

37
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,900
so even the the images stick 
representation of your behavior in your 

38
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,710
past,
which is basically your episodic memory.

39
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,020
It's already selecting and molding and 
turning it into a relatable story.

40
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,470
It can't help but do that.
It's the only way you can represent it 

41
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,500
and so you don't know how you do that or
why you do that,

42
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:18,501
but part of it's governed by this 
implicit morality that's part of your 

43
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:22,550
procedural memory system,
part of the way you act and part of the 

44
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,161
way you move your eyes and listen to 
things and focus on them and that's all 

45
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:27,240
been instantiated inside of you because 
of this immense social,

46
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,450
your biology,
but also this immense social project 

47
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,470
that you're continually engaged in and 
so that informs what you remembered.

48
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,470
It informs what you imagined.
It informs what we collectively 

49
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,071
imagined.
It informs what we can collectively 

50
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:43,470
understand and partly what you're doing 
well,

51
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:48,471
you become conscious of yourself is to 
map the implicit structures that already

52
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:54,510
constitute you from society into 
explicit representation.

53
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,750
That's what self understanding means and
you know when you have that moment of 

54
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,381
insight about you've done,
it's like you're watching your this 

55
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:07,020
repetitive behavior that you've 
manifested probably that got you in 

56
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,270
trouble.
You know it's your characteristic way of

57
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,800
falling accidentally into chaos and you 
talk about your problems.

58
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:16,801
You talk about them with your friends,
you talk about them and maybe you have 

59
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:19,741
dreams about them and you're,
you're trying to relate them and you 

60
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,171
have memories about them that you can't 
get rid of because they're negatively 

61
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:24,871
tones.
So you talk about them and then someone 

62
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,151
comes up with a little statement that 
links them together causally and you 

63
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:27,151
think,
oh,

64
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:28,180
that's what I'm doing.

65
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,700
And then maybe you can stop doing it,
or at least,

66
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,020
or at least maybe.
Then you can think of some strategies 

67
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,640
for not doing it anymore.
But it's not like,

68
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:39,190
you know,
it's like you're acting it out.

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,180
You know it that way.
But until that's all,

70
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,880
until the representation matches that 
pattern,

71
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,960
that click of insight doesn't occur.
And that's like a revelation.

72
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:54,990
It's a really good way of thinking about
it because the knowledge is there and 

73
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,590
it's implicit forum and all of a sudden 
bang.

74
00:03:56,591 --> 00:04:00,640
It's been made explicit as a fantasy 
maybe or also as a,

75
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,430
as a set of semantic statements.
You know,

76
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,640
maybe you're,
you have a crush on someone and you 

77
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,651
don't notice it.
And maybe you find yourself having a 

78
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:10,651
fantasy about them.
You Think,

79
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:14,041
oh,
that means something that indicates 

80
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:17,761
something.
Maybe you don't want him to know that 

81
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:17,761
that's what you want.

82
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:20,980
But the fantasy will tell you.
And one of the things you suggested,

83
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,820
and this is sort of out of the Freudian 
tradition of free associations,

84
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:29,821
is watch yourself.
Watch your fantasies because they're 

85
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:29,980
always happening.
And so,

86
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,330
and they'll tell you something.
And so one of the things I do when,

87
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,930
when I'm interacting with my clients is 
we'll have a discussion and then they'll

88
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:41,931
let their eyes will drift a little bit.
And I'll know that there are somethings 

89
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:42,380
flitted through their mind,
you know?

90
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,980
And that means we've touched on 
something that has multiple,

91
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,310
a multiplicity of elements,
and so I'll stop and say,

92
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:51,100
look,
I noticed that you maybe you tear it up,

93
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,570
that's another thing to really watch 
her.

94
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:57,571
Maybe you laugh or you drifted.
At least it's like it's because some 

95
00:04:57,571 --> 00:04:58,780
other thought has entered your field of 
consciousness.

96
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:02,530
And then if you can get the person to 
grab those thoughts to notice them,

97
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,010
then you can often figure out the 
avenues along which that particular 

98
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,680
conversation might unfold.

99
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,800
That's a complex,
that's a union complex or a 

100
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,950
psychoanalytic complex.
It's like there's an emotional core that

101
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:19,060
produces a whole range of associated 
ideas and that thing's got a life.

102
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:24,061
It's like a micro personality and it 
might have resentment and it might have 

103
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:27,751
anger.
It's often negative emotion tinge 

104
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:30,600
because the negative emotion tinge to 
episodes are still problems and they 

105
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:36,210
will emerge automatically because your 
threat detection systems force them onto

106
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,910
your consciousness essentially.
So you watch and where when you drift,

107
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,570
you will drift.
And the fantasy is partly a 

108
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,821
representation of the problem space.
You know that happens when you wake up 

109
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:48,700
at three in the morning and you're 
worried about things,

110
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,030
right?
Because actually what happens is you 

111
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,831
wake up during threat processing and if 
you're depressed actually that gets so 

112
00:05:55,831 --> 00:06:00,181
intense you can't sleep,
so then you just lay there all night 

113
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:00,181
worrying,
not fun,

114
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:03,170
and those are fantasies about the 
negative elements of your past,

115
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:08,171
present and future,
and the fantasies can also breed 

116
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:08,171
solutions.

117
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:11,960
And that's partly why Freud regard 
dreams as wish fulfillments.

118
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,980
It's partly that and he wasn't.
That was where he stopped.

119
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,400
It's not correct.
It's partially correct.

120
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:24,401
It's like the fantasy will provide you 
with a problem and a potential solution,

121
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,950
but they're more like problem 
identification mechanisms.

122
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,160
The fantasies with the possibility of a 
solution built in and so a way of 

123
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:39,251
thinking about that is that you can 
generate potential futures so they're 

124
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:45,200
like each segregated environments 
according to the rules of your fantasy.

125
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,380
Then you can generate little avatars of 
yourself that didn't have at each of 

126
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,351
those little universes and you can run 
them as simulations and then you can 

127
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:57,251
watch what happens in the simulation and
if it's a catastrophe then you don't 

128
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,270
have to act it out and that's exactly 
not exactly.

129
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,180
That's akin to what you're doing when 
you go watch a movie,

130
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:05,750
except that is much more coherent and 
well thought through,

131
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,940
you know,
and then than just a dream which is 

132
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:10,940
often quite fragmentary.

133
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,040
And that's partly because the dream is 
willing to sacrifice coherence to play 

134
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:17,600
with category structures,
you know,

135
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:22,601
and that's why in dreams things can 
change from one thing into another 

136
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,500
really weirdly or scenes can change from
one scene to another without a logic.

137
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,710
The logic gets loosened so that the 
experience of your thinking can widen 

138
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,190
and it's,
it's,

139
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,390
it's dangerous to do that.
And that's partly why you do it when 

140
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,390
you're asleep and paralyzed,
you know,

141
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,090
you don't run around and act out your,
your suit,

142
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:41,720
a puddle fantasies,
you know,

143
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,580
where you're stretching yourself out 
into the world.

144
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,990
There's no risk.
Exactly.

145
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,730
And so,
although it can be bad enough,

146
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:48,450
so you'll wake up in terror,
you know,

147
