1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,850
Earlier when you talked about 
criminality and creativity trends in,

2
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:05,530
uh,
in men peaking at 14,

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,740
it reminded me of something you said,
I think it was Joe Rogan.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,070
I'm talking with sjws and kind of in how
they create their own chaos,

5
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:17,200
talking about how adolescents have this 
drive to change the world.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,960
And I was wondering if,
uh,

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,890
if those three,
the criminality,

8
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:24,940
creativity drive to change the world are
linked and if so,

9
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:29,941
if they manifest differently in men and 
women and if they couldn't have come 

10
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:30,270
from the same.

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,900
I think they are linked.
But I'm going to concentrate more on the

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,160
second part of your question.
So I'm going to ask you about something.

13
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:39,900
So I talked to a friend of mine the 
other day.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,940
He's a very,
very smart guy and we've been talking 

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,481
about all the sorts of things that we've
been talking about tonight for a long 

16
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,080
time.
And we were talking about the relatively

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,510
the relative evolutionary roles of men 
and women.

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,680
This is speculative obviously.
And and because our research did 

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,140
indicate it's tended of research so far 
that,

20
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,580
that the,
the,

21
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:04,650
the SGS sjw sort of equality above all 
else philosophy is more prevalent among 

22
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:11,241
women,
what it's predicted by the personality 

23
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:12,060
factors that are more common among 
women,

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,640
so agreeableness and high negative 
emotion,

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,360
primarily agreeableness.
But in addition it's also predicted by 

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,961
being female.
And that's interesting because in most 

27
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:26,751
of the personality research that I've 
done and as far as I know in the 

28
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:26,910
literature at,
you know,

29
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,990
in more broadly speaking,
most of the time you can get rid of the 

30
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,870
attitudinal differences between men and 
women or at least reduce them by 

31
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:35,870
controlling for personality.

32
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,980
So if you take a feminine man in a 
masculine woman,

33
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,250
then you know the polls reverse.
But that didn't seem to be the case with

34
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:48,651
political correctness.
And so I've been thinking about that a 

35
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:48,651
lot because,
well,

36
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:53,421
men are bailing out of the humanities 
like mad and pretty much out of the 

37
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:56,781
universities except for step,
the women are moving in like mad and 

38
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:58,920
they're also moving into the political 
sphere like Matt and this is new,

39
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:03,921
right?
We've never had this happen before and 

40
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:03,921
we do.
No,

41
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:06,291
no.
Do not know what the significance of it 

42
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,211
is.
It's only 50 years old and so we were 

43
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,540
thinking about this and so I don't know 
what you think about this proposition,

44
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,220
but imagine that,
that,

45
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,310
that historically speaking at something 
like women were responsible for 

46
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:19,350
distribution and men were responsible 
for production,

47
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,190
something like that.
And maybe maybe that's only the case 

48
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,190
really in the tight confines of the 
immediate family,

49
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:31,191
but that doesn't matter because that's 
most of the evolutionary landscape for 

50
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:31,191
human beings anyways.

51
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:33,570
But the women does it did was make sure 
that everybody got enough.

52
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,650
Okay.
And that seems to me to be one of the 

53
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:39,650
things that's driving,
at least in part,

54
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,120
the sjw demand for,
for equity and equality.

55
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,850
It's like,
let's make sure everybody has enough.

56
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,750
It's like,
well look,

57
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:46,530
fair enough.
You know,

58
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:46,910
I mean,
you,

59
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,690
you can't,
you can't argue with that,

60
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,930
but there's,
there's an antipathy between that and 

61
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,300
the reality of differential productivity
because people really do differ in their

62
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:59,040
productivity.
So.

63
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,810
All right,
so to answer your question fully,

64
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,650
I do think that the rebellious tendency 
of adolescents is associated both with 

65
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,091
that criminality spike,
especially among men and with 

66
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:12,091
creativity.
Yes.

67
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:16,290
I think that the sjw phenomena is 
different and I think it is associated 

68
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,581
at least in part with the rise of women 
to political power and and we don't know

69
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:25,651
what women are like when they have 
political power because they've never 

70
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:27,160
had it.
I mean there's been queens obviously and

71
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:32,161
that sort of thing.
Just being female authority figures and 

72
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:34,291
females have wielded far more power 
historically than feminists generally 

73
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:38,041
like to admit,
but this is a different thing and we 

74
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,861
don't know what,
what truly female political philosophy 

75
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:41,140
would be like,
but it might be,

76
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,620
especially if it's not been well 
examined and it isn't very sophisticated

77
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:46,090
conceptually.
It could easily be,

78
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,910
but let's make sure things are 
distributed equally well.

79
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:53,911
Yeah,
but sorry that that's just not gonna 

80
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:53,911
fly.

81
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:57,530
Do you think in terms of the west with 
sjws and you talked about last lecture 

82
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,980
as well,
creating chaos when there is none.

83
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:02,040
Otherwise it'd be Sadek.
Do you think there would be any validity

84
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:06,420
in saying that in a country like Canada 
where we're pretty gender equal,

85
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,840
is there any merit to thinking sjws are 
trying to create chaos even when they're

86
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,540
arguably is none on a mass level?
Obviously there's still problems.

87
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,570
Why would they do that?
Otherwise it would be static.

88
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,830
Well it wouldn't,
but I'm just wondering is this,

89
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,680
I read this quote once and I don't 
remember who,

90
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,340
who said it,
it might've been Robert Heinlein for 

91
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:31,500
crying out loud science fiction author 
that springs to mind,

92
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:32,760
but it probably,
it probably wasn't.

93
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,500
And the proposition was that man tested 
ideas and women tested men and I kind of

94
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:41,820
liked that.
There's something about that,

95
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:46,821
you know,
and now it obviously it's an 

96
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:48,261
overgeneralization,
but we also don't know to what degree 

97
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:52,370
women test men.
Surely through provo provocation it's a 

98
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:52,890
lot because like if you want to test 
someone,

99
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,160
you don't have a little conversation 
with Mike,

100
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,730
you poke the hell out of them and you 
see,

101
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:59,250
okay,
like I'm gonna like go after you and see

102
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:02,280
where your weak spots are.
And it seems to me that this.

103
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,580
It seems to me that in this constant 
protest and use of shame and all of 

104
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,180
that,
that goes along with this,

105
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,630
with this sort of radical movement 
towards egalitarianism,

106
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:16,950
that there's a tremendous amount of 
provocation and go on.

107
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,810
I'm going to say this too,
even though I shouldn't,

108
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,600
but it.
But we met her.

109
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,250
I don't believe this,
but I'm trying trying to figure it out.

110
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,400
You know,
I thought it was absolutely comical when

111
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,510
50 shades of gray movie that just.
I just thought that was just so insanely

112
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:35,511
comical that at the same time there's 
this massive political demand for like 

113
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,180
radical equality and and say with 
regards to sexual behavior and the 

114
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:46,551
fastest selling novel the world had ever
seen was snm domination.

115
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,880
Right?
It's like,

116
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,970
oh,
well we didn't know where the 

117
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:52,970
unconscious is going with that one.
Don't leave.

118
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,350
And sometimes I think like because one 
of the things that I've really tried to 

119
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,600
puzzle out and it's like I believe this,
right?

120
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,550
I'm just telling you what I've,
where the edges of my thinking have been

121
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:06,551
going is that you have this crazy 
alliance between the feminists and the 

122
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:07,850
radical Islamists that I just do not 
get.

123
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,850
It's like the feminist is like why they 
aren't protesting nonstop about Saudi 

124
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Arabia is just completely beyond me.
Like I do not understand it in the 

125
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,890
least.
And I wonder too,

126
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:22,160
I just wonder bloody wellis this is the 
fruit in me is like,

127
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,220
is there an attraction,
you know,

128
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:29,221
the,
is there an attraction that's emerging 

129
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,820
among the female radicals for that 
totalitarian male dominance that they've

130
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:35,150
chased out of the West?
And I mean that's a hell of the thing to

131
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:36,680
think,
but I am after all,

132
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:41,300
I am a psychoanalytically minded and I 
do think things like that because like I

133
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:45,800
just can see no rational reason for it.
The only other rational reason is that,

134
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,860
well,
the West needs to fall and so the enemy 

135
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,130
of my enemy is,
or the is exactly.

136
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,620
Now what is it the,
I got that wrong.

137
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:56,630
But the enemy of enemy is my friend.

138
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,480
Yes,
exactly.

139
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,720
Elements tend to vote liberal as well.
Yeah,

140
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,810
as well so that that could be the case,
but I are not going to shake my 

141
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,801
suspicion about the this unconscious 
balancing because as the demand for 

142
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:13,871
egalitarianism and the eradication of 
masculinity accelerates,

143
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,660
there's going to be a longing in the 
unconscious for the precise opposite of 

144
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,240
that.
Right.

145
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,390
The more you will scream for equality,
the more your unconscious is going to 

146
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,880
admire dominance and so.
Well,

147
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,780
that's,
that's,

148
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,670
that's well,
that's how you think.

149
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:33,900
If you're a psychoanalytically minded 
and you know,

150
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,620
I'm a great admirer of Freud,
he knew a hell of a lot more than people

151
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:39,800
like to think and so,
which is partly why everyone still hates

152
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:42,420
them even though it's been 100 years 
since he's really,

153
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,640
really been around.
So.

154
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,950
All right,
we should stop.
