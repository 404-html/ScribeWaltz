1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,020
And then behind those two things,
behind the shadow and the anima and the 

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,180
Animus,
there is a final archetype,

3
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:09,480
which is the archetype of the self and 
that's young,

4
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:14,481
believed that the self was what you were
as a totality and that's a hard thing to

5
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:15,880
understand,
but,

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,100
but you could think about it this way.
You could think about the self as the,

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,820
as the total of what you are now,
plus the total of all those things that 

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,741
you could still be.
So it would be you as a reality plus us 

9
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:32,820
potential.
And that's a strange idea,

10
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:37,821
right?
Because we don't really know how to 

11
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:40,011
understand the idea of potential as 
modern empirical people because 

12
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:43,950
potential virtually by definition is not
yet manifest.

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,310
And also not a straightforward thing to 
either measure or conceptualized.

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,700
By the same token,
everybody acts as if they're,

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,820
they have potential unrealized 
potential.

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,210
And so young generated up a category to 
account for that which he felt was 

17
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:07,950
expressed in all sorts of symbolic 
weight.

18
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:11,640
So for example,
the wise old man,

19
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:16,641
like,
like the wizards in the movies that all 

20
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:18,270
of you have seen in the last five years.
It's always the same wizard.

21
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:23,271
Sometimes it's even the same actor.
It's like that's an archetype of the 

22
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:27,111
wise old man and for young Christ was an
archetype of the self as well and I.

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,860
I told you why that was to some degree 
and it's partly because the phoenix is 

24
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,571
also an archetype of the self because 
the Phoenix is something that can die 

25
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:41,931
and be reborn and so the Phoenix stands 
for the part of your personality that 

26
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:45,921
can let one thing go.
One part of you which is in the live 

27
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:49,701
part,
can let that go and burn up so to speak 

28
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:52,881
so that something new can be born 
because you very seldom gain something 

29
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,490
before you let something else go,
but that's partly because what you 

30
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,721
already assume can be the worst 
impediment that you have to to learning 

31
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,620
something new.

32
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,670
And it's complicated because sometimes 
what you know worked in the past,

33
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,370
you know,
so you can think about that.

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Maybe you're a perfectly well adapted 11
year old and you're still acting that 

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,860
way when you're 15.
It's like,

36
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:21,861
well,
it's hard to let that go because it 

37
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:21,861
worked and you put a lot of effort into 
it,

38
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,290
but unless you let it go,
the new personality isn't going to be 

39
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,940
able to manifest itself,
so you have to stop being a child before

40
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,730
you can be an adult and there is a 
sacrifice that goes along with that.

41
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:34,890
It's also a sacrifice that parents have 
to make,

42
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:39,891
right?
Because in order for a parent to 

43
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:42,240
encourage you to adopt the 
responsibilities of an individual,

44
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,270
they have to allow you as a child to 
die.

45
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,990
And Freud's observation on that 
phenomena was that many parents and he 

46
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:59,271
believed this was particularly 
characteristic of mothers because of 

47
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:02,691
their tight bond with their children and
the dependency that that implies that it

48
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:09,991
was particularly difficult for a mother 
to let her child die so that an adult 

49
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:12,670
could manifest itself in that child's 
place.

50
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,330
And that's fundamentally in many ways 
the EDA pool complex.

51
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,090
Okay,
so now I'm going to show you some of 

52
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,891
these things again,
because the thing about young is that 

53
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:30,030
it's not easy to understand what he has 
to say and it's not a simple thing to 

54
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,680
explain it,
and his books are complicated,

55
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,430
although I don't think there are any 
more complicated than they have to be.

56
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,490
Like I don't think young is obscure.
I think he's just difficult and then 

57
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,840
beyond difficult.
He's actually frightening.

58
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,900
So there's lots of reasons that people 
don't like you.
