1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,910
So here you go.
This is from the wonderlic people there,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,920
a commercial company that makes general 
cognitive ability tests and it's often 

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,660
used by corporations even though it's 
actually illegal,

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,990
it's actually illegal to use Iq tests,
but the wonderlic doesn't promote 

5
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:23,661
themselves as testing Iq.
I think they think it's general 

6
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:23,661
cognitive ability,
which is the same thing,

7
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:26,250
but whatever the sats,
the Gres,

8
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:28,230
the lsats,
all of those are Iq tests.

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,850
So now they're more crystallized than 
fluid and we'll get to that in a minute.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,460
But crystallized knowledge is what you 
accrue across type.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,150
So you could say that fluid intelligence
is what programs your brain,

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,780
it fills it with facts.
Let's say it fills it with knowledge and

13
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:47,781
then.
But you can get an estimate of your 

14
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:47,850
intelligence by sampling your domain of 
factual knowledge.

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,890
And the reason for that is that while 
obviously the better the programmer,

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,100
the better the content.

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,170
And so what that also means is that you 
can,

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,520
you could,
if you were prefrontal cortex was 

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,680
damaged later in life,
your fluid Iq could plummet,

20
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:04,080
but you're crystallized.
Iq remain more or less intact.

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,410
So even though they're not different,
one produces the other and then once the

22
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:14,781
producer has produced,
then the producer can disappear and you 

23
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:18,150
still got the uncoated knowledge.
So at least that's how it looks to me.

24
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,500
So.
Okay.

25
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:22,620
So how smart do you have to be to be 
different things in life?

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,240
Well,
if you have an Iq of 100,

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,930
16 to 130,
which is 85th percentile and above.

28
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:34,770
So it's one person in eight up to one 
person in 1:30,

29
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:36,840
I believe is 85,
90 95.

30
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:38,820
Is it 95?
90 five.

31
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,380
One person a to one person in 20.
Then you can be a attorney,

32
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,990
a research analyst and editor and 
advertising manager,

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,360
a chemist,
an engineer and executive manager,

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:48,990
et Cetera.

35
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,400
That's,
that's the,

36
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,880
that's not the high end for ICU by the 
way.

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,370
You know that it can go up.
Well,

38
00:01:56,371 --> 00:02:01,371
it can go up indefinitely,
although there's fewer and fewer people 

39
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,161
as it goes up.
So if you want to be the best at what 

40
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:04,500
you're doing,
bar none,

41
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,950
then having an Iq of above 145 is a 
necessity.

42
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:11,470
And maybe you're pushing one 60 in some 
situations and maybe that's me.

43
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,980
Make a new one person in 10,000
or even one person in 100,000.

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,240
And then also to really be good at it,
you probably have to be reasonably 

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,270
stress tolerant and also somewhat 
conscientious.

46
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,510
So people you think,
well why is it that smart people are at 

47
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:31,551
the top of dominance hierarchies?
And the answer to that in part is 

48
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:31,551
because they get their first,
right.

49
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,690
I mean everything's a race roughly 
speaking.

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,960
And the faster you are,
the more likely you are to be at the 

51
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,080
forefront of the pack.
And intelligence in large part is speed.

52
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,140
That's not all of it is.
So if you're moving towards something 

53
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,440
difficult rapidly,
the faster people are going to get there

54
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:49,950
first.
So Iq of 1:15,

55
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,150
1:10
to 1:15,

56
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:52,840
so that's 80,
fifth to 73rd,

57
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,110
85th percentile.
Copywriter,

58
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:56,250
accountant,
manager,

59
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,010
sales manager,
sales analysts,

60
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,210
manager,
person,

61
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,900
purchasing agent,
registered nurse,

62
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,740
sales account executive.
If you look at universities,

63
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,960
the smartest people are,
they're above this.

64
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:09,490
Who are the smartest people at 
University?

65
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,450
What do you think?

66
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,760
Mathematicians,
physicists,

67
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:14,840
and mathematicians.
Right?

68
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,450
Right.
I can tell you who's on the other end,

69
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:22,040
but I won't.
Yeah,

70
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,800
I'd like to though.
Anyway.

71
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,700
Anyways.
Okay.

72
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,720
Going down the wondering three to one,
a way to slightly above average,

73
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:31,700
right?
Sixtieth to 70th percentile,

74
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,230
store manager,
bookkeeper,

75
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:34,520
credit clerk,
lab test,

76
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:36,140
or general sales,
telephone sales,

77
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:37,910
accounting clerk,
computer operator,

78
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:39,500
customer service Rep,
technician,

79
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:40,190
clerk,
typist.

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,400
So you see at this level people are.
People have some technical skill and 

81
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,370
some ability to deal with complex 
things.

82
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,450
Okay.
That's dead.

83
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:52,340
Average hundred is average dispatcher in
a general office.

84
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:55,430
Police patrol officer,
receptionist,

85
00:03:55,431 --> 00:04:00,431
cashier,
general clerical inside sales clerk 

86
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:00,431
meter reader,
printer teller,

87
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:00,710
data entry,
electrical helper,

88
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,550
95th to 98 machinists,
food partner manager,

89
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:08,500
quality control checkers,
security guard,

90
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:10,240
unskilled labor maintenance,
arc,

91
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:11,680
welder,
die setter mechanic.

92
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,950
Good,
good Iq range for relatively qualified 

93
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,090
tradespeople.
80 seven to 93 messenger,

94
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,940
factory production worker Assembler,
food service worker,

95
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:23,170
nurses aid,
warehouseman,

96
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,430
custodian,
janitor,

97
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,020
material handler,
packer.

98
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:31,230
Now what you're seeing,
what you're starting to see is that as 

99
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:31,570
you move down the hierarchy,
the jobs get simpler.

100
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,720
They're more likely to be assigned by 
other people or the repetitive because 

101
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,060
what Iq predicts to some degree is how 
rapidly you can learn something,

102
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:45,061
but once you've learned it,
it doesn't predict how necessarily how 

103
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:46,800
well you do at it,
and so the more repetitive jobs tend,

104
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,760
people with lower iqs are more suited to
more repetitive jobs under 87.

105
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,650
Is there something?
Well,

106
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,490
no,

107
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,350
right,
that's a big problem and it's something 

108
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,381
our society has not addressed at all.
Jobs for people with Iqs of less than 85

109
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,910
are very,
very rare.

110
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,520
So what the hell are those people 
supposed to do?

111
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,580
It's like one,
it's 15 percent of the population.

112
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,880
What are they supposed to do?
Well,

113
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,060
we better figure it out because one of 
the things that's happening too is that 

114
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,241
as the,
as the High Iq tech geeks get a hold of 

115
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,991
the world,
the demand for cognitive power is 

116
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:27,991
increasing,
not decreasing,

117
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:28,390
right?
You want to be a teller.

118
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,640
Well,
you know those checkout machines,

119
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,580
they're not so simple.
You want to work at Mcdonald's.

120
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:38,581
You think that's a simple job.
You don't see robots working at 

121
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:40,981
Mcdonald's and the reason for that is 
that what Mcdonald's workers do is too 

122
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:43,630
complex for for robots to do so

123
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,200
well.
So this is a discussion that no one 

124
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,200
wants to have,
but that's okay.

125
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,620
It's still a problem and it has to be 
dealt with.

126
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,860
So the US government,
I think I told you this at one point 

127
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,471
already,
it's illegal to induct anyone into the 

128
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,471
US army if they have an Iq of less than 
83,

129
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:07,030
right?
It's about 10 percent of the population 

130
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,600
because the US army and they'd be doing 
Iq testing since Iq testing began 

131
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,530
because they want everybody they can 
possibly get into the army because in 

132
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,731
peace time they use it as a way of 
moving people up the socioeconomic 

133
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:20,930
ladder and in war time.
Well obviously you need as many soldiers

134
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:25,931
as you can get your hands on and so 
you're not going to be any pickier than 

135
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:27,280
you have to be.
So when the U,

136
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:30,650
s army says it's illegal to induct 
anybody into the armed forces.

137
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,650
If they have an Iq of less than 83,
then you know that they've done it for 

138
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,380
absolute necessity.
Right?

139
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:41,381
And when people have made a finding that
contradicts what they want to hear and 

140
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:42,590
they're doing it out of absolute 
necessity,

141
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,740
you can be reasonably true that it's one
of those facts that just won't bloody 

142
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:47,750
well go away.
And so you might think,

143
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:52,751
well,
if there's nothing for someone with an 

144
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:54,791
Iq of less than 83 to do in the army,
what makes you think that there's 

145
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:55,190
something that they can do in the 
general population?

146
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,550
And then the issue is because the 
Conservatives will say,

147
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,560
well,
they should just work harder.

148
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:01,190
It's like,
sorry,

149
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:03,140
that ain't gonna fly.
And the liberals will say,

150
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:08,141
well,
there's no difference between people 

151
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:08,510
anyhow and you can just train people to 
do everything and that's wrong.

152
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,120
So they're both wrong and they're 
seriously wrong.

153
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,450
And the fact that neither side of the 
political perspective,

154
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:19,451
we'll take a good cold hard look at this
problem means that we're going to 

155
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:23,171
increasingly have a structural problem 
in our societies because we're 

156
00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:26,411
complexifying everything so rapidly that
you can't find employment unless 

157
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,250
increasingly,
unless you're intelligent,

158
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:29,930
you guys are really going to face this.
You know,

159
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,110
lawyers are disappearing like mad.
And the reason for that is you can look 

160
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,530
it up online.
Increasingly.

161
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:38,570
You can do things yourself if you're 
smart.

162
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:44,050
And so like the working class people 
have been wiped out pretty nicely over 

163
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,980
the last 30 years by by automation and 
various other things.

164
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,460
It's the low end of the white collar 
class that's coming up next.

165
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,010
So I'm not saying that lawyers lawyers 
are in the low end,

166
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:55,820
but low end lawyers are in the low end 
of the white collar class.

167
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,240
So there's still going to be plenty of 
positions for people who are creative 

168
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,150
and fast on their feet and super smart.
In fact,

169
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:07,151
those people are going to have all the 
money that's already happening to a 

170
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:07,151
great degree,
you know,

171
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:09,260
because if you're smart and you can use 
a computer,

172
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,720
you're so smart.
It's just absolutely unbelievable.

173
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,540
Right.
And if you can't use a computer and lots

174
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,950
of people,
and I don't mean,

175
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,040
you know,
you can open word that isn't what I 

176
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,040
mean.
I mean maybe,

177
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,281
I mean you can program and if you can't 
program while you're right at the next 

178
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:26,510
and so if you haven't got that with you,
you're,

179
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,460
you're gonna be left behind.

180
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,080
Oh,
lot of them will take demerol.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,600
That's what's happening in the United 
States.

182
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,680
Yeah,
it's an opiate.

183
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,610
Yeah.
So there's a massive drug problem 

184
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:44,610
emerging and.

185
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

186
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,010
No,
I'm telling you,

187
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:48,180
that is what's happening there.

188
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,840
Yes.
Drugs.

189
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,470
Yeah.
Drugs of abuse.

190
00:08:59,340 --> 00:08:59,820
Well,
that.

191
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,660
What is happening to a large degree is 
people drop out of the employment race.

192
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,240
They get very depressed.
They develop chronic pain problems,

193
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:11,241
especially if they're men,
because chronic pain and depression are 

194
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:14,451
very much the same thing.
And then they subsist on opiates which 

195
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:15,990
are subsidized by Medicaid in the US.
I'm not kidding about this.

196
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:17,530
This is exactly what's happening.
What,

197
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,340
what else is going to happen to people 
for whom there is nothing to do.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,400
They have a terrible time,
especially if they're conscientious.

199
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,110
That's a good question.
You know the Ai guys are pushing hard on

200
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,680
this.
Hey,

201
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,800
what's the biggest employment category 
driver?

202
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,900
Think about it.
What's Tesla doing?

203
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,410
What are all the ai guys working on as 
fast as they possibly can?

204
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,900
Driverless cars,
no problem.

205
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,210
Except that's the biggest employment 
category for men.

206
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,510
So what are those guys going to do?
Yeah,

207
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,570
they're going to sit home and be 
miserable with their wives and take 

208
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:57,570
opiates because they have chronic pain 
problems,

209
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,810
right?
Nasty,

210
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,740
and you might think,
well,

211
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:01,600
could they think of something else to 
do?

212
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,750
Well,
if you have an Iq of 83 or less,

213
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:07,720
you're not going to be doing a lot of 
thinking about something else to do.

214
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,900
You know?
That isn't how it works because you're 

215
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:12,970
more of a.
you're an act person,

216
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:15,400
not a thinking person,
roughly speaking,

217
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,470
you know,
and so if you have a task at hand,

218
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,410
especially if you're conscientious,
you can diligently go about it,

219
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,770
but you know,
I've tried to train people with Iqs of 

220
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,140
80 and less to do what I would consider 
tasks that,

221
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,280
that,
that one of you could learn to do in 10 

222
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,641
minutes and never make a mistake again.
And it's like tens of hours with bare 

223
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:40,660
minimum mastery of the tasks.
So it's ugly situation,

224
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,590
no doubt about it.
