1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:00,530
Yeah,
no,

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,570
I want to come back also to what you 
were saying about the predictive power 

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,061
of Iq and conscientiousness,
which I don't dispute that I'm also not 

4
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:14,351
one of these people who suffers under 
the delusion that these things are 

5
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:15,050
totally open quotes,
socially determined,

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,130
closed quotes.
I mean,

7
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:21,131
I understand and believe that they have 
high heritability and identifiable 

8
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:24,440
genetic sources in that variability and 
so on.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,110
But you know,
the standard old joke used to be,

10
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:32,111
you can tell because you don't worry 
about personality psychology that I do 

11
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:32,111
at the standard old junk used to be that
everything,

12
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:33,380
everything's 50 percent heritable,
that,

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,840
that,
that pretty much anything that you could

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,770
measure as a trait that has any 
stability within the lifetime also turns

15
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:42,430
out to have a heritability somewhere to 
your point five.

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,690
But there's the other point five of,
you know,

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,760
some people have low iqs because they 
were exposed to too much.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,570
They see,
you know,

19
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,910
um,
I believe that conscientiousness,

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,930
this can probably be like,
I believe you suggested earlier that we 

21
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:09,221
know something about this already about 
developmental determinative of shifts in

22
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:11,650
conscientious.
And uh,

23
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,390
so,
you know,

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,490
we have to caution ourselves against 
talking about these individual 

25
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,020
difference factors as if they are a 
beautiful attributes of individuals that

26
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:26,021
are going to undermine Eddie,
sort of progressive improvement of,

27
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,180
of circumstances for people are,
are,

28
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:29,700
are,
are,

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,790
are,
are going to create bad byproducts of 

30
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,980
attempts to produce social justice.
It's just gonna you know,

31
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,540
you're going to leave your country and 
just people out there being parasites or

32
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:41,900
something

33
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:48,370
there,
there is of course decent evidence that 

34
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,730
there's cultural effects on Iq,
I mean the flynn effect,

35
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,740
which is named after the man who,
who described the,

36
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,670
the,
the,

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,760
the phenomena indicates that the average
Iq has been increasing quite 

38
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:03,850
substantially over the last hundred 
years.

39
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:07,270
And the reason for that,
no one knows for sure,

40
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,450
but one of the putative reasons for that
is that we've lifted the bottom out of 

41
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,400
catastrophe.
So there aren't people whose Iq is,

42
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:20,401
are stunted by,
by exposure to zero information during 

43
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,560
critical developmental periods and who 
didn't get enough to eat.

44
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,140
Yes.
I was going to say superior about 

45
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,140
nutrition.
Everybody probation.

46
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,140
Yeah,

47
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,140
yeah,
exactly.

48
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,380
Exactly.
So we've,

49
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,580
we've wiped out in many ways,
we've wiped out the worst effects of 

50
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,660
privation and that's increasingly true 
as well on,

51
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,710
on the worldwide scale worldwide stage,
you know there's about 150,000

52
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:48,910
people a day right now being lifted out 
of absolute poverty by UN standards,

53
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,970
the fastest improvement in the history 
of the world by a huge margin and also 

54
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,751
about 300,000
people a day being hooked up to the 

55
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:58,690
electrical grid.
So we are making some progress,

56
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,160
removing the absolute privation problem,
which is a nontrivial problem.

57
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,970
The problem with most of the attempts to
raise Iq is that they don't change the 

58
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,710
variance in Iq.
They tend to raise the average Iq across

59
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:16,711
the population and that leaves the 
inequality of Iq inequality problem 

60
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:21,481
basically untouched.
So there have been studies trying to 

61
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:23,980
estimate how much socioeconomic 
pressure,

62
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,010
let's say you have to place on an 
individual to raise their iq lowering.

63
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,600
It's easy,
right?

64
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,030
Because making something worse is always
easier than making something better.

65
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,440
But if I remember correctly,
if you take a,

66
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,690
an identical twin who's adopted out at 
birth in order to produce a 15 point 

67
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,460
increase in Iq compared to the other 
twin,

68
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,360
which is a one standard deviation 
increase and about the same as the 

69
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,280
average difference between a university 
student in a,

70
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,290
in an average state college and an 
average high school student,

71
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,620
you have to move the one twin from the 
fifth percentile of socioeconomic status

72
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:07,111
to the 95th percentile.
So you need about a three standard 

73
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:10,981
deviation improvement and socioeconomic 
conditions to produce a one standard 

74
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:14,200
deviation improvement in Icu.
So it looks like it can be done,

75
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:16,000
but it's.
But it's expensive,

76
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,260
you know,
and

77
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,740
I see,
I see what you're saying.

78
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:23,120
I'm kind of surprised I'm actually,
I've been given,

79
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:28,330
you know,
we just mentioned malnutrition as one 

80
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:28,700
possible source of low Iq.
What possible developmental source.

81
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,260
I'm Kinda surprised that,
uh,

82
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,600
to the degree that the flit effect might
be due to things like,

83
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:36,590
or reduction of the number of people 
exposed to severe malnutrition,

84
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,220
that it wouldn't have also 
simultaneously truncated the variance a 

85
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,310
little bit.
That seems like they said,

86
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:43,400
well,

87
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,180
sorry,
let me restate that.

88
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,150
It has truncated.
It has truncated the variance,

89
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:52,510
although the data on that isn't clear 
isn't as clear,

90
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:53,740
but so,
but,

91
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,890
but I,
I do believe that it's a reasonable 

92
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:58,890
inference to make that the variance has 
been truncated.

93
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,911
It's also hidden to some degree because 
the Iq tests are always renewed them to 

94
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:05,100
keep the variance out of standard 15 
points so.

95
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:10,101
So it makes it difficult to look 
retrospectively and see what's happened 

96
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,830
to the variance.
So by the time,

97
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,900
the other problem too is that,
you know,

98
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:18,901
you get these stories now and then about
these companies that come out with the 

99
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,130
claims that their brain exercises can 
improve Iq and the literature on that is

100
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:26,131
damn dismal.
I can tell you it's that the holy grail 

101
00:05:26,131 --> 00:05:29,371
is to produce cognitive exercises that 
produce a legitimate impact on fluid 

102
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,960
intelligence and,
and like there's been a lot of work done

103
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:35,290
on that and the answer is so far is that
it doesn't work.

104
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,200
What about,
what about like video gaming?

105
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:43,230
I mean,
I know there has been this suggestion 

106
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,151
that playing video games actually 
improves at least some aspects of 

107
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:49,321
intelligence.
There's a couple of studies that 

108
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:49,321
indicated that video games might improve
spatial intelligence,

109
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:49,820
but,
but here's

110
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:55,090
problem and I think this is,
this is a critical problem or perhaps an

111
00:05:55,191 --> 00:06:00,191
insoluble one or at least no one's 
solved is that what you get is that if 

112
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,971
you are,
if you exercise yourself substantially 

113
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:06,821
on a given game,
you can radically accelerate your 

114
00:06:06,821 --> 00:06:09,041
performance in the game so you can get 
much better at those specific skill 

115
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:12,581
share,
but you don't get generalization across 

116
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:12,820
cognitive sets,
which is what you're really hoping for.

117
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,070
Because I thought,
I thought that was the claim for some.

118
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,410
They have shown some increases in 
spatial Iq,

119
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:22,400
but there's not very many studies.
And I would say they're far overbalanced

120
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,640
by the other side of the research 
equation,

121
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:30,641
which continually says,
and I've looked at this because I'm 

122
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,610
really interested in the improvement of 
ICU.

123
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,240
I mean,
that's,

124
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,400
that's the holy grail in some sense.
And that,

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,840
and,
and,

126
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:37,030
uh,
the,

127
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,700
the,
the overwhelming preponderance of 

128
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,311
evidence suggests that you don't get 
generalization outside the narrow 

129
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:46,040
domain.
Now why that is,

130
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,100
and even this,
it's even worse say because you might 

131
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,100
say,
well,

132
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,130
imagine that you could take five 
different domains of intelligence still 

133
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,190
associated type with,
with Jay,

134
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:59,960
and you had people practice routines in 
all five dimensions.

135
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,900
Maybe you'd get generalization under 
those circumstances.

136
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:04,080
And the,
the,

137
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,310
the,
the results of the research attempting 

138
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,681
that indicate that no,
as soon as you move away from those 

139
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,560
specific practice instances,
you don't get generalization.
