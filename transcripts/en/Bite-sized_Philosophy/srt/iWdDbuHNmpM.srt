1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,540
The thing is,
whenever I look at a political movement,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,560
especially ideological,
I think,

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,950
okay,
there's a bunch of things your for fine,

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,470
what are you against?
You know,

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,650
because one of the things that people 
who adopted need theological position,

6
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:20,651
like to presume is that all of the right
is on their site and that makes them 

7
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:23,780
very unconscious up their shadow.
Let's say from a union perspective.

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,110
The Nazis had all sorts of positive 
reasons for what they were doing,

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,050
but you know,
the negative reasons were there too and 

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,151
you could easily make it a case that the
negative reasons were really the 

11
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:36,370
reasons.
And when I look at video logs,

12
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:37,120
I always think,
yeah,

13
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:39,280
yeah,
that's what you're for sure,

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,030
but I don't believe all the good people 
are on your site and be.

15
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:46,000
I know that negative motivations are 
more powerful than positive ones.

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,540
So you say you're for things,
but you're against them too.

17
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,310
So let's,
let's start with that.

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,290
So I thought I started thinking about 
this after I read George Orwell.

19
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,170
I love George Orwell,
by the way.

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,700
How many of you know who George Orwell 
is?

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,200
Wow.
Really?

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,720
That's impressive.
How many don't.

23
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,330
Okay,
well that's,

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,620
that's good.
That's amazing.

25
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,440
How the hell did you learn about George 
Orwell's?

26
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,180
Nineteen 84.
Fundamentally,

27
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:15,580
or animal farm?
Animal Farm.

28
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,360
Okay.
Okay.

29
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:18,320
Well that's good because George Orwell,
man,

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,360
I tell you,
George Orwell was the first western 

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,400
intellectual who figured out what the 
hell was going on in the Soviet Union.

32
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,880
And he did that in the mid forties,
early.

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,080
You know what was complicated because we
sort of knew what was happening in the 

34
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,640
twenties and the thirties,
you know,

35
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:35,140
there was lennon and that wasn't so 
good.

36
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:40,141
There was the Russian civil war,
there was the idea of universal 

37
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,440
communism that wasn't such a good idea,
you know,

38
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:46,441
for,
as far as people who didn't want to be 

39
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:47,941
communists were concerned.
And then there was what happened in the 

40
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:47,941
Ukraine in the 1930.
So it was like,

41
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,750
you know,
the evidence was starting to pile up.

42
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:54,751
But unfortunately what happened was the 
Spanish civil war and the lefties were 

43
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:57,580
pretty much the good guys in the Spanish
civil war.

44
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,610
Right.
It was like a microcosm of the Second 

45
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,341
World War.
The lefties were fighting the fascists 

46
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:08,790
and some of the lefties were communists,
but a lot of them were also people who 

47
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,331
were,
I think genuinely fighting for freedom 

48
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:14,850
and a lot of North American literary 
figures went to Spain to fight on the 

49
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,250
side of the.

50
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,630
No,
you know,

51
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,790
against the fascists.
And so fair enough,

52
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,290
you know,
the fascist were obviously,

53
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,260
you know,
reprehensible clearly and so and so that

54
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:29,560
kind of muddied the water right because 
the fastest were bad.

55
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:31,540
And then that sort of means that people 
that are fighting them,

56
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:34,180
their garden and some of them are 
communists and there was good.

57
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,070
There was pretty good reason for people 
to be radical socialist at that point in

58
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:43,420
human history because the plight of the 
working man was relatively unpleasant.

59
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,750
George Orwell wrote a book called road 
to Wigan Pier and he went up to this 

60
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:54,181
town that was a coal mining town and he,
he stayed with the coal miners for 

61
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,680
awhile and just looked at their life.
So here,

62
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:56,710
here's a part of their life.

63
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,300
So you work at seven and a half hour 
shift when you're a coal miner and you 

64
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,300
think,
oh,

65
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,810
that's not too bad by 1930 standards.
It's like,

66
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:09,811
yeah,
except you have to go down to the coal 

67
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:11,410
mine tunnels,
you know,

68
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:16,330
and like they're not eight feet high and
carpeted there like four and a half feet

69
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:19,330
high and rough and poorly lit and the 
ers terrible.

70
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,720
And so basically you have to chimp walk 
or crawl up to three miles just to get 

71
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:32,761
to work and then you have to do that at 
the end of your shift and you don't get 

72
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:33,370
paid for that.
That's just,

73
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,250
that's your commute,
right?

74
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,020
Right.
So you know,

75
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:43,021
it was no bloody well.
And then of course what you're doing 

76
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:43,021
when you get there,
it's like it's absolutely filthy.

77
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,250
It's unbelievably noisy.
It's brutally difficult.

78
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:48,590
He said the coal miners,
they have no teeth because they're like,

79
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,910
because of their living conditions,
but their bodies were absolutely 

80
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,910
perfect.

81
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,360
They were unbelievably powerful and 
strong because all they did was 

82
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,560
incredibly intense physical labor,
but it was bloody rough.

83
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,800
And the housing,
those people had like 50 families for 

84
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:10,321
one outhouse,
that's probably good enough to describe 

85
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:12,631
it.
And often they were row houses and the 

86
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:14,440
row houses had no back doors that may 
add no pass between them.

87
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:19,441
And all the old houses were at the back.
So that meant if you were was like 20 

88
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:19,660
below and it was the winter and you were
sick,

89
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:22,620
then you get to go all the way around 
the block to your damn.

90
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,660
I will tell us where maybe there's only 
one there and you line up with 50 people

91
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,880
so that.
Yeah.

92
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:32,440
So in order while he was orwell was an 
upper class guy basically,

93
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:36,840
and he was trying to help themselves 
overcome these upperclass prejudices who

94
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:41,841
is a real documentary,
one of the terrible working conditions 

95
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:41,841
of,
of,

96
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:42,640
of working class people.

97
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,390
And he wrote this book called Road to 
Wigan Pier.

98
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,430
But one of the things that or will said,
he wrote this story about these poor God

99
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:53,230
damn coal miners and you think,
well yeah,

100
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:58,231
it's like how about some social 
legislation so that these people and 

101
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,600
their children aren't just absolutely 
brutalized nonstop.

102
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,720
You know.
But then he wrote the last half of the 

103
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:04,780
book and he wrote it for the left book 
club,

104
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:07,570
which was a socialist group that we 
publish a book every month or so.

105
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,320
And what he did was he.
He wrote a critique of socialism of 

106
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,770
pretty socialism and he said,
yeah,

107
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:17,200
well this sucks man.
It's like we should be on the.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,560
Sorry to these working people,
but the social assigned meet,

109
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,000
they're not on the side of the working 
people.

110
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:27,001
They're like tweed wearing middle class 
hyper intellectuals who never go 

111
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,960
anywhere near the working class because 
of their class.

112
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,020
Prejudice isn't for all sorts of other 
reasons and they don't like the poor at 

113
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,020
all.

114
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,000
They just hate the rich.
And I thought I had been a member of the

115
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,620
NDP for a long time.
At that point.

116
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:40,150
It was always something a little off 
about it.

117
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:45,151
Especially the more radical kind that's 
with you guys is it doesn't look like 

118
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,420
benevolence as far as I can tell.
There's a lot of whining and complaining

119
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:50,500
and resentment.
It's like,

120
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,610
what's that?
What's that about?

121
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,970
I read Orwell and I thought,
right,

122
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,180
if you hate the successful,
if you hate the rich,

123
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:02,750
who are rich by the way is whoever has 
more money than you.

124
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,830
Right?
That's how you define rich and the best 

125
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,591
way to mask your resentment,
just to pretend that you're on the side 

126
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:11,900
of the poor.
And I read that.

127
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:16,901
I thought that's exactly right.
And then that's part of also what made 

128
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:19,991
me psychoanalytically oriented because 
one thing psychoanalysts always do 

129
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,290
always is if you say you're,
here's how I'm positively predisposed.

130
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,730
The psychoanalyst says,
how are you using that to mask something

131
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,730
easy and malevolent that you're doing?
And that's always.

132
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,710
That's a very,
very useful questions.

133
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:37,850
Not always correct,
right?

134
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,320
But,
but it's correct a lot more than people 

135
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,400
generally like to think,
you know,

136
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:48,401
it's like the mothering him grant the 
mother or the witch in Hansel and 

137
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:48,401
Gretel.
You know the story,

138
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,680
right?
This guy gets married,

139
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,040
he's got a couple of kids.
His new wife doesn't relate to the kids.

140
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,550
You have 100 times higher chance by the 
way of being abused by a step parent 

141
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,180
than the biological parent.
Just so you know,

142
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,080
so the step where they're just like the 
kids,

143
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,190
she tells the guy,
well,

144
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,120
why don't you just go with those kids 
out in the woods,

145
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:10,080
sold out.
They go out in the woods.

146
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,300
So they're lost kids,
right?

147
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:11,990
They have nowhere to go.

148
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,840
So when they're wandering around out 
there in the forest,

149
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,710
what happens?
They come across a gingerbread house.

150
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,540
You think,
wow man,

151
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,450
you're a starving kid.
Just your bread house.

152
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,950
That's good news,
right?

153
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:28,880
Not only is it a house,
but it's made out of candy.

154
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,400
How could anything possibly be any 
better?

155
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,940
So when they go,
well,

156
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:36,250
and then there's this grandmother type 
type and you know,

157
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,020
she's starts to fatten them up and she 
puts,

158
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,110
I think it's handling the cage and she 
gets settled after a while to basically 

159
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:49,421
work as their scullery maid and equip 
becomes quite obvious to the children 

160
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:52,511
that she's actually fattening them up so
that she can put them in the oven and 

161
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:55,171
eat them.
And so I think what Hansel does is I 

162
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:57,610
think gretel gives him this leg bone 
from some animal and the old,

163
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,830
which half blind and every time she 
reaches into sort feel is laying,

164
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,100
he gives her the bone and so like she's 
just not all that interested in meeting 

165
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,511
them in anyways.
The kids ended up pushing her in the 

166
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:10,511
oven and closing it and getting the hell
out of there.

167
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:14,381
So you know,
it's a happy ending as far as fairy 

168
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:14,381
tales school.
But it's an atypical story,

169
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:16,370
right?
It's a classic story,

170
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:20,930
but it needed whole family.
Be bloody wary of people who do too much

171
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:23,480
for you.
Right?

172
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,980
It's like if you have a mother or any 
other relatives for that matter,

173
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,740
who's fattening you up on mercy and 
candy,

174
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,640
the probability that her basic goal is 
to eat you enough so that you never 

175
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,081
leave.
The probability is extraordinarily high 

176
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:43,730
and that's no joke.
You know,

177
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,750
one of the things that you do learn if 
you read about the sorts of people who 

178
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,870
burst out of their mother's basement and
go shoot up Dawson colleges that often.

179
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,030
That's exactly the situation that you've
been,

180
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,450
right.
They're burning with resentment in their

181
00:08:57,451 --> 00:09:00,210
uselessness down in the basement for 
five or six years,

182
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,770
you know,
they don't have to leave,

183
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,680
they don't have to become independent,
everything's done for them.

184
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,230
So they never have to do anything for 
themselves.

185
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,560
It's like it's not pretty.
And so one of the rules for dealing with

186
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:18,051
people,
and I know this is actually a rule for 

187
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
dealing with elderly people in,
in,

188
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
in,
in,

189
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,800
in hopes for,
for,

190
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,100
for retired people,
is do not do anything for anyone they 

191
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,100
can do for themselves.

192
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,800
You are stealing from them when you do 
that.

193
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,420
And it's a great rule of thumb for kits.
Like once they can dress themselves,

194
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,970
they dress themselves.
If they can set the table,

195
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:35,520
even if it takes 20 minutes,
it's like they're setting the table.

196
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,700
You're not doing them a favor by helping
them do anything they can do themselves 

197
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,180
and it gets Kinda,
it's Kinda harsh,

198
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:47,181
you know,
but it beats the hell out of the witch 

199
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:47,181
in Hansel and Gretel.
So.

200
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:48,240
So anyways,
one of the things we're going to look at

201
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,790
as well as the dark side of positive 
motivations.
