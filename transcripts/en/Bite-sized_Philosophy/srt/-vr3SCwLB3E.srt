1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,540
Resentment for secure to comment on the 
apparently well established new.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,670
This idea that men have a collective 
common collective interests and women 

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,230
have a separate common collective 
interests class interest in these 

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,980
interests.
Are they to conflict?

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,880
There's a competition sometimes on a 
collective level.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,370
Well,
I think there is competition between men

7
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:26,770
and women,
but it's nested inside a broader arena.

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,620
Cooperation,
you know,

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,470
this is another thing that you learned 
from reading Psj if you're,

10
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:36,471
if you're careful this,
but because piaget was smart enough to 

11
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:39,321
understand that there is no dichotomous 
opposition between cooperation and 

12
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:40,740
competition.
So you know,

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,800
one of the sort of tenants of the kind 
of left this mumble jumble that I hate 

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,950
is that you should.
Kids shouldn't play competitive games,

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,230
right?
It should be cooperative games.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,070
It's like,
okay,

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,740
let's take that apart.
Let's take hockey.

18
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,650
Is it competitive or cooperative?

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,060
Well,
it's competitive.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,110
Well,
wait a second.

21
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,870
No one brings a basketball to the hockey
game,

22
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,330
right?
No one brings a chessboard.

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,630
Everyone that comes to the hockey game 
comes there to play hockey.

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,900
That constitutes cooperation.
We'll mutually define the aim or does 

25
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,160
any cooperation.
We'll mutually define the aim,

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,360
will assign each other rules,
we'll all agree to stick to the roles.

27
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,750
Well,
that's cooperation and if you break the 

28
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,301
rules,
what happens to you get stuck in the 

29
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:29,301
penalty box.
You're not playing hockey off you go.

30
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:31,260
And people,
people go off,

31
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,640
they go sit in the penalty box,
they don't go kill the referee,

32
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,720
they go and sit in the penalty box,
you know,

33
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,780
six foot seven slash 300 pounds.
So okay.

34
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:45,010
And then you think,
well what about within the team?

35
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,960
Cooperation or competition?
Well,

36
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,080
each team member is trying to be the 
best player but it try not passing to 

37
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:56,270
your colleagues and see what happens.
Even if you're really good,

38
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:58,850
they'll just,
you're just a diva and no one's going to

39
00:01:58,851 --> 00:01:59,960
be happy with,
you know,

40
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:02,360
they'll put horrible things in your beer
after the game.

41
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:08,110
So it's cooperation there as well.
And then there's a Meta level of 

42
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,640
cooperation which is that everybody's 
trying to improve their skills similar 

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,170
honestly and so that,
that serves a higher order good.

44
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,490
And everyone's trying to learn how to be
a good player so that they can play many

45
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:20,540
games.
It's like,

46
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,190
well,
we shouldn't play competitive games.

47
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,350
So like you must've been educated at 
noisey.

48
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,860
Sad.
It's very sad and it's so,

49
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,810
so ignorant for people who know 
something about child development to say

50
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:40,570
something like that.
It's just what is with you?

51
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Where were you educated?
Or where were you educated is the right 

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,450
response.
So,

53
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,290
and then so with men and women,
well there is group competition.

54
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,320
For example,
you're competing roughly speaking with 

55
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,320
all your classmates,
right?

56
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,200
And some of the women are going to 
outshine you.

57
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,450
And so that's,
that's tough for men.

58
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,810
It's particularly tough for men because 
it isn't obvious how you compete full 

59
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:09,241
bore with women.
It's not obvious and we don't know how 

60
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:09,241
to solve that problem.
