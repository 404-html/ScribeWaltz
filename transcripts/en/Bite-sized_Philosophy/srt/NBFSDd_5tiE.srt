1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,530
So you know,
now I want to talk about postmodernism a

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:07,880
little bit.
Well,

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,100
it seems to me that's my youth,
Michel Foucault in the Middle,

4
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:16,101
and the more reprehensible individual 
you could partly ever discover or even 

5
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:20,961
dream up,
no matter how twisted your imagination 

6
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:23,580
and a food co and Dera Dahlia would say,
there's more,

7
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:26,220
but I would say they're the two 
architects of the,

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,890
of the,
of the postmodernist movement,

9
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:33,891
and in brief,
I think what they did was in the late 

10
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:37,251
sixties and early seventies,
they were avowed Marxist some way low 

11
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:41,510
way after anyone with any shred of 
ethical decency had stopped being a 

12
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:46,521
Marxist by that time,
even John Paul Sartre and woken up 

13
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:49,851
enough to figure out that the Soviets 
hadn't ushered into the Kingdom of 

14
00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:53,900
Heaven.
Now he had evidence stretching back 45 

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,421
years that he could have attended to if 
he would have been willing to open his 

16
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:56,421
eyes,
talk about bad faith,

17
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:58,620
which was his ethical critique.

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,600
Essentially.
It's something quite staggering.

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,730
The postmodernists knew that they were 
pretty much done with regards to pushing

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
their classic Marxism by the late 
sixties in the early seventies because 

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,480
the evidence that Stella Russia not only
Stalinists,

22
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,530
certainly lennon was no,
no saint by any stretch of the 

23
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,801
imagination.
That killing certainly got underway 

24
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:23,850
while he was still alive and and 
continued after Stalin was dead as well,

25
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,450
although perhaps with not the same 
degree of brutality and efficiency.

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,660
And then there was a course Mao's China 
where the estimates,

27
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,350
you know,
nobody knows how many people died under 

28
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,511
mile,
but the estimates are run as high as 

29
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:38,511
$100,
million people,

30
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:43,491
which actually turns out to be quite a 
few people in the fact that we can't 

31
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:47,121
keep count accurately without an error 
margin of something in the tens of 

32
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:50,220
millions just tells you exactly how 
horrible the situation was.

33
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,140
They transformed the Marxist dialogue of
rich versus poor into oppressed versus 

34
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,890
oppressor and Fuko in particular,
who never fit in anywhere and who was an

35
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:06,020
outcast in many ways and a bitter one in
a suicidal one his entire life.

36
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,330
Did everything he possibly could with is
staggering Iq to figure out every 

37
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,381
treacherous way possible to undermine 
the structure that wouldn't accept him 

38
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:19,371
in all his peculiarity and it's no 
wonder because there would be no way of 

39
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:23,241
making a structure that could possibly 
function if it was composed of people 

40
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:25,470
who were as peculiar,
bitter and resentful as Michelle Foodco,

41
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,830
so you couldn't imagine this functioning
society that would be composed of 

42
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,730
individuals with his particular makeup.
In any case,

43
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,030
he did put his brain to work trying to 
figure out a way how to resurrect 

44
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,900
Marxism under a new guys,
let's say,

45
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:44,901
and B,
how to justify the fact that it wasn't 

46
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:46,950
his problem,
that he was an outsider.

47
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:51,951
It was actually everyone else's problem 
and he did a pretty damn good job of 

48
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:53,160
that.
Laid the groundwork for this,

49
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,170
for the,
what would you call it,

50
00:02:55,171 --> 00:03:00,171
the rise of the marginalized against the
center and is thinking is very much the 

51
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:00,910
same.

52
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,580
You know,
Derek,

53
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,840
even though my fuco and Derrida hated 
each other and regard each other as 

54
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,130
intellectual charlatans,
which was about the only thing either of

55
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:14,131
them was ever really correct about,
so Derrida was also dared in some ways 

56
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:22,921
is even more treacherous thinker because
he makes the claim in some sense that I 

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,940
a political system has a center around 
which the majority congregate.

58
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,860
Let's say it's,
it's,

59
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,760
it's quite similar to food co's analysis
and that there are,

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,880
there are people who are outside the 
category system and then which is 

61
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,920
obviously true because no matter how you
categorize people,

62
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,950
there are certain people inside the 
category and certain people outside.

63
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,650
That's actually why you categorize 
things,

64
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,950
right?
Because if every category holds every 

65
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:52,950
entity,
then every,

66
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,480
every cognitive operation is infinitely 
complex.

67
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,020
You can't manage that way to categorize.
You have to include an excluded.

68
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,050
It's the very nature of categorization 
and you can't just scrap categorization 

69
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,210
because without simplification and 
categorization,

70
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,220
you actually can't function in the 
world.

71
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,020
You just die,
right?

72
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:16,021
You die of excess stress.
It's something like something like that 

73
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:19,261
happens to schizophrenia people because 
their category systems break down and 

74
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:22,950
they're completely incapable of 
functioning in the world as a 

75
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,950
consequence of that.
Anyways.

76
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,880
Um,
then you know,

77
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,070
uh,
Derrida went and flew co as well,

78
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:30,820
went a step farther and this is one of 
the incredibly crooked elements of their

79
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:33,310
thinking.
I think another slight of hand which was

80
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,340
well category systems exclude political 
systems,

81
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:40,330
exclude economic systems,
exclude any hierarchy of value.

82
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:43,760
Excludes obviously because if there is a
hierarchy of value,

83
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:48,761
some things are more valuable than 
others and the less valuable things are 

84
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,260
excluded because otherwise it wouldn't 
be a hierarchy of value.

85
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,740
But the next claim they essentially make
is that the reason that those 

86
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,110
hierarchies of value are constructed 
isn't to produce whatever it is that's a

87
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:04,111
value,
but to exclude and to maintain the 

88
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:06,700
structure of power that's intrinsic to 
the hierarchy of value.

89
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,850
And that's a,
that's an unbelievably crooked claim 

90
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,761
because there are multiple reasons why a
hierarchy of value might be put into 

91
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:18,421
place there.
Hierarchies of beauty and there's 

92
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:20,551
hierarchies of competence,
hierarchies of intelligence and and 

93
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:23,470
attractiveness and,
and athletic ability and musical talent.

94
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:28,471
There's multiple hierarchies.
And in order for those things to exist 

95
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:29,680
at a high order,
in order for us to,

96
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,640
to,
to,

97
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,300
to laud,
what would you say?

98
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,460
Musical genius.
We have to excuse all the people.

99
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:41,461
We have to exclude all the people who 
can only squawk their clarinet from the 

100
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:44,230
hierarchy because otherwise you don't 
have any music and there's no option.

101
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:49,231
There's no direction.
And so to claim that the purpose of the 

102
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:53,251
hierarchy is to exclude is unbelievably 
crooked and it's central claim for both,

103
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,590
for both Fuko and and Dera.
That's one of those slights of hands 

104
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,591
that people don't quite notice,
but that have absolutely catastrophic 

105
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:02,591
effects.

106
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:05,720
Now for food co and Derrida,
you could,

107
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:08,090
here's how you could imagine their world
essentially.

108
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,880
Um,
you know,

109
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,720
for the,
for the philosopher Hobbes,

110
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,930
life was nasty,
brutish and short,

111
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:18,200
and people were at each other's throats 
in the state of nature,

112
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,230
right?
But Hobbs really thought about that as 

113
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,230
a,
as a,

114
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,480
as the chaos of individuals.
And he believed that a central authority

115
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:31,481
had to exert force in order to organize 
that intrinsic chaos so that some degree

116
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:36,551
of peace could rain.
It's kind of the opposite of John Shaw 

117
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:39,770
crusoe's theory,
which was that human beings were 

118
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,371
intrinsically good and,
and the state the government was 

119
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:45,851
intrinsically bad,
and that all of what made people evil 

120
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:46,180
derive from the state.
Um,

121
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,310
I would say if you put hobbes and 
Rousseau together,

122
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:53,030
you actually get the truth,
even though they do seem to be coming at

123
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:58,031
it from opposite perspectives because 
people are actually good and evil and 

124
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:59,690
social structures are also good and 
evil.

125
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,690
And you know,
it's paradoxical and we don't like 

126
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:04,940
paradoxical categories,
but that's still how it is.

127
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,310
What,
what Fuco and Derrida and the 

128
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,240
postmodernists did was that they kind of
added the collective element to that.

129
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:16,241
So there are hobbsy and world isn't a 
world of individuals struggling against 

130
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:18,320
one another in the initial state of war,
like nature.

131
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:23,321
It's,
it's groups of individuals bound by 

132
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:26,411
whatever their identity happens to be 
struggling against each other for power.

133
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,030
Because in the postmodern,
neo Marxist universe,

134
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:35,031
there's nothing but power.
And there's a variety of reasons for 

135
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:38,801
that.
Partly it's because the postmodernists 

136
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:41,240
don't admit that there are any standards
outside of arbitrary opinion,

137
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,390
essentially they don't really believe in
the real world,

138
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:47,060
which is why they can generate critiques
of science,

139
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:52,061
for example,
which is increasingly characterized is 

140
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:52,950
nothing but part of the euro centric 
patriarchies,

141
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,110
um,
what would you call desire to impose 

142
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,761
their power structure on the rest of the
world despite the fact that it also 

143
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:02,170
makes planes fly and computers operate 
and,

144
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,800
and well,
you know,

145
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,390
yeah,
exactly.

146
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,940
So,
and it's a rare bloody,

147
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,520
um,
social justice warrior that doesn't have

148
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,840
an iphone or a android,
that wouldn't work if quantum mechanics 

149
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,591
wasn't actually correct because the fact
that quantum mechanics is correct is one

150
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:25,601
of the reasons why these unbelievably 
highly developed pieces of technology 

151
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:29,741
actually functioned.
So they bitch and whine about the 

152
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:31,760
patriarchal,
patriarchal underpinnings of Eurocentric

153
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,670
Science and use the gadgets all the time
to aggregate,

154
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:38,870
to complain about it.
So it's really pretty appalling.

155
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:40,490
So anyways,
anyways,

156
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:45,491
the worldview of the,
of the postmodern neo marxists is that 

157
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,611
everybody is basically not an individual
because that's really a fiction.

158
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:51,500
And a eurocentric,
patriarchal fiction at that,

159
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:56,501
but a member of whatever their identity 
group happens to be and there's no real 

160
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:59,070
possibility of communication between 
identity groups,

161
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,980
hence phenomena like cultural 
appropriation.

162
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,840
And so it's a war of all groups against 
all groups and it's all,

163
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:11,130
it's nothing but a struggle for power 
and there is no higher order ethic to be

164
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,130
referred to because for the 
postmodernists,

165
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,770
um,
there is no such thing as a higher order

166
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:17,100
ethic.

167
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,140
There is no such thing as a uniting 
narrative.

168
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,510
That's,
that's a hallmark of their thinking.

169
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:22,140
Now,
of course,

170
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:27,141
that doesn't work out in practice 
because without an ethic or a higher 

171
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:30,621
order value,
there isn't anything you can do with 

172
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:30,621
your life because you keep undermining 
yourself.

173
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:32,790
If everything's just a whim and 
subjective,

174
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:37,791
there's.
And there's no hierarchy of values than 

175
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:37,791
what the hell do you do when you get up 
in the morning,

176
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,690
if one thing isn't better than the 
other,

177
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:44,691
you might as well just lay there and 
smother yourself with a pillow would be 

178
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:46,260
a lot easier than opening your eyes and 
struggling in the world.

179
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,710
So it's so it's completely,
it's a self defeating philosophy and I 

180
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,571
think that's part of the reason why it's
more or less self evident that it's a 

181
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:59,721
mask for the continuation of Marxism 
because at least Marxism has as one of 

182
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:01,530
its advantages at direction.

183
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,500
It's an ethic,
right?

184
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:07,501
Do you have something to struggle 
against even though what you're 

185
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,820
struggling against is certainly one of 
the things that you actually rely on and

186
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:13,821
second something that you have to 
oversimplify in a very ungrateful and 

187
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,920
resentful way to justify fighting 
against it to begin with.

188
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,330
And that's especially true in western 
cultures because as pathological as they

189
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:26,331
certainly are,
which is approximately as pathological 

190
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:29,061
as all of you are,
there are a lot less pathological than 

191
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,031
almost everything that's ever happened 
and pretty much everything that's 

192
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,180
currently happening elsewhere in the 
world.

193
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,360
And you can kind of tell that by the 
fact that people tend to come to 

194
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,000
immigrate to the West rather than the 
reverse.

195
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,020
Now,
you know,

196
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,690
the postmodern new Marxists would have 
an answer to that,

197
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:46,170
which would be the only reason the west 
functions is because it's raped the rest

198
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:48,480
of the,
of humanity and the planet.

199
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,440
But,
you know,

200
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,730
uh,
the less said about that,

201
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:54,210
the better.
