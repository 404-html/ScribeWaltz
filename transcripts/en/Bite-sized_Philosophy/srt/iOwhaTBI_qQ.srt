1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:00,490
Okay,

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,820
and why?
Behold is the moat that isn't my 

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,921
brother's eye,
but consider us not the beam that is in 

4
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:09,160
or how will you say to that?
My brother,

5
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:11,830
let me pull out the motive of the NIH 
and behold,

6
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:14,710
a beam is in nine Onei.
What you might be wondering,

7
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:18,360
what a beam is.
A moat is the dust speck

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,450
and a beam is a very large piece of 
lumber and so the issue is not so much 

9
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:32,071
the blindness of others even though 
there's as much blindness among others 

10
00:00:32,411 --> 00:00:37,411
as there is in as there is for you,
but the issue here,

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,440
the advice here,
the description here is you should be 

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,771
concerned about what's interfering with 
your own vision first and you should 

13
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:48,820
leave other people the hell alone in 
relationship to that,

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,230
and so if you're a mode of being in the 
world is if you would just act better,

15
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:58,231
things would improve for me.
Or if you identify the evil and the 

16
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:02,980
catastrophe is something that's outside 
that someone else needs to fix,

17
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:05,650
or that someone's responded someone 
else's responsible for,

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,920
then then you're not going to fix that 
and you're going to remain blind to the 

19
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:22,670
things that you're doing and not doing 
that make things not go well and so it's

20
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:24,770
just better to think,
all right,

21
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:29,771
I'm probably blind in many,
many ways and maybe there are some ways 

22
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:34,150
that I could rectify that because it's 
highly probable that you're blind and 

23
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,150
all sorts of ways.
I mean,

24
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,910
it's.
It's in fact it's virtually certain and 

25
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,350
so it's just more useful to think,

26
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,230
how is it that I'm wrong in this 
situation?

27
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,100
I'll tell you something that I learned 
to do when I was arguing with my wife,

28
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:52,101
which happened quite frequently.
Because when you actually communicate 

29
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:57,111
with people,
you find out that there's many things 

30
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:59,061
that you don't agree on and that's 
because you were actually different 

31
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:01,911
creatures.
And so if you're actually going to have 

32
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:04,641
a truthful conversation,
then you're going to find out that you 

33
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:07,551
don't see things the same way.
And then you can either pretend that 

34
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:11,301
that's not the case in gloss over it and
then ended up in a 30 year silent war or

35
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:17,451
you can or you can have the damn fight 
when you need to have it and see if you 

36
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:21,861
can straighten it out.
So now and then we'd get in a situation 

37
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:26,451
where we were at loggerheads,
we couldn't move and it would spiral up 

38
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:28,200
into hate speech,
let's say,

39
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,510
because yeah,
everyone laughs because they know they 

40
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,020
manifest plenty of hate speech towards 
those they love.

41
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,620
So one of the things we learned to do 
was when we hit an impasse was to 

42
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:44,160
separate and to go our own ways and to 
go sit and think,

43
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:45,090
okay,
look,

44
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,960
we're at this

45
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,100
unpleasant situation.
We can't figure out how to move forward.

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,430
I'd always think,
of course it's her fault.

47
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,290
Obviously it's her fault.
Least Ninety five percent.

48
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,620
But maybe there was something I did that
contributed like five percent to it.

49
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,190
And so I would sit and think and ask 
myself a question,

50
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,950
which was,
is there anything that I did in the last

51
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:16,870
six months that increase the probability
that this impasse would manifest itself?

52
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,080
And I'll tell you,
you have no idea how fast your mind will

53
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:25,081
generate an answer to a question like 
that because there's undoubtedly some 

54
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:29,191
idiotic thing that you did that you know
that you remember that increased the 

55
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:32,881
probability that you're going to have 
your hands around the throat of the 

56
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:35,911
person that you love.
And then you can go tell them that and 

57
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:38,110
then you can have a conversation,
especially if they do the same thing.

58
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:38,890
Say,
look,

59
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:43,891
you know,
here's how I'm an idiot in this 

60
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:43,900
situation.
Now there person says,

61
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:44,710
well,
yeah,

62
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,150
it's,
here's how I'm an idiot,

63
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:51,151
and then your two idiots,
and then maybe you can have a 

64
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:53,041
conversation.
So thou hypocrite first cast out the 

65
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:57,631
beam of light,
and then shalt thou see clearly to cast 

66
00:03:57,631 --> 00:04:01,330
out the mote of thy brother's eye.
That's pay hard to argue with that.
