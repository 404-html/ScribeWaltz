1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,820
I tell you the Zebra story,
you,

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,100
any of you know that story.
Okay,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,130
I'll tell you this story.
Tell it.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,160
Stop me if I've told it to you before.
This tells you everything you need to 

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,160
know about human beings.
So it's worth it.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,110
It's worth.
It's worth knowing.

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,380
Okay,
so zebras have stripes and people say,

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,790
well,
that's for camouflage,

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,090
and then you think about that for two 
seconds and you think that's a really 

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,080
stupid theory because lions are 
camouflaged and they're like golden,

11
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:27,450
like the grass and zebras are black and 
white,

12
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:30,710
so you can see a zebra five miles away.
It's like there's a zebra,

13
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:35,711
it's black and white.
So the whole camouflage thing that's 

14
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:35,970
just not working out so well as a 
hypothesis.

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,330
Okay.
So bylaw biologists go and they decided 

16
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,121
to take a look at some zebras and so 
they're looking at zebra at on the herd 

17
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:45,840
because there's no zebra,
right?

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Just like there's no fish.
There are schools of fish and there are 

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,690
herds of zebras.
There isn't a fish.

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,060
This is why I think the cod aren't 
coming back.

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,510
There are no cod.
There are massive hundred mile long 

22
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,920
schools of cod,
10 stories deep,

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,460
20 million years old.
You wipe out the school.

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,830
You don't just get to throw a quad in 
the water and say,

25
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:08,370
well,
you know,

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,510
off you go.
It's like,

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,980
well,
where's my city?

28
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,110
It's like launching you in the middle of
a field.

29
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,130
It's like,
well,

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,840
go out there and reproduced.
It's like,

31
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,160
no,
that's not gonna happen,

32
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:22,161
you know,
so without the school that there's no 

33
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:24,951
cod and you can't just introduce a whole
school of cod because you don't have a 

34
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:25,040
whole school of cod,
so you know,

35
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,160
maybe the cod are never coming back and 
zebras are the same thing there.

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,200
There's not a zebra,
there's zebras and so you're looking at 

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,491
the zebras trying to study as zebra and 
you look at the Zebra and you make some 

38
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:37,650
notes and you look up and you think,
oh Christ.

39
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,040
Which zebra was I looking at?
And the answer to that is you don't know

40
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,250
because the,
the camouflage is against the herd and 

41
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:46,910
the black and white stripes.
There's a variety of reasons for this.

42
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:50,070
Stripes flies also seem not to like the 
stripes,

43
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:51,480
but you know,
usually people,

44
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,120
things evolve for multiple reasons,
but anyways,

45
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:56,610
it's very difficult to parse out a zebra
against the herd.

46
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:57,510
You look down,
you look up,

47
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,380
it's like,
oh,

48
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,480
I'll hold those.
Damn zebras look the same.

49
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,460
Yes,
the camouflage is effective,

50
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:04,840
but it's against the herd.
All right,

51
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,820
so then you think,
well,

52
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:08,520
we better identify as zebra so we can 
see what he's up to.

53
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,820
So then you take your jeep and a can of 
red paint and a stick with a rag on the 

54
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,260
end of it and you drive up to the zebras
and you paint their haunch.

55
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:21,261
Read that a little bit,
put a nice red dot on their haunch or 

56
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:23,601
maybe clipped the rear with a cattle 
clip and then you stand back and you 

57
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:23,601
think,
Hey,

58
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:23,700
I'm pretty smart now.

59
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,700
I gotta watch that Zebra.
So what do you think happens to the 

60
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:28,890
Zebra?
The lions kill it,

61
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,680
right?
Right,

62
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,600
right.
Because lions,

63
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,860
they're smart,
right?

64
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:39,810
Hunter hunting animals are smart,
but they have to identify a zebra before

65
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:42,900
they can organize their hunt.
They can't just hunt the whole herd.

66
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,140
They have to pick out a zebra and so 
maybe it's like a zebra that's got a 

67
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,050
sore hip or something and so you think,
well,

68
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:51,000
nature's kind.
It just takes the week.

69
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:54,570
It's still no zebra or lions,
like really healthy,

70
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:59,571
delicious zebras,
but they look like all the other 

71
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:02,001
healthy,
delicious zebras so they can't get a 

72
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:04,171
beat on them.
But if there are small and just born or 

73
00:03:04,171 --> 00:03:04,900
if they're limping or there's something 
that identifies them,

74
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:08,470
then the lions can pick them out and 
then they do pick them out.

75
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,070
And so the rule for human beings is keep
your damn stripes on so the lions don't 

76
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:14,560
get you.

77
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,390
And I'm telling you,
man,

78
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,320
if you want to remember one thing from 
my class about human motivation,

79
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,610
that's a good thing to learn.
People camouflage themselves against the

80
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,250
herd and they like to be in the middle 
of the herd,

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,630
which is what fish do.
By the way,

82
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:30,820
if you have a big school of fish,
the smart,

83
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,880
healthy,
large fish are in the middle of the 

84
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,510
school because you know what you call a 
fish on the outside of the school bait,

85
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,410
right?
So that's what people are doing there 

86
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,860
are trying to move into the middle of 
the herd all the time and the herd moves

87
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,870
around or the school moves around and 
people are going,

88
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:47,650
well,
I'm in the middle,

89
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:52,651
I'm staying in the middle here,
so I've got this protective ring of 

90
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:55,270
people around me so the predators don't 
pick me out and do me in.

91
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,320
So okay,
so that's part of the reason why I said,

92
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:04,321
well,
you can't sell something to someone for 

93
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:04,321
success because you're thinking,
well,

94
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:05,560
people are aiming at success.
Don't,

95
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:10,561
don't be thinking that.
It's not by any means necessarily true 

96
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:12,970
trait.
Neuroticism is a potential most powerful

97
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:17,971
motivator and trait.
Neuroticism is let's not be too 

98
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:17,971
threatened or hurt,
right?

99
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:22,711
That's the negative emotion system.
And the negative emotion system is a 

100
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:23,190
killer source of motivation.
You know,

101
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,310
you also see that there are scales of 
wellbeing that have been designed mostly

102
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:30,160
by social psychologists,
which means they're very bad scales most

103
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:34,120
of the time because their psychometric 
capacity is is is absurdly low,

104
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:39,121
generally speaking.
So what you find with scales of 

105
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:42,061
wellbeing sometimes they're talked about
as scales of happiness even is that 

106
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:43,050
people aren't after happiness 
thereafter,

107
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,060
not hurting.
It's not so they don't want to be 

108
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,271
extroverted and enthusiastic,
right and and bubbly and full of smiles 

109
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:51,520
and laughter.

110
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,740
That isn't what they mean by I want to 
be happy.

111
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,500
What they mean is I don't want to be 
anxious or in pain,

112
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,430
and so wellbeing scales tend to be 
something like neuroticism,

113
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,610
sorry,
emotional stability plus extroversion,

114
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,920
but the big loading is on emotional 
stability.

115
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:11,410
The reverse of neuroticism.
You want to avoid suffering.

116
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,570
You don't want to be happy.
You want to avoid suffering,

117
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,590
and one way to avoid suffering is not to
let the Lions Gnaw on you.

118
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,800
And one way of doing that is to stay in 
the middle of the damn hurt.

119
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,890
And so like,
I'm not being a smart Alec about this.

120
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:27,190
I understand why people do that.
There's real danger to being visible.

121
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:29,290
There's real danger in being visible.
Now.

122
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,060
You might be successful if you're 
visible,

123
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:32,410
but you also might be dead.
