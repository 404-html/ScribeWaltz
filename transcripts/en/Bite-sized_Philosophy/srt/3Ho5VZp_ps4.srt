00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,740
Afraid of the answers to these 
questions,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:07,210
um,
can left and right wing people ever 

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,220
meaningfully communicate with each 
other.

4
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:10,620
And I'm wondering if you can comment a 
little about temporary mentality and the

5
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:11,460
differences there in

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,350
that's what they do in a democracy.
Look,

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,380
the lefties,
they're high in openness and low in 

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,970
conscientiousness and that means they 
don't like responsibility that much,

9
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:27,971
but they're pretty damn creative and 
they're not very orderly especially 

10
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:29,270
they're not very orderly and that's part
of conscientiousness by the way.

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,690
And so they're good at being artists and
they're good at being entrepreneurs,

12
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:37,691
but they're terrible at running things.
But then the conservatives on the other 

13
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:37,691
side,
they are low in openness,

14
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:42,641
which is the treat creativity.
That doesn't mean they're stupid by the 

15
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:42,641
way.
It just means they're,

16
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:42,920
they're,
they're,

17
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,220
they're thinking isn't as free form,
let's put it that way.

18
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:48,800
And so it's more constrained and they're
high in conscientiousness,

19
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:53,801
especially orderliness.
So they're damn good at running things 

20
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:55,280
that already work.
So you need the liberals.

21
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,340
There wouldn't be high openness,
low conscientiousness if there wasn't a 

22
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:00,340
niche for it.

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,690
And you need the conservatives,
and sometimes the liberals are right,

24
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,600
the borders should be more open because 
that's their fundamental claim,

25
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:07,130
and sometimes the conservatives are 
right,

26
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:12,131
the borders between things should be 
more closed and because they're both 

27
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:16,421
right some of the time,
and because the environment keeps 

28
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:19,091
snaking around,
you have to have dialogue between the 

29
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:22,271
two sources constantly,
constantly so that the the polity can 

30
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:24,350
orient itself as the snake of the 
environment moves,

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,560
and that's why you need free speech.
And so the left and the right get along 

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:29,990
perfectly well together as long as they 
can talk to each other,

33
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:32,000
but as soon as they can't talk to each 
other,

34
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:37,001
then the alternative,
there's only one altar to alternatives 

35
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:38,300
to negotiation.
Simple as that.

36
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,790
One is slavery.
The other is tyranny.

37
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,300
So if those you cannot negotiate with 
will either become your slaves or your 

38
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,780
tyrants,
so you wipe outs free speech,

39
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,960
then that's what you're left with and 
that's why free speech isn't just 

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:52,960
another right,
for Christ's sake.

41
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,320
It's not just another.
Right?

42
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,440
How dumb can you be to think that you 
don't know anything if you think that 

43
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,000
it's the mechanism by which people have 
different opinions talk instead of 

44
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:08,490
strangling each other.
So and,

45
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:13,510
uh,
but if you want them to strangle each 

46
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,510
other,
which you might then really,

47
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,370
you might then take away the right to 
express their opinion and watched the 

48
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,331
whole thing go up in flames and go like 
this because maybe that's what a big 

49
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:22,790
part of you want.
