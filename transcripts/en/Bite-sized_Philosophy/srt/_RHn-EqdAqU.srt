1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
Well,
I can tell,

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,910
I can tell you these attempts to shut 
people down or being made because you 

3
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:15,351
need to know this,
so as far as I've been able to 

4
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:20,541
determine,
this kind of protest is an expression of

5
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:24,390
a philosophy that's grounded partly in 
postmodernism,

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,900
partly in Marxism.
The postmodern element is basically 

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,431
this.
There is no such genuine individual 

8
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:38,691
identity group identity and you liked it
or not only have the interests of your 

9
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:45,111
group and the whole world is nothing but
a battle ground between groups of 

10
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,310
different interests.
There's no dialogue,

11
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,430
there's no possibility of parking 
between the groups.

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,720
It's just a power stage where combat has
to take place and so the reason that 

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,970
speakers with whom the radical 
postmodernists tend the is to degree or 

14
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,921
denied a passport because those people 
do not believe from the philosophical 

15
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:11,010
position.
The dialogue can bring consensus and all

16
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:14,480
that's left if you forgo that particular
principle is,

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,860
and this is only where it starts,
you know the fuck is that,

18
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,490
that you're all pretty damn civilized 
and thank God for that.

19
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,890
Because if there were enough fools in 
the crowd,

20
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,920
especially those who are intent on 
violence,

21
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,840
this would turn out very differently.
We do not want to go down that pathway.

22
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,830
It's a big mistake.
We've been down that pathway many,

23
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:38,760
many times.

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,040
I would certainly not conforming to a 
consensus that was against my belief 

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,020
merely because it was a consensus in the
group is wrong.

26
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,970
The question was,
if there was a consensus against my 

27
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,820
beliefs,
what are your goals with them?

28
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,570
And answer would be,
well,

29
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:02,120
first it would depend on what my 
conscience said.

30
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,990
What are we going to do?
Assume that the consensus is correct.

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,560
The Nazis had a consensus,
right?

32
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:14,790
The end of it.
Joel has a conscience and you have to 

33
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,671
know when the group is made a mistake.
In which case what's the maximum?

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,700
Talked a lot in your personality closet,
very confronting your shadow and 

35
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,410
generating your shadow.
Um,

36
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,460
do you find that people who care less 
about what other people think and care 

37
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,731
more about their conscience have 
integrated their shadow maybe more than 

38
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:50,850
people who care more about others?

39
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,810
Can you hear me at all?
You got a question,

40
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,750
the question was stabbing from my 
personality class are willing to abide 

41
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:13,051
by.
There are those who've been to braided 

42
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:15,950
their shadow and I would say yes,
because you have to be a bit of a 

43
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,460
monster to stand up to the crowd,
right?

44
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:23,440
If you're too concerned with people like
you and if you're to avoid conflict,

45
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:28,710
then you're going to cave to pressure 
and you don't want to do that because if

46
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:32,020
you let people stop you from moving 
forward,

47
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,410
you just end up being something and if 
you're someone who's got no life in you 

48
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,950
and that's no good for you have to get 
tough,

49
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,070
but you have to give tough in a way 
that's controlled,

50
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,420
right?
It has to be controlled because 

51
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,771
otherwise you're the puppet of your 
worst impulses and that's a terrible 

52
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:53,080
thing to be.
