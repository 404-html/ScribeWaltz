1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,570
People who are cynical about religious 
structures like to think of faith as the

2
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:11,331
willingness to demolish your intellect 
in the service of superstition and you 

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,320
know,
there's,

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,390
there's something to be said for that 
perspective,

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,580
but not a lot because the reality is 
much more sophisticated.

6
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:25,581
Part of the faith that's,
that is being insisted upon in the old 

7
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:30,441
testament is something like,
and I'm speaking psychologically here 

8
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:32,030
again,
that it's useful.

9
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,300
Deposit A.
Hi.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,020
Hi.
Good to aim at it.

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,290
So,
and I,

12
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:41,291
I really think that's practically useful
to the research we've done with the 

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:41,310
future authoring program,
for example,

14
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:46,311
indicates pretty clearly that if you get
people to conceptualize an ideal and a 

15
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:46,920
unbalanced ideal,
you know,

16
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:50,130
so what do you want for your family?
What do you want for your career?

17
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:55,131
What do you want for your education?
What do you want for your character 

18
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:57,921
development?
How are you going to use your time 

19
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:57,921
outside of work?

20
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,940
How are you going to structure your use 
of drugs and alcohol and places where 

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,351
you might get impulsive?
How can you avoid falling into a 

22
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:06,720
horrible path?
If you really think that through and you

23
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:08,510
come up with an integrated ideal and 
you,

24
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,220
you put it above us,
something to reach for,

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,580
then you're more committed to the world 
in a positive way and you're less 

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,160
tormented by anxiety and uncertainty and
so and that makes sense,

27
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:28,161
right?
Because here you are alive and 

28
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:29,160
everything,
and so unless you were Cape,

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,210
if you're not capable of manifesting 
some positive relationship with the fact

30
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:38,211
of your being,
then how could that be anything other 

31
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:41,181
than hellish because it would just be 
anxiety provoking and terrible because 

32
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:43,950
you're vulnerable and there'd be nothing
useful or worthwhile to do.

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,660
Well,
that's just not.

34
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,600
I just can't see that as a winning 
strategy for anyone.

35
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,810
You can make a rational case for 
adopting that strategy in that,

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,050
you know,
you can say,

37
00:01:55,051 --> 00:02:00,051
well,
there's no evidence for for a 

38
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:00,051
transcendent morality or for an ultimate
meaning.

39
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:04,371
There's no hard empirical evidence,
but it seems to me that there's 

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,500
existential evidence as well that has to
be taken into account and of course like

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,490
psychologists have talked about this a 
lot.

42
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,980
I'm Carl Rogers,
for example,

43
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:16,050
in [inaudible] for that matter.
Freud for that matter,

44
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:18,980
most of the great psychologists have 
pointed out that you know,

45
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,150
you can derive reasonable information 
that's solid from your own experience,

46
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:29,301
especially if you also talk to other 
people and you can kind of see in your 

47
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:32,631
own life when you're on a productive 
path that sort of ennobles and 

48
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:37,040
enlightens you or a destructive path.
And I think it's kind of useful to think

49
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,760
that maybe the dichotomy between those 
two paths might be real,

50
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,450
you know,
and,

51
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:48,451
and because that also allows you to give
credence to your intuitions about that 

52
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:49,800
sort of thing.

53
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,120
But I don't anyways,
I don't think it's unreasonable to pause

54
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:54,420
it.
That since you're alive,

55
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,140
adopting the highest possible regard for
the fact that you're alive and you're 

56
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:02,500
surrounded by other creatures that are 
alive.

57
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,340
I just can't see how that can possibly 
be construed as a losing strategy.

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,490
And so that's the first.
So that's something like faith,

59
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,270
right?
It's faith,

60
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,940
it's not,
it's not only faith in your being,

61
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:16,120
but it's faith in being as such.
And the faith would be something like,

62
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,600
if you could orient your being properly,
then maybe that would orient you with 

63
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:24,970
being as such.
And you never know.

64
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,680
Like,
I mean it might be true.

65
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,940
There's no reason to assume that it 
wouldn't be true.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I mean,
even if you just take a strict 

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,471
biological perspective on this and think
about us as the product of three and a 

68
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:38,050
half billion years of evolution.

69
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:43,050
I mean we have struggled over all those 
billions of years to be alive and to 

70
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:48,631
match ourselves with reality.
And so because one of the things I've 

71
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:49,300
often wondered is,
you know,

72
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,180
life is definitely difficult.
There's no doubt about that.

73
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:57,181
And it's unfair and there's inequality 
and all of those things and people are 

74
00:03:57,181 --> 00:04:00,301
subject to all sorts of terrible things.
But I also wonder if you weren't 

75
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:05,791
actively striving to make things worse,
just how much better could they be?

76
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,090
You know,
because people are very,

77
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,050
they're like houses that are divided 
amongst themselves.

78
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,020
They're pointing in six different 
directions at the same time.

79
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,590
They're working at cross purposes to 
themselves because of bitterness and 

80
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,461
resentment and an what unprocessed 
memories and childhood hatreds and 

81
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,980
unexamined assumptions,
all sorts of things,

82
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:34,981
and you,
you just gotta wonder if you could push 

83
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:38,431
that aside and orient yourself properly.
And then the other thing that of course 

84
00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:42,451
is stressed very heavily in the old 
testament and of course that goes 

85
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:46,681
through the entire biblical corpus is 
that it's not only enough to establish a

86
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:50,800
positive relationship with being,
which I think is the essential.

87
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,030
It's a good description of faith.
You have to make that decision,

88
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:58,030
right?
Because being is very ambivalent and you

89
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:03,031
can make the case that maybe it's 
something that should have never 

90
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:05,941
happened,
but that doesn't seem to be productive 

91
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:05,941
to me.
And faith seems to be.

92
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:10,591
I'm going to act as if being is 
ultimately justifiable and that if I 

93
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:15,421
partake in it properly,
I will improve it rather than making it 

94
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:18,721
worse.
So I think that's the statement of 

95
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:21,331
faith.
And then what seems to go along with 

96
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:23,290
that is something like truth in 
conception,

97
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,790
inaction.
You know,

98
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,500
even people like Jacob who are pretty 
damn morally ambivalent to begin with,

99
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,940
get hammered a lot by what they go 
through and what seems to happen is that

100
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:36,370
they're hammered into some sort of 
ethical shape,

101
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,400
right?
So by the mid point of their life's 

102
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,070
journey,
there are people who are solidly planted

103
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,370
who you can trust and who don't betray 
being or themselves or their fellow 

104
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:48,250
Matt.

105
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,460
And so it's an interesting.
I mean it seems reasonable to me to 

106
00:05:55,541 --> 00:06:00,541
first assume that you have establish a 
relationship with something that's 

107
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,420
transcendent.
It might even be just the future version

108
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:07,421
of you and then second that you have to 
align yourself with reality in a 

109
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:13,181
truthful manner and that that's your 
best bet and the biblical stories at 

110
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:21,491
Roxbury.
Quite realistic about that too because 

111
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:21,491
they don't really say that if you do 
that,

112
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:24,320
you're going to be instantly transported
to the promised land.

113
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,350
Like even Moses,
as we'll find out in the accident 

114
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,350
stories,
he never makes it to the promised land.

115
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,740
And so it's not like you're offered 
instantaneous,

116
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:38,741
final redemption.
If you move out forthrightly into the 

117
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:42,101
world,
establish a faithful relationship with 

118
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,810
being an attempt to conduct yourself 
with integrity,

119
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,290
but it's your best bet and it might be 
good enough,

120
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,620
and even if it's not good enough,
it's really preferable to the 

121
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,760
alternative,
which seems to be something closely akin

122
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:57,710
to hail,
both personal and social.
