1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,990
How much trouble would you want there 
not to be?

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,180
It's a weird question,
right?

3
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:08,430
Because you want to have something to 
contend with.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,780
You want to have something that that 
forces from you the best that you have,

5
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:15,360
and so you have to have real problems.
Something like that.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,480
Would you dispense with all your real.
You could just lay down on a bed and 

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,931
have pablum infused into your mouth.
You know if all your problems were 

8
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:27,660
solved and so maybe you want difficult 
problems that you can solve.

9
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,400
Something like that because there's 
some.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,170
I don't know what it is about it.
There's A.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,260
There's the overcoming and the and the 
growth that comes along with that.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,720
There's something about the nobility of 
the enterprise.

13
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:38,760
You certainly see that when you go about
having children,

14
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:39,600
for example,
which is,

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,860
you know,
the psychological literature is quite 

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,541
clear if,
if you do moment to moment comparisons 

17
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:47,541
of people who have kids and people who 
don't have kids,

18
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:52,140
the people who don't have kids are 
happier and so psychologists who tend to

19
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:57,141
get things wrong,
even when they make intelligent 

20
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,300
discoveries like that one,
immediately some of them jumped to the 

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,020
conclusion that because happiness is the
goal,

22
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:06,021
that while there's something about 
children that make you unhappy and 

23
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:06,021
that's not good,
it's like,

24
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:06,810
well,
wait a second,

25
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,790
and maybe that's the wrong metric.

26
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,790
It's like,
of course you're less happy once you 

27
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:13,790
have children because you have to worry 
about them.

28
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,590
You know,
my neighbor down the street who's very 

29
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,841
smart woman said to me once,
you can only be as happy as your 

30
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:22,260
unhappiest child,
which I thought was really good.

31
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:23,490
You know,
that's really smart,

32
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,140
but then it isn't.
Well,

33
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:26,850
it's having children doesn't make you 
happy.

34
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:28,470
The answer isn't,
don't have children.

35
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,720
It's like,
don't be so stupid about being happy.

36
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:35,721
That's the answer.
It's because there's a nobility in the 

37
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:35,721
pursuit,
right?

38
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,410
And of course now you're responsible,
you know you have a new baby.

39
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:39,180
You think especially if you're a new 
parent,

40
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:44,181
you think,
what the hell is this and what am I 

41
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:44,760
gonna do with it?
You know,

42
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:46,330
it's like,
and then you're,

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,500
you're done for the rest of your life.
You never sleep properly again because 

44
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,551
you're going to be worried about this 
creature that you have to take care of 

45
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:55,551
it,
but like,

46
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:55,590
what the hell good are you?

47
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,640
If you're not doing that or something 
else equally difficult because you just,

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,650
you just have been called out yet.
Unless you take on a responsibility like

49
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:09,651
that,
the idea that life is that happiness is 

50
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:10,260
the purpose of life.
It's like great for happiness,

51
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:11,340
man.
If it comes along,

52
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,280
you should be thrilled that it's 
visiting you,

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,610
but the notion that that's,
that that's what you should pursue.

54
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:20,520
That's,
that's the weakest possible notion.

55
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,980
First of all,
as soon as something terrible happens to

56
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:23,850
you,
you're done.

57
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,800
It's like life is to be happy.
It's like,

58
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:27,180
well,
now you have cancer,

59
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,700
so how's that?
How's the happiness thing?

60
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:34,230
Work it out for you now,
or maybe it's not you.

61
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:39,231
You know,
maybe it's your father that has 

62
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:40,971
Alzheimer's disease or some damn thing 
and you know it's like it's a rare 

63
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:41,730
person that doesn't have some 
catastrophe.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,490
One,
one person away from them.

65
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,520
It's like life is to be happy.
It's that's not right,

66
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,370
and we can at least derive that from 
these stories.

67
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:55,371
That isn't what they say at all.
God's perfectly happy in the stories to 

68
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:58,290
grant the people with whom he forms a 
covenant happiness and prosperity,

69
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,670
but there's never a word that that's the
purpose.

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,510
The rule is aim high and get your bloody
act together.

71
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,570
That's the rule and establish this 
contractual covenant with the ultimate 

72
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,811
ideal and that will see you through the 
catastrophes and that's a much more 

73
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:15,610
mature way of looking at life as far as 
I'm concerned because all you have to do

74
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:20,611
is have your eyes half open and you see 
that the fundamental reality of life is 

75
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:23,260
tragedy and suffering.
There's that's inescapable.

76
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,240
The quest.
That doesn't mean that it.

77
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,450
It makes life unbearable or that it 
makes being something that shouldn't 

78
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,720
have existed,
right?

79
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,720
That isn't what it means,
but it means that you have to contend 

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,781
with it and you have to get ready and 
the willingness to adopt responsibility 

81
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:42,250
for yourself and for others is,
is the precondition for that.

82
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:47,251
And then maybe if you do that properly,
then now and then you get some 

83
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:47,251
happiness.
You know,

84
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:51,331
you can sit at the end of the day and 
you have half an hour where your 

85
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,211
conscience is clear and there's nothing 
that you need to be doing and you can 

86
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:54,211
relax and think,
you know,

87
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:57,340
that that's all right.
Things are okay and thank God for that.

88
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,640
And that's,
that's maybe where you get your 

89
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,450
happiness.
So that's something that's growing up,

90
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,470
man,
obviously,

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,760
and,
and to not know that and to not be 

92
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:10,760
taught that,
like everyone should be taught that it's

93
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,650
so obvious.
