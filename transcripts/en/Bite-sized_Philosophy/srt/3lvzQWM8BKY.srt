1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,930
Obsessive compulsive disorder,
so chronic handwashing for example,

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:08,640
is this is as an anxiety disorder,
but there is an anxiety component to it,

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,980
but I don't believe that that's an 
accurate classification.

4
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:15,981
I think that obsessive compulsive 
disorder is actually a disorder of 

5
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:18,801
disgust because all of the behaviors,
including hyper grooming people 

6
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:22,941
sometimes have trichotillomania.
They'll pull out the hairs on their 

7
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:26,181
body.
The grooming behaviors and that sort of 

8
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:28,281
thing seemed to be more associated with 
the operation of the disgust system and 

9
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:31,971
almost everything about obsessive 
compulsive disorder has a disgust basis.

10
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:37,071
And so one of the things that people who
are who have ocd obsessive about is that

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,750
I've got a client once who was this poor
woman.

12
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:44,751
By the time her ocd was done with her.
She built the equivalent of an airlock 

13
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:49,101
on her house.
Like not technically proficient or 

14
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:51,411
anything like that.
And her husband and her children had to 

15
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:52,230
go through an elaborate decontamination 
process before they were allowed to step

16
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:52,920
foot in the house.

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,160
And one of the things she was very 
concerned about was that she would go 

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,770
out to a supermarket and touch a piece 
of fruit.

19
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,870
And,
and become contaminated and then come 

20
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,991
home and touch her children and then 
they would become contaminated and so 

21
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:09,590
while she ended up in the hospital and 
she was divorced and I just did it in 

22
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,700
her life,
you know,

23
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,450
and so then people who have obsessive 
compulsive disorder,

24
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:12,960
you know,
they'll,

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,630
they'll wash their hands until the soap 
is gone,

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,130
like a whole bar of soap.
Right.

27
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:22,131
And you can often tell who they are 
because their hands are shiny from 

28
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:23,310
Washington much and they'll shower,
it can't get out of the shower,

29
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:26,330
they'll shower until the hot water is 
completely gone and you know,

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,430
so the self cleaning mechanism so to 
speak,

31
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:34,431
have gone seriously astray and the way 
you treat them as by exposing them to 

32
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:35,940
things that are disgusting and 
contaminating.

33
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,900
I had a client with ocd once,
he was quite the character and I.

34
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,140
One of the things I had him do was we 
would look for things on the Internet,

35
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:47,850
pictures of things that really disgusted
him.

36
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,570
It's not that much fun by the way,
treating someone who has ocd because I'm

37
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:55,020
rather disgust sensitive.
And so that was also rather hard on me,

38
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:57,420
so anyways,
we would look for things on the Internet

39
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:58,860
that,
that he really didn't like.

40
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:01,530
And then I'd print them out and have him
put him on his fridge,

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,740
which he did not like at all.
And he would,

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,920
he would,
he had a bunch of other problems and we 

43
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,931
got along quite well.
But for a long time I treated him for 

44
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,901
about three years.
He would phone me like three or four 

45
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,650
times a day because he had obsessive 
compulsive disorder and just swear at me

46
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:17,660
like mad,
you know,

47
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,770
just swear it,
it,

48
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,770
get these messages.

49
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:20,460
He'd,
he,

50
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,490
he phoned me and he was just so mad at 
me because I'd have to put these things 

51
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:25,490
on his fridge,
you know?

52
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,690
And so he'd curse and swear and yell at 
me.

53
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,810
And then two minutes later he would 
phone and apologize and say he was 

54
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:32,810
really sorry and helped.
I would continue to see them.

55
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,040
And God,
that just went.

56
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,440
I just went on forever.
But I felt sorry for the poor guy.

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,290
You know,
he eventually ended up getting a puppy.

58
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,960
You agreeable people.
Oh,

59
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,640
puppy God,
God,

60
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:47,590
unbelievable.
A.

61
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,440
Yeah.
Anyways,

62
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,460
that was good for him because he had to 
go around and clean up after the PA,

63
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:54,090
PA,
but that had poor puppy.

64
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:58,860
It was quite dominant and had all the 
things that happened to that poor guy so

65
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:03,100
the puppy would dominate him,
so he'd take it outside to take it for a

66
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,320
walk and he wasn't a very skilled person
in many,

67
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:05,920
many ways.

68
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,420
He had a very large number of severe 
impediments and so,

69
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,450
but he really liked this pop.
He didn't have any friends or anything 

70
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,890
like that and he was supported by his 
aged mother and God.

71
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,900
It was just a catastrophe and he'd go 
outside and try to walk the puppy and 

72
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:23,410
the puppy would just sit down,
right,

73
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:28,411
because it was doing dominant stuff and 
he didn't know how to overcome it and 

74
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:31,740
then these crazy people from across the 
way who styled themselves as animal 

75
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,611
rights activists started to harass me 
and they phoned up his mother and told 

76
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:35,611
them that if they,
if,

77
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:37,690
if she didn't take the dog away from 
that retard,

78
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:42,691
they were going to come over and do 
terrible things to him and then he got 

79
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:46,141
harassed on the street and then he went 
to a park with his dog and they came up 

80
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:49,060
to him and pushed him on the card and 
swiped his dog and ran off to the,

81
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,420
to the SPCA and dumped it there and he 
had to move away from his apartment and 

82
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,360
God,
it was just,

83
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,370
it was just an absolute catastrophe.

84
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,770
They had plenty of sympathy for that 
damn dog,

85
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:02,020
but no sympathy whatsoever for the guy,
you know.

86
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,000
It was really,
it was really something.

87
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,040
Anyways,
that story ended happily.

88
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,860
Weirdly enough.
He got a.

89
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,890
He got a job with a woman who used to be
a psychiatric nurse who was training 

90
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,480
dogs and she gave him a little job 
setting up the dog training thing and 

91
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,371
then he got to learn to train his dog.
He lost like he was a thin guy to begin 

92
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:26,851
with.
He lost like 30 pounds trying to learn 

93
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:26,851
how to take care of this puppy.
It was just.

94
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:28,390
I thought he was gonna die,
but there is no way he was going to give

95
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:30,820
up that dog.
And so anyways,

96
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,380
OCD,
it's quite the bloody catastrophe.

97
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,530
So.
And it's a good thing for someone who 

98
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:40,530
has ocd to have a dog,
right?

99
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,030
Because dogs are messy and so there's 
all sorts of things that are messy about

100
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:48,031
them,
but you have to kind of live with the 

101
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:48,031
mess.
Like you have to live with the mass.

102
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:51,301
If you're going to have a child or if 
you're going to have a partner of any 

103
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:51,301
sort,
you know,

104
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:54,701
you,
you can't let the orderliness part of 

105
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,650
you get the upper hand so terribly that 
it's impossible for you to lift.
