1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
Okay,
so the question is can that sense of 

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,060
meaning behind jacked and the answer to 
that is absolutely,

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,370
absolutely,
because you could say that the ultimate 

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,140
sense of meaning is composed of the 
Union of fragmentary senses,

5
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:16,470
of meaning and the fragmentary sensitive
meaning can be overwhelmingly powerful,

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,400
anger,
sexual lust and and,

7
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:24,401
and the sorts of things that you 
experienced wouldn't say when you're 

8
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:25,710
playing a video game which are very 
carefully calibrated to keep you on the,

9
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:30,711
on the edge of exploration.
Let's say now I'm not a full of video 

10
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:35,421
games because games are complicated and 
it isn't clear what people are doing 

11
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:35,790
when they're playing them,
you know,

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,250
they may be expanding their cognitive 
skills,

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,310
they may be learning to cooperate,
they may be learning to engage in 

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,101
complex problem solving and so,
but part of it's also a matter of 

15
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:46,950
balance,
you know,

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,250
50 hours a week,
probably not,

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,160
unless you're going to go pro,
right?

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,040
Because there's other things you need to
be attending to.

19
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:59,760
It's not a stable solution for you,
your family,

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,670
your society.
It's too one sided.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,670
Yeah,
and you can get pulled down rabbit holes

22
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:09,120
of all sorts that are one sided pursuits
of meaning,

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,510
so it's something we're actually going 
to talk about as the later classes 

24
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,470
unfold.
The question is how do you stop yourself

25
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:21,471
from falling prey to a pathologist sense
of meaning and I think one of the 

26
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:25,641
answers to that is don't lie because 
what you're hoping is that your nervous 

27
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:30,831
system is sufficiently healthy and well 
program so that what it reads out to you

28
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:36,321
is reliable and if you pathologize your 
psyche by either through sins of 

29
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:42,060
omission,
let's say or or outright deception,

30
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,910
you're going warp that internal 
structure and it's not going to read out

31
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:48,120
properly to you and then your sense of 
meaning will lead you astray.

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,410
So like one of the reasons for speaking 
the truth,

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,810
I shouldn't say that because you don't 
know how to speak the truth,

34
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:58,830
but you do know how not to lie and it's 
a game.

35
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:01,140
You're playing with yourself.
You can define the damn lies.

36
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:03,160
No one else has to do that for you.
You,

37
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,210
you,
you try not to utter falsehoods because 

38
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,480
you wore your neurological structure by 
doing so,

39
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:13,530
and then it will read out pathologically
and then if you rely on it to guide you,

40
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:18,531
it will run you right off a cliff.
So that's where there's a moral element 

41
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:20,580
to this is if you're going to rely on 
your sense of meaning,

42
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,120
make sure that you don't pollute the 
mechanism.

43
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,010
See,
this is.

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,290
This is partly why people go to 
confession,

45
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,180
right?
Which is,

46
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,120
which is a psychotherapeutic technique.
It's like,

47
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,270
okay,
what stupid miserable wretched things 

48
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:38,270
did I do this week?

49
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:38,440
Oh,
that's a good thing to,

50
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,110
to make conscious,
right?

51
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:43,200
Because maybe you cannot do them the 
next week and you think,

52
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:44,370
well,
why would you bother?

53
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,030
It's like,
well,

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,580
you're in a ship sailing across the 
stormy seas.

55
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,750
If,
if you're,

56
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,480
if you're hacking holes in it with a 
pickaxe,

57
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,090
you should probably pay attention to 
that before you sink,

58
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,970
so it's a good idea to keep,
to keep what you're doing.

59
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,460
That's stupid in mind so that you can 
stop doing it,

60
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,420
and so then you can more and more rely 
on yourself and your and your own.

61
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,350
Your own conscience,
let's say,

62
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:16,351
as a guide to proper action.
You know in the Pinocchio story is that 

63
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:17,920
the conscience was not an unerring guide
for Pinocchio.

64
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,310
It had to learn and so and so.
It's also partly pushing yourself into 

65
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:29,251
new situations and differentiating 
yourself so that you get wiser and so 

66
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:32,280
it's courage as well as truth.
That was,

67
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,380
those might be the two.
There's more beauty,

68
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,280
courage,
truth,

69
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:39,010
you know,
the fundamental virtues.

70
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,610
Why be virtuous?
That's the question,

71
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,960
and so that you can bear the suffering 
of life without becoming corrupt,

72
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,860
right?
It's practical.

73
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,700
It's practical.
If there's nothing more practical than 

74
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,610
that,
so unless you want misery and people do,

75
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,520
you know it's exciting.
Misery.

76
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,250
So other questions?

77
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,910
All right,
then.

78
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,610
See you next Wednesday.
