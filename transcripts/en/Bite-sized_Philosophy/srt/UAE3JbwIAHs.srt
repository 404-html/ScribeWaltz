1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,000
Thing,
the other thing about marriage,

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:07,001
this is really worth knowing too,
is that I learned this in part from 

3
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:10,331
reading youngest,
like what do you do when you get 

4
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:10,331
married?
That's easy.

5
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:12,200
You take someone who's just as useless 
and horrible as you are,

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,090
and then you shackle yourself to them 
and then you say,

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,440
we're not running away no matter what 
happens.

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,860
Yeah.
Well that's perfect because then you 

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,950
don't get to run away and the thing is 
is like if you can run away,

10
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:32,951
you can't tell each other the truth 
because if you tell someone the truth 

11
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:36,371
about you and they don't run away,
they weren't listening and so if you 

12
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:36,920
don't have someone around that can't run
away,

13
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:40,100
then you can't tell them the truth,
and so that's part of the purpose of the

14
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:40,820
marriage.
It's like,

15
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:41,540
okay,
okay,

16
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,580
I'll bet on you.
You bet on me.

17
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:45,140
It's a losing bet.
We both know that,

18
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:49,070
but given our current circumstances,
we're unlikely to find anyone better.

19
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:49,880
For sure.

20
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,890
Two things that come off of that.
One is you know,

21
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,870
people are waiting around to find Mr and
Mrs.

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,770
Right?
It's like,

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,120
here's something to think about,
man,

24
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:03,530
to put yourself on your feet,
right?

25
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,620
If you went to a party and you found Mr 
Wright and he looked at you and didn't 

26
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,011
run away screaming,
that would indicate that he wasn't Mr 

27
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:12,011
Wright at all.
Right?

28
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:15,740
It's like the old Nietzschean joke.
If someone loves you,

29
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:17,630
that should immediately disenchanted 
with them.

30
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,320
Right?
Right.

31
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:25,350
Or it's the woody Allen joke.
I never belonged to a club that would 

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,450
take me as a member.
So,

33
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,050
so that's,
uh,

34
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,580
that's an interesting.
That's a very interesting thing to think

35
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:33,581
about.
And so you're going to shackle yourself 

36
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:35,300
to someone who's just as far as 
imperfect as you are.

37
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,900
And then the issue is you,
you,

38
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,160
you might be in a situation where you 
can actually negotiate because you might

39
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:44,000
think,
well,

40
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:45,910
there's some things about you that 
aren't going so right.

41
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,250
And there's some things about me that 
aren't going so right and we're bloody 

42
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:51,680
well stuck with the consequences for the
next 50 years.

43
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,070
So we can,
we can either straighten this out or we 

44
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,590
can suffer through it for the next five 
decades.

45
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,440
And you know,
people are of the sort that without that

46
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:03,440
degree of seriousness,
those problems will not be solved.

47
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,040
You'll leave things unnamed because 
there's always an out.

48
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:11,041
It's like.
And it's the same thing when you're 

49
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,641
living together with someone.
You know that people who live together 

50
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:12,641
before they're married are more likely 
to get divorced,

51
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:14,240
not less likely.
And the reason for that is,

52
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,060
what exactly are you saying to one 
another when you live with each other?

53
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,850
Just think about it.
Well,

54
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,050
for now you're better than anything else
I can trick,

55
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,250
but I'd like to reserve the right to 
trade you in conveniently.

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,820
If someone happens to stumble into me,

57
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,880
well how can,
how can ?

58
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,810
Someone

59
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,270
not be insulted to their core by an 
offer like that.

60
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,480
Now they're willing to play along with 
it because they're going to do the same 

61
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,480
thing with you.
That will.

62
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,480
That's exactly it.
It's like,

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,940
yeah,
yeah,

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I know you're not going to commit to me.
So that means you don't value me or our 

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,490
relationship above everything else,
but as long as I get to escape,

66
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:05,440
if I need to,
then I'm willing to put up with that.

67
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,480
It's like that's a hell of a thing.
I mean,

68
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:12,481
you might think,
how stupid is it to shackle yourself to 

69
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:12,481
someone?
It's like,

70
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:12,481
it's stupid,
man.

71
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:14,470
There's no doubt about that,
but compared to the alternatives,

72
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,160
it's pretty damn good because without 
that shackling,

73
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,940
there are things you will never ever 
learned because you'll avoid them.

74
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,430
You can always leave and if you can 
leave,

75
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,990
then you don't have to tell each other 
the truth.

76
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,290
It's as simple as that because you can 
just leave and then you don't have 

77
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:31,290
anyone.
You can tell the truth too.
