1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,050
Consider the overwhelming success as a 
Patreon account the money raised by 

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,501
rebel.
What will you be doing with the 

3
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:08,501
contributions?
Well,

4
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:08,501
that's great.
Alright,

5
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:10,130
so I've got a couple of things to say 
about that.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,970
So the first one is,
you know,

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,810
I would say a number of people have been
attempt and not an overwhelming number,

8
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:22,811
but a number of people have been 
attempting to take me to task for the 

9
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:25,550
fact that my Patreon support has been,
let's call it overwhelmingly successful.

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,060
And so I'll tell you how I formulate my 
response to that.

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,700
The first is I'm generating almost all 
of my content and making it completely 

12
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:39,350
publicly accessible so it's free,
right?

13
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:42,590
And,
and so that way I'm bringing,

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,910
I think awareness of psychological 
issues to a very large number of people.

15
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:51,911
And so far at the moment my view count 
on Youtube is up to $30 million and I 

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,730
did a little bit of calculations last 
week to try to figure out what the total

17
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:57,270
view count was,
um,

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,350
for,
for the cuts of my lectures that have 

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:03,350
been appearing on Youtube.

20
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,930
And then the political material as well.
And I think it's upward of $50 million 

21
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,770
and so I'm making psychological and 
political content available to $50 

22
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:11,770
million people.
And so,

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,450
you know,
that seems like a reasonable thing to do

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,440
now.
People who don't agree with what I'm 

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:20,440
saying might differ,
but I think that could be separated from

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,730
the educational content as well.
So,

27
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:26,060
and then with regards to the Patriot on 
subscribers,

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,420
every single person who's doing that is 
doing it entirely voluntarily.

29
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:34,421
And I also set up that Patriot on 
account long before any of this 

30
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:35,090
political material emerged.
So.

31
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,250
And my sense with the patron viewers,
and you guys can clue me in if I'm wrong

32
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:42,680
about this,
is that there's two things happening.

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,840
One is it enables people who are not 
very happy about the current political 

34
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,971
situation in the west to to,
to contribute to something that might be

35
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,740
at least to some degree attempting to 
stem the tide of such things as toxic 

36
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,121
political correctness and second,
that it enables people to support my 

37
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:09,551
endeavors,
to bring general education to a wider 

38
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:12,701
audience.
And that seems like a good deal for 

39
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:12,701
everyone.
And,

40
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:12,701
you know,
you might say,

41
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:13,550
well,
it's a particularly good deal for me and

42
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,980
I'm certainly not complaining about 
what's happening,

43
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:20,981
but I would also point out that it 
hasn't exactly been a straightforward 

44
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,790
thing.
And so,

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,580
um,

46
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,700
so I guess if anyone else wants to try 
it,

47
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:32,190
they're more than welcome to.
Now having said that,

48
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,950
um,
I would also say that the real issue 

49
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,361
here,
and I think this is the fact that this 

50
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,971
isn't self evident,
is also a commentary on the toxicity of 

51
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,540
our culture at the moment,
is that it actually isn't the issue.

52
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,940
The issue isn't really how much money 
you have.

53
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,320
I think that that's a resentful and at 
relatively vicious way of judging 

54
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,611
someone else.
I think the issue is what you do with 

55
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:58,950
the money when you have it.
And you know,

56
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,590
I'm,
I'm not a particularly hedonistic person

57
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,540
and I'm not 25 years old,
you know,

58
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,500
I'm 55 years old and I'm going to be a 
grandfather and a couple of months,

59
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,790
you know,
thank God for that.

60
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,660
Um,
and what I want to do with that money is

61
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,360
to do the best things I can possibly 
think of to do with it.

62
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:17,980
And one of the things I'm thinking 
about,

63
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:22,981
I started this biblical series and a lot
of that's helped thankful thanks to you 

64
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:26,551
guys on Patrion because that enabled me 
to generate the capital that was 

65
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:29,740
necessary to rent the theater because 
for 12 lectures that was a $60,000

66
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:32,140
investment about that,
something like that.

67
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,880
And then another $8,000
for the,

68
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,930
for the camera work.
And that had to be basically dealt with 

69
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,140
upfront.
So it was a reasonable financial risks.

70
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:46,141
Now I've been crazily fortunate in that 
theater tickets have also sold out,

71
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:52,261
so it looks like the biblical series 
will pay for itself with some extra 

72
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:52,261
leftover.
And so,

73
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:53,950
you know,
I'm pretty happy about that because that

74
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,860
gives me some more working capital.
And then you might say,

75
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,510
well what am I going to do with the 
capital?

76
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,750
Well,
I'm going to continue doing the sorts of

77
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:06,751
things that I'm already doing.
I want to do a series on the hundred 

78
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:07,600
greatest books of the western Canon.
For example.

79
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,840
I want to move genuine humanities 
education out of the universities where 

80
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,081
it isn't being taught anyways as far as 
I can tell online where people can 

81
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:20,941
access it freely.
I'm talking to a wide variety of people 

82
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:24,571
right now about trying to do that in a 
more formal sense so that the 

83
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:28,381
possibility for widespread university 
education can be universally accessible 

84
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:33,271
and one of the things we're trying to 
crack is the problem of how to teach 

85
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:33,271
people to write.

86
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:34,810
Because that's a real troublesome thing.
And by the way,

87
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:38,680
you know you guys,
if you go onto my website,

88
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:43,681
Jordan Peterson.com
and you go into courses and you go into 

89
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:47,980
psychology for 30.
If you look carefully there,

90
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:52,981
you'll see that there's an essay rubric 
that tells people how to write and 

91
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:56,880
actually that's become quite popular.
And so if you're interested in how to 

92
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,481
learn to write,
I've written something about that 

93
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:02,431
already and we're going to make a piece 
of software that's going to help people 

94
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:05,071
learn to write.
And so I've got plans for how to make 

95
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,090
writing education broadly accessible to 
people,

96
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:12,091
so I would like to make humanities 
education of the highest order broadly 

97
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:14,260
accessible to people and I also want to 
teach them how to write and I'm going to

98
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:17,530
try to crack the online university 
accreditation problem.

99
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,610
And so part of the money that,
or a substantial proportion of the money

100
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:24,640
that is being donated to me,
let's say,

101
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:28,180
or is being offered to me by my monthly 
supporters.

102
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,230
So that's all of you people is going to 
be going to projects exactly like that.

103
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,500
And the reason for that is that,
what the hell else would I do with the 

104
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:37,500
money?
You know,

105
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,130
I mean,
to me money is a tool.

106
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,270
It's not,
it's not the means whereby you develop a

107
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:48,271
luxurious lifestyle and spend your time 
burning yourself half to death in the 

108
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:50,830
sun and the Caribbean snorting cocaine 
and chasing hookers,

109
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:52,030
you know,
it's just,

110
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,580
that's just not in the cards for me.
Um,

111
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,910
and,
and so I want to devote it towards the 

112
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,460
sorts of things that I've already been 
pursuing except on a broader scale.

113
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,320
And so,
you know,

114
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:08,321
and I think people like Elan Musk to,
not that I'm comparing myself to Elon 

115
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:12,550
Musk,
but I mean he has plenty of money and I 

116
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,550
mean you really,
somebody's got to have the damn money.

117
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,530
It might as well be people who have the 
kind of vision that people like he does 

118
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,440
have because maybe they'll do something 
good for the world.

119
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,440
I mean I hope his gigafactories produce 
batteries like mad so that we can start 

120
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:29,870
to make alternative energy sources 
economically viable and maybe reduce our

121
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:34,871
dependence on oil and maybe get 
ourselves out from underneath the thumb 

122
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:35,450
of the Saudi Arab.
So that would be a good thing.

123
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,080
So the monetary issue,
it's,

124
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:43,140
it's quite interesting.
It's like it is not that you have the 

125
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,140
money,
it's what you do with it.

126
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,310
And so anyways,
those are,

127
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:46,820
some of them might plants and that isn't
all of them because I'm going to come up

128
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:51,821
with a bunch more plans and I'm going to
try to implement them as rapidly as I 

129
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:54,911
possibly can.
I've put my clinical practice on hiatus 

130
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:59,381
for the next three months so that I have
a chance to think and I've requested 

131
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:00,830
that the university advanced my 
sabbatical by one year,

132
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:05,831
so I should have about a year to think 
about what I should be doing with 

133
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:09,581
youtube and how I can be promoting broad
public education of the highest quality 

134
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,270
and that's a really fun problem to solve
and the fact that I'm being supported by

135
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,890
all of you people on Patrion makes the 
probability that avail to all be able to

136
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:22,220
devote my time to that much higher.

137
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,130
So,
so that's what I'm going to do with it.

138
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:27,980
I'm going to do the best things I can 
possibly think of to do with it.

139
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,680
And uh,
hopefully that'll work.

140
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,350
And so far it seems to be going well.
So,

141
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,080
um,
yeah,

142
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,870
I mean I've been taking them back quite 
a bit by the.

143
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,930
I mean it's not surprising that the 
people who've been trying to take me 

144
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,231
down,
let's say are squawking and bitching 

145
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:49,130
because I happened to be a generating a 
fairly reasonable income from this.

146
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,870
Although I don't think about it as an 
income,

147
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,640
as I already said,
I think about it as a,

148
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,390
as a toolkit for pursuing more 
interesting things.

149
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,710
It's like if that's the best they can do
with regards to continuing to tarnish my

150
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:01,850
name,
well then let them,

151
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,180
let them go right ahead about that and I
think the proof is in the outcome and 

152
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,120
the biblical series and that's a direct 
consequence of the Patriot and support 

153
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,170
that seems to be going like mad.
I think you know,

154
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:19,171
about 500,000
people have watched the videos so far 

155
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:20,540
with another who knows,
tens of thousands of people listening to

156
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,210
the podcasts and that's just a bloody 
miracle that,

157
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:28,211
that many people would be interested in 
what I consider the fundamental 

158
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:30,770
foundation for any true humanities 
education.

159
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,480
So great.
We'll build from there.

160
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,270
And so that's,
that's what I'm gonna do with the money.

161
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,390
So.
And if people don't like that,

162
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:41,240
then they don't have to donate or they 
don't have to subscribe.

163
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:43,130
It's hardly like it's mandatory.
