1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,970
So people often ask me,
do you believe in God,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,310
which I don't,
I don't like that question.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,600
First of all,
it's an attempt to to.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,920
It's an attempt to box me in in a sense,
and the reason that it's an attempt to 

5
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:20,931
box me in is because the question is 
asked so that I can be firmly placed on 

6
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:24,990
one side of a two of a binary argument.
And,

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,000
and the reason I don't like to answer it
is because a,

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,010
I don't like to be boxed in and B,
because I don't know what the person 

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,941
means by believe or God and they think 
they know and the probability that they 

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,320
construe belief and construed God the 
same way I do is virtually zero.

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,990
So it's,
it's a question that doesn't work for me

12
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:50,610
on multiple levels of analysis,
but strangely enough,

13
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:55,611
just as we were talking,
I the answer to that question popped 

14
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:55,611
into my head.

15
00:00:55,611 --> 00:01:00,260
I act as if God exists.
Now you can decide for yourself whether 

16
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,990
that means that I believe in him,
so to speak,

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,390
but I act as if he exists.
So that's a good enough answer for that.

18
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,470
Then with regards to these other issues,
the divinity of Christ,

19
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:18,471
well,
I would say the same problems with the 

20
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:21,501
question formulation obtain what do you 
mean by divine and also what do you mean

21
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:23,580
by Christ?
These are very,

22
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:25,470
very difficult questions.
Now,

23
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:28,170
I believe that for all intents and 
purposes,

24
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,860
I believe that the logos is divine in so
far as we.

25
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,310
If if by divine you mean of ultimate 
value of ultimate transcendent value.

26
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,990
Yes,
it's divine.

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,500
It's associated with death and rebirth 
clearly because the logo's dismantles 

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,151
you and rebuilds you,
so that's what happens when you make an 

29
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:50,151
error.
When you make an error,

30
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,720
some part of you has to go.

31
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,820
That's the sacrifice you have to let it 
go.

32
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,560
Sometimes it's a big part of you.
It's,

33
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,490
it's sometimes it can be such a big part
of you that you actually die,

34
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,670
right?
Instead of dying and being reborn,

35
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,060
is there something more than merely 
metaphorical about the idea of being of 

36
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,490
dying and being reborn?
Yes,

37
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:13,491
there is.
Because those are associated with 

38
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:13,491
physiological transformations.
How?

39
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:17,220
What's the ultimate extent of that?
That's a good question.

40
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,980
You know,
the question is what happens to the 

41
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,001
world around you as you embark,
as you increasingly embody the logos and

42
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:31,710
the answer to that is we don't know.
We don't know what the ultimate level of

43
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,510
this.
Now the hypothesis is,

44
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:36,900
and it's a hypothesis that extends to 
some degree to Buddha as well.

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,200
The hypothesis is that there has been 
one or two individuals who managed that 

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,750
and that in their management of that 
they transcended death itself.

47
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,120
Well then you might ask yourself,
well,

48
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:51,300
what do you mean by transcended death?
Well,

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,360
in the case of Christ,
let's assume he was a historical figure 

50
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,360
for the,
for the time being,

51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,290
which I think is the simplest thing to 
assume.

52
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,060
Uhm,
I think there is sufficient evidence to 

53
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,060
conclude that you could conclude 
otherwise,

54
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,851
but I personally,
I feel that there's sufficient evidence 

55
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:08,851
to conclude that.

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Did He,
is his resurrection real but his spirit 

57
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:20,580
lives on.
That's certainly the case.

58
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,190
In what sense do you mean spirit?
Just to qualify that,

59
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,340
how well let,
let's imagine that a spirit is a pattern

60
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:33,970
of being and we know that patterns can 
exist.

61
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:37,500
Independent patterns can be transmitted 
across multiple substrates,

62
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,070
right?
Vinyl,

63
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,920
electronic impulses,
air vibrations in your ear,

64
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,900
neurological patterns,
dance,

65
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,410
so all the translation of what you might
describe as a spirit,

66
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,310
right?
It's,

67
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,160
it's that pattern.
It's independent of its material,

68
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:55,420
substrate.
Well,

69
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,650
Christ spirit lives on it.
It's,

70
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:58,940
it's,
uh,

71
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,840
it's had a massive effect across time.
Well,

72
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,290
is that an answer to the question?
Did his body resurrect?

73
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,140
I don't know.
I don't know.

74
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,810
It is.
The accounts aren't clear for one thing.

75
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,320
What the accounts mean isn't clear.
I don't know what happened to a person 

76
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:27,990
if they bring themselves completely into
alignment.

77
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,870
I've had intimations of what that might 
mean.

78
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,010
We don't understand the world very well.
We don't understand how the world could 

79
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:40,890
be mastered if it was mastered 
completely.

80
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:43,680
We don't know how an individual might be
able to manage that.

81
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,680
We don't know what transformations that 
might make possible.
