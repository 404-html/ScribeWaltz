1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,030
Unknown unknown's,
well,

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,920
unknown,
unknown unknowns,

3
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:08,921
leap at you from places that you 
wouldn't expect because otherwise you 

4
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:13,241
would have planned for the damn thing.
So there are the things that are always 

5
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:14,600
like poking their beak off at you when 
you least expect it.

6
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:17,120
They're just like,
say serpents in the garden of Eden.

7
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:18,590
That might be one way of thinking about 
it.

8
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:23,591
You can't keep the damn snakes out of 
the garden and that's because you can't 

9
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,580
make a bounded area and keep the 
complexity out of it.

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,790
The complexity always sneaks back in.
Try protecting your children from the 

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,370
Internet.
For example.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,180
You can't make a bounded circumstance 
and get rid of all the complexity.

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,140
It always comes sneaking back in.
So what would be an unknown?

14
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:40,340
Unknown.
This is a good one.

15
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,530
Here.
You have an intimate relationship.

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,320
You've had it for 10 years.
You Trust your partner,

17
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,200
so what does that mean?
You know what,

18
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:52,201
where you are,
you know who you are and you have a 

19
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:53,500
pretty good idea of who of where you're 
going,

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,360
and then one day you'll find out that 
your partner has been cheating on you,

21
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,690
not with one person but with three 
people and for the whole 10 years.

22
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,910
Well,
hypothetically,

23
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:08,911
that comes as a shock.
Although you may have ignored many 

24
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:11,320
intimations that such might be the case 
irrelevant.

25
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,660
Let's say it comes as a shock.
Well,

26
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:14,680
what happens to you?

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,330
Well,
you don't know where you are.

28
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,220
You don't know where you've been.
That's interesting.

29
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:26,221
Okay,
because you think you know where you've 

30
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:26,221
been because you've already been there,
but all of a sudden something can happen

31
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:31,040
so that you are so flipped over that you
don't even know where you were.

32
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,650
So that means in some sense,
the past is dependent on the present.

33
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,470
A very peculiar thing.
You also have no idea where you're going

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,360
in terms of not knowing where you are.
That's Deep Bay because you might think,

35
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:51,361
well,
I know I thought it was in a marriage 

36
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,431
that turns out to be wrong.
I thought I knew who my wife or husband 

37
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:56,821
was that turns out to be wrong.
I concluded on the basis that I knew my 

38
00:01:57,221 --> 00:02:02,221
wife,
that I knew something about women that 

39
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:04,891
turned out to be wrong.
I thought I was in a relationship with 

40
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,540
someone I could trust that is wrong.
I don't know enough about trust.

41
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,570
I'm obviously too gullible and so what 
that does is throw virtually everything 

42
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,710
that's ever happened to me in severe 
doubt,

43
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,150
right?
That's the emergence of chaos and that

44
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,030
yes,
sometimes you're going from point a to 

45
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,671
point b and something you don't expect 
manifests itself in the middle of your 

46
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:33,571
plan,
but it's not such a catastrophe because 

47
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,791
you can just work around it and then 
sometimes something pops up and like you

48
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:40,861
just do not have a plan anymore,
and so then you might ask yourself just 

49
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,060
exactly where you are.
You when you don't know where you are,

50
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,690
and I would say that's our place and 
it's actually a place that's well 

51
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,090
documented in classic religious and 
mythological stories.

52
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,250
That's chaos.
The Dallas,

53
00:02:54,251 --> 00:02:59,251
for example,
they believe that the world is made out 

54
00:02:59,251 --> 00:02:59,251
of chaos and order order.
That's where you,

55
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:02,950
when you do gets you what you want,
chaos.

56
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,880
That's where you are.
When you have no idea what's going on 

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:08,880
and you might ask,
well,

58
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,900
is there a way that you should act when 
you're in chaos and the answer to that 

59
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,681
is there better be because it's a place 
you're going to visit several times 

60
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:18,970
during your life and everyone visits 
that.

61
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,260
That's why it's an archetypal story.
That's the dissent to the underground.

62
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,980
Underground is that horrible place that 
lurks underneath all of our 

63
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,200
presuppositions.
It's the frigid lake underneath the thin

64
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:37,201
ice that everybody's skating on and it's
something that can manifest itself at 

65
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:41,101
any moment.
That's partly why in the Dallas 

66
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:41,101
Assemble,
the Black Paisley is chaos by the way,

67
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:44,740
and the White Paisley is ordered in the 
order Paisley.

68
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,570
There's a little black dot.
Well,

69
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:50,110
that's because order can turn into chaos
and does at any moment,

70
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,910
and the reverse is also true chaos.
Paternity to order at any moment and 

71
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,970
insight will do that for you.
You know,

72
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,520
alcoholics report that when they hit 
bottom,

73
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:05,521
it's like there's a patella system.
They look at the world in a different 

74
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:05,521
way.
You know,

75
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:07,420
now they're a new person.
They're back from an underground.

76
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,270
They've risen from the dead,
so to speak.

77
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,750
You know,
and it's partly because what it looks 

78
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,750
like,
your right hemisphere is pretty good at.

79
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,390
I'm inferring patterns in,
in,

80
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:22,460
in novel and chaotic places.
It's kind of keeping track of things 

81
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,101
that happened to you that are anomalous 
and it makes alternative maps of the 

82
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:29,911
world that are there for you to rely on,
at least to some degree if that ever 

83
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:29,911
becomes necessary.
