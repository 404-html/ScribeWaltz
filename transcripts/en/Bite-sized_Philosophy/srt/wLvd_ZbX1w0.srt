1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,150
It's not an accident that the axiomatic 
western individual as someone who was 

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:09,630
unfairly nailed to a cross and tortured,
it's like,

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,130
yes.
Right.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,710
Exactly.
So what do you do about that?

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,970
Well,
I thought about that for a long time 

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:22,970
too.
It's like,

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,290
well,
you don't get together and a damn bb 

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,380
because all that does is allow you to be
as horrible as you could possibly 

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,380
imagine in suffer from none of the 
consequences.

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,980
That's a bad idea.
So how about we don't do that?

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,130
Well,
there's a deep Heidi in the west too.

12
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:40,860
It's like,
pick up your damn suffering.

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,350
And Barrett,
I try to be a good person.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,650
So you don't make it worse.
Well,

15
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:51,600
that's a truth.
You know,

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,550
I read a lot about the terrible things 
that people have done to each other.

17
00:00:56,551 --> 00:01:00,840
You just cannot even imagine it so 
awful.

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,550
So you don't want to be someone like 
that.

19
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,320
No.
Do you have a reason to be?

20
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,070
Yes.
You have a lots of reasons to be God.

21
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,590
There's reasons to be resentful about 
your existence.

22
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:16,100
Everyone you know is gonna die.
You know you too.

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,220
And there's going to be a fair bit of 
pain along the way and lots of it's 

24
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:21,220
going to be unfair.
It's like,

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,910
yeah,
no wonder you're resentful.

26
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,250
It's like acted out and see what 
happens.

27
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,000
You make everything you're complaining 
about infinitely worse.

28
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,080
There's this idea that hell is a 
bottomless pit and that's because no 

29
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,840
matter how bad it is,
some stupid son of a bitch,

30
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:38,750
like you could figure out a way to make 
it a lot worse.

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,880
So you think,
well,

32
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,360
what do you do about that?
While you accept it,

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,760
that's what life is like.
It's suffering.

34
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,480
That's what the religious people have 
always said,

35
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:52,940
life is suffering.
Yes.

36
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,650
Well,
who wants to admit that?

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,120
Well,
just think about it.

38
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Well,
so what do you do in the face of that 

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:01,790
suffering?
Trying to reduce it.

40
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,350
Start with yourself.
What good are you?

41
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,500
Get yourself together for Christ's sake 
so that when your father dies,

42
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:13,501
you're not wining away in a corner and 
you can help plan the funeral and you 

43
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,370
can stand up solidly so that people can 
rely on you.

44
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,070
That's better.
It will be a damn victim.

45
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,730
You're a victim.
Jesus obviously

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,150
put yourself together and then maybe if 
you put yourself together,

47
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:29,340
you know how to do that.
You know what's wrong with you.

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,400
If you'll admit it,
you know there's a few things you could 

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,130
like Polish up a little bit that you 
might even be able to manage.

50
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,410
You're insufficient present condition 
and so you might shine yourself up a 

51
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,080
little bit and then your eyes will be a 
little more open.

52
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,260
Then you can try and yourself up a 
little bit more and then maybe you could

53
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,890
bring your family together instead of 
having them be the hateful,

54
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:53,891
spiteful,
neurotic in fighting batch that you're 

55
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:54,920
doomed to spend Christmas with.

56
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,870
So when you fix yourself a little bit 
kind of humbly because you don't go on,

57
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,020
you're a fixer upper.
If there ever was one and then you got 

58
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,020
to figure out,
well,

59
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,650
but can you figure out how to make peace
with your idiot brother?

60
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:11,320
And probably not because he's just as 
dumb as you.

61
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:16,321
So the holiday hell are you gonna manage
that and so then you maybe you get 

62
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,130
somewhere that way and your family sort 
of functioning and you find out,

63
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,620
well that kind of relieved a little bit 
of suffering,

64
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:25,621
although it reduced the opportunities 
for spiteful revenge and that's kind of 

65
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:29,761
a pain in the neck and so then you get 
your family together a little bit and 

66
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:34,390
your little clued in.
Then at least a bit because you've done 

67
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,810
something difficult that's actually 
difficult.

68
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,980
You're a little wiser and so then maybe 
you could put a tend to do finger out 

69
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,760
beyond the family and try to change some
little thing without wrecking it.

70
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,010
It's like our society is complex and we 
teach our students that they could just 

71
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,081
fix it.
It's like go fix a military helicopter 

72
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:53,570
and see how far you get with that.
It's like you're already going to dude.

73
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,050
You're like a chimp with a wrench.
Whack.

74
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,670
Oh look,
it's better.

75
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,930
It's like,
no,

76
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,020
it's not better.
Things are complicated and to fix things

77
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:07,021
is really hard and you have to be like a
golden tool to fix things and you're 

78
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,510
not.
So,

79
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,760
and that's the other message of the 
West.

80
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,300
It's like how do you overcome the 
suffering of the of life?

81
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,420
And I'm not saying it's only the message
of the West.

82
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,560
How do you overcome the suffering of 
life has been a better person.

83
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,200
That's how you do it.
Well,

84
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:31,201
that's hard.
It takes responsibility and I think you 

85
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:31,420
know,
if you said to someone,

86
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,530
you want to have a meaningful life,
everything you do matters.

87
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,870
That's the definition of a meaningful 
life,

88
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,050
but everything you do matters,
it's going to have to carry that with 

89
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,951
you.
Or do you want to just forget about the 

90
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:50,311
whole meaning thing and then you don't 
have any responsibility because who the 

91
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:52,570
hell cares and you can wander through 
life doing whatever you want,

92
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,600
gratifying,
impulsive desires for how useful that's 

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,900
going to be and you're stuck in 
meaninglessness,

94
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:01,570
but you don't have any responsibility.
Which one do you want?

95
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,650
Well,
ask yourself which one are you pursuing?

96
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,010
And you'll find very rapidly that it 
isn't the majority of your soul that's 

97
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,911
pursuing the whole meaning thing because
well look what you have to do to do 

98
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:15,290
that.
Yeah.

99
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,520
Have to take on the fact that life is 
suffering and you have put yourself 

100
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,880
together in the face of that.
Well,

101
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:23,350
that's hard.
Christ.

102
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:25,060
It's amazing.
People can even do it.

103
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,300
I'm stunned every day when I go outside 
and it isn't a route a riot with 

104
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,290
everything burning.
You can really.

105
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,970
God,
you talked to people.

106
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:38,971
It's like I knew this guy.
He'd been in a motorcycle accident and 

107
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,420
it really ruined him and he was like a 
linesman,

108
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:45,421
you know,
working on the power and he was working 

109
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:47,311
with someone who had Parkinson's disease
and they had complimentary inadequacies 

110
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,950
and so two of them could do the job of 
one person and so they're out there 

111
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,761
fixing power lines in the freezing cold 
despite the fact that one was three 

112
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:59,960
quarters erect with motorcycle accident.
The other one had Parkinson's.

113
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:02,600
It's like that's how our civilization 
works.

114
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:05,090
It's like there's all these ruled people
out there.

115
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:08,090
They've got problems like you can't 
believe off.

116
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:10,910
They go to work and do things they don't
even like and look,

117
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,620
the lights are on.
My God.

118
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:13,850
It's unbelievable.
It's,

119
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,800
it's a miracle.
It's a miracle and we're so ungrateful.

120
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,020
College students,
the postmodern types,

121
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:23,090
they're so ungrateful,
you know,

122
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,420
they don't know that they're surrounded 
by just a bloody miracle.

123
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:28,340
It's a miracle that all this stuff 
works,

124
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,390
but all you crazy chimpanzees that don't
know each other can sit in the same room

125
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:37,391
for two hours,
sweltering away without tearing each 

126
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:38,360
other apart because that's what chimps 
do.

127
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,470
So

128
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,190
anyways,
so what happened?

129
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:52,191
Well,
I made some videos and I got to the 

130
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:52,191
bottom of some things at least as far as
I can tell.

131
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:57,111
So I told you what the bottom is and 
then I got this idea about what you 

132
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:57,690
might do about it,
which isn't my idea.

133
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,120
It's like it's not my idea.
It's an old,

134
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:00,840
old,
old,

135
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:03,270
old idea.
It's far older than Christianity.

136
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,180
It's old.
It's the oldest story of mankind.

137
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,520
Get yourself together,
transcend your suffering.

138
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,650
See if you can be some kind of hero.
Make the suffering in the world less.

139
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,580
Well,
that's the way forward as far as I can 

140
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:22,580
tell,
if there is any way forward.

141
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,850
Knots,
what's under assault by the 

142
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,461
postmodernists,
so look out because they know exactly 

143
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:29,910
what they're doing and they know exactly
why they're doing it.
