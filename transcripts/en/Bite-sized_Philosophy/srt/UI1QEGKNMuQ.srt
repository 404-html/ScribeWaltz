1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,610
Eighty percent of humanities papers are 
not sighted once

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:05,960
so.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,560
Well,
so.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,750
So let's just translate that for the 
viewing public.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,810
Yes.
That means that they're producing 

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:15,980
scholarship that nobody looks at,
that even their friends don't

7
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,680
look out because.
Okay.

8
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:22,681
So what a citation is is I read 
someone's paper and I find a good idea 

9
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:25,951
in it.
And then I used that idea to buttress 

10
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:25,951
and idea of my own or to,
or to,

11
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:27,040
or to riff off or to,
or to,

12
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,790
or to criticize even for that matter.
And then I cite them,

13
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,530
I say who they were and when they 
published it.

14
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:33,740
And then the paper,
the,

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,260
that there's a huge bureaucracy that 
keeps track of citations.

16
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,870
It's a major indication of academic 
ability to be cited,

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,320
right?
It's,

18
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:42,090
it's,
it's the,

19
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,950
it's like it's academic payment to be 
cited.

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,190
Okay.
So 80 percent of humanities papers don't

21
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:53,191
get cited once.
It's absolute failure is absolute 

22
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:55,540
failure as a game.
If someone wanted to play a game,

23
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,900
uh,
I would suggest that they go and they 

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,031
look at the publications of the 
professors in a particular area and see 

25
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:08,401
if the titles all sound the same and if 
they all say something about 

26
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,560
intersectionality,
a colonialism and,

27
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:18,561
and these other various social justice 
words you might wonder,

28
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,420
am I going to get taught the same course
again and again by every professor in 

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,550
this program because it seems to me that
all of their research is very similar.

30
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,970
Uh,
and,

31
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,030
and how can that be when there's such a 
broad base of knowledge and the world 

32
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,380
that we can have such similarity between
every publication,

33
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,140
which then goes on.
Why?

34
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,720
Why do I need to read my colleague stuff
when it's exactly like my own,

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,030
which,
which we see.

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,490
So just just as a baseline Jordan,
how,

37
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,610
like,
what,

38
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,620
what would you say is,
is someone who's doing some good 

39
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:54,620
research?
What's,

40
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,870
how many citations would,
would they be receiving?

41
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:58,800
Maybe a collectively like what are we 
looking at?

42
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,890
Thousands.
Thousands?

43
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,340
Yeah.
Well,

44
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:01,660
a good,
like if you,

45
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,300
if you write a good paper

46
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,450
then like a great paypal,
paypal will get you 100 citations,

47
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:14,451
right?
An outstanding overwhelmingly 

48
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:14,460
outstanding paper.
I'll get you a thousand citations.

49
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,520
Um,
10 isn't none,

50
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,800
you know,
if you register with 10,

51
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,070
but zero is failure,
right?

52
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,250
It means your work had zero impact.
It means your work wasn't worth the 

53
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,020
paper it was published on.
And this,

54
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,050
this brings us to a kind of interesting 
little issue with regards to the rot in 

55
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,680
the universities,
which,

56
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,870
which Deborah mccloud she says does not 
exist.

57
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:41,871
It's like here's how the game works is 
that we set up a little ideological 

58
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:42,540
garden,
right?

59
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:47,541
The 10 of us play in and then we all 
publish in the same journal and we peer 

60
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,620
review each other's articles and we just
publish them.

61
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,420
There's no critique or very little.
So the,

62
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,030
the barrier for publication is very,
very low when it should be very high,

63
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:59,650
like a good journal,
a good journal reject.

64
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,770
Ninety percent of the papers that are,
uh,

65
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,330
that are,
are,

66
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,360
are,
are,

67
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,200
are submitted to it,
right?

68
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,440
So I'm rejection rates really matter.
So the question is why do the these 

69
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,150
papers get published since no one reads 
them and they have nothing to offer and 

70
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,730
the answer to that,
and it's very straightforward.

71
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,660
The journals are extremely expensive,
are way more expensive than they should 

72
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,080
be.
So just to buy a single paper online for

73
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:31,081
the ordinary person is like $40,
which is more than a hardcover book 

74
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:33,160
that's just to download the PDF.
And so the journal itself,

75
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,860
the libraries are full of them,
are very expensive and the subscriptions

76
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:40,861
are very expensive.
And so what happens is the professors 

77
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:44,190
pressure the university libraries to by 
the journals and the library funds the 

78
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,110
publisher and so the publishers will 
publish anything.

79
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:52,111
Routledge is a good example of that,
much to my chagrin because they 

80
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:55,171
published my first book but.
And they used to be a great publishing 

81
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:55,171
house,
but they'll publish damn near anything.

82
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:59,731
And the reason for that is that the 
libraries are forced to pay radically 

83
00:03:59,731 --> 00:04:03,010
inflated prices for the publications 
that no one ever reads.

84
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,160
And so people right to publish in 
journals that libraries have to purchase

85
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:13,000
at inflated prices to produce knowledge 
that no one will ever read.

86
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,510
And that's the little scandal that 
plagues the humanities.

87
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:18,990
I think it characterizes the humanities 
more than plagues them.
