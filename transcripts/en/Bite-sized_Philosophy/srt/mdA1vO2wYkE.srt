1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,230
Is there a way to find your true passion
or is that just a cliche,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,830
was definitely a cliche and it and it,
you know,

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,040
it,
it's the sort of thing that actually 

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,081
annoys me quite a lot about new age 
thinkers and I would more or less put 

5
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,220
Joseph Campbell in that category.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,510
Um,

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,180
I think you can find what compels you 
and what might enable you to live in a 

8
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:32,280
high quality manner despite the 
suffering that's associated with life.

9
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:37,281
I think you can discover that and I 
think part of the way you discover that 

10
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:40,430
is by watching yourself and learning 
when it is that you're meaningfully 

11
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:41,580
engaged.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,920
You have to notice that it's something 
that happens to you in some sense rather

13
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:53,921
than something that you do.
You have to notice when you're 

14
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:57,460
meaningfully engaged and then you have 
to work to expand the amount of time 

15
00:00:57,801 --> 00:01:02,801
that you spend in that state.
But I would also say that there are 

16
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:05,090
moral requirements that go along with 
that too because you might say,

17
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:10,091
well,
what if you happen to be the sort of 

18
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:10,091
person,
for example,

19
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:12,020
who finds torturing small animals 
meaningfully engaging?

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,620
I'm like,
it seems like that's a,

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,120
that's the sort of meaningful engagement
that you probably don't want to expand.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,480
So I would say that if you're going to 
set up your life so that you maximize 

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,090
your meaningful engagement,
you have to.

24
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,420
There's a number of other things that 
you have to do at the same time.

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,780
And one of those is that you have to get
very clear about who you are and what 

26
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:40,151
you're doing.
And so although this would be grounds 

27
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:43,301
for a much longer discussion,
I think that one of the things that you 

28
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:45,350
have to do if you're going to attempt to
maximize,

29
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:50,351
make meaningful engagement,
is that you also have to do such things 

30
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:50,351
as

31
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,320
um,

32
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,830
endeavor to stop deceiving yourself and 
other people in every way you possibly 

33
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,511
can.
And part of the reason for that is that 

34
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:06,081
if you engage in deception of any sort,
you pathologize the structure first,

35
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,170
the structure of your being.
But you could say you pathologize the 

36
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,730
structure of your nervous system and 
then you can't trust it's reports.

37
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,390
So if you're,
if you're going to rely on your nervous 

38
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,031
system's reports of meaningful 
engagement to guide your future 

39
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:27,270
activities,
you better do everything you can to make

40
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:32,271
sure that you're not filling that 
nervous system with the kind of garbage 

41
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:32,970
that's going to make it malfunctioned 
and giving again,

42
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:37,971
give you a false reports.
So I think that moving towards 

43
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:41,520
meaningful engagement has to be 
associated with making truth,

44
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:46,521
your highest value because otherwise you
can't trust yourself as your own guide 

45
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,660
in the Catholics have struggled with 
this for a long time from a theological 

46
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:51,840
perspective because the Catholic 
position,

47
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,170
roughly speaking,
is that human beings are so steeped in 

48
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,901
sin that they can't trust their own 
instincts in relationship to good and 

49
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:03,340
evil and have to use the church and the 
priesthood as an intermediary.

50
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,440
And you know,
you can obviously have an argument about

51
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:11,380
that and of course Protestants have 
historically done that,

52
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:13,210
but you've got to give the Catholics 
there do.

53
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,270
It's like people aren't pure by nature 
and only traveled in their vision by 

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,760
it'll sociological impediments there.
Also corrupt beyond belief individually 

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,090
and have to use society as a source of 
value.

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,720
So if you're going to personalize your 
life in some sense,

57
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,410
you better act in a manner that makes 
you a reliable guide.
