1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,040
Firstly,
I want to say thank you so much,

2
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:06,730
those an amazing talk and I was 
wondering if you could elaborate.

3
00:00:06,731 --> 00:00:11,731
What I noticed a lot,
I go here to UBC is that a lot of 

4
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:13,060
students and young people,
they're often desensitized to,

5
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:18,061
for example,
the atrocities that communism or 

6
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:20,671
ideologies that forged terrorism and 
maybe it's some sort of Stockholm 

7
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,710
syndrome that I'm seeing where it's like
people are just,

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,380
they're,
they're like trapped and they can't.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,250
They feel in a way they can't do 
anything about it and then they start to

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,720
like,
like,

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,790
like communism or they start to see more
social or adopt socialist policy that in

12
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:41,791
the end we'll get them killed.
We'll get them hurt as long as you kind 

13
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,830
of elaborate on what you think can be 
done about that or even if something can

14
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:46,420
be done in that respect.

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,510
Well,
I think something can be done.

16
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:53,511
I mean I've been trying to educate 
people about the horrors of the Nazi 

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,620
regime in the Soviet regime in 
particular.

18
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:00,220
I've concentrated mostly on those two 
cars,

19
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:05,221
but that's good enough and trying to let
people know that it was through the 

20
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:09,750
fault of people,
much like them,

21
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:14,751
that those systems are rows and,
and that there are steps you can take to

22
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:21,681
limit the probability that you would 
participate in such a thing and that 

23
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:25,701
those steps are associated with trying 
to be truthful in your speech and 

24
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:29,691
actions because the stability of those 
systems depends on the willingness of 

25
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:33,771
individuals to lie and,
and also on your willingness to take 

26
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:37,530
responsibility for the malevolence in 
your own heart.

27
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,320
That manifests itself in those social 
movements.

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,120
And so that when I've done,
when I do my lectures,

29
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:50,430
when I do talks like this,
when I put them on Youtube,

30
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,490
what I'm trying to do is exactly that 
because that was the best pathway 

31
00:01:55,951 --> 00:02:00,210
forward through such things that I could
think up over 20 years of thinking about

32
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:00,300
it.

33
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,180
Um,
you know,

34
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:08,181
one is so habituated to suffering that 
they can read the Gulag archipelago,

35
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,950
which is actually quite hard to read 
without having an effect them like your 

36
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,760
psychopathic.
If that book doesn't affect you,

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,820
you know it should.
If you read it properly,

38
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,060
it affects you deeply and it's not the 
only example of that kind of literature.

39
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,060
So the people who are habituated aren't.
They've just been shown low resolution 

40
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,850
representations of things they don't 
understand that looked vaguely bad.

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,080
You don't know a damn thing about them,
and our education system has done a 

42
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,991
tremendously appalling job of educating 
young people about the absolute 

43
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:52,920
catastrophe of radical leftism.
Now it's not much better with regards to

44
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,190
say the actions of the Nazis,
although I would say on average people 

45
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,160
are more aware of that,
but they don't.

46
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,480
But it's shallow,
shallow knowledge.

47
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,170
So you make the knowledge deep and deep 
knowledge changes people and wakes them 

48
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:07,480
up.

49
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,290
You know?
I mean,

50
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,650
the only reason that I ever got 
convinced that they're that good and 

51
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,621
evil,
we're real more real than anything else 

52
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:17,350
wasn't because I learned that good was 
real.

53
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,560
That's hard.
That's hard.

54
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,650
It's hard to learn that.
You have to find examples of 

55
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:25,650
transcendent good.
You know,

56
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,460
they're rare,
evil.

57
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,100
All you have to do is look,
read history a bit and read it like it's

58
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:38,101
about you and there's no way that you 
can do that without a transformation,

59
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,940
but people won't do it.
It's like you want to imagine yourself 

60
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,030
as an Auschwitz guard.
That's a rough thing you see because you

61
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:48,670
have to figure out.
See Young said,

62
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:51,580
if you confronted the shadow,
which is the dark side of people,

63
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:53,530
the aggressive side,
the malevolent side,

64
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,860
that it.
It really reaches all the way down to 

65
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,201
hell and Dante sort of was trying to put
forward the same thing when he wrote the

66
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,800
inferno,
right?

67
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,270
With the levels of evil,
right?

68
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,460
Because it was a voyage through the 
levels of evil,

69
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,850
right to the bottom.
He thought the bottom was betrayal.

70
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,730
It's pretty good.
The most.

71
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,290
The center of malevolence is betrayal.
I liked that because to be trained,

72
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,770
someone,
you have to get them to trust you,

73
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:19,510
and trust is a moral virtue,
right?

74
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,880
Especially if it's courageous trust,
because it it.

75
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,180
It puts you in alignment with other 
people and allows you to move forward 

76
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,180
into life and if you'd be trained that 
you really,

77
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,530
it's like a knife in the.
It's like knife in the heart,

78
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:32,470
through the back,
especially if it's someone who loves,

79
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,910
loves you,
betrays you,

80
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,730
and especially if they betray you for 
your virtues.

81
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,880
That's a really nice twist.
So I believe because I think that people

82
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:48,250
are capable of good,
that if they know enough about evil that

83
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,480
that will straighten them out.

84
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,630
So,
but who wants that?

85
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,900
You know,
this is one of the things I really like 

86
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:57,900
about young.
He's often regarded as a new age thinker

87
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,540
that's wrong.
There's no new age thinker.

88
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,380
He knew that the,
the pathway to enlightenment was barred 

89
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:12,571
by the necessity of a passage through 
hell and that no one was going to do 

90
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:17,701
that.
That's why there isn't a world full of 

91
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:20,821
enlightened people.
You might say like it was just a matter 

92
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,030
of doing nice things following your 
bliss.

93
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,060
Let's say however you might put it.
Then why wouldn't everyone walk up the 

94
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,480
stairway to heaven?
That isn't how it works.

95
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:37,230
That's not how it works at all.
I don't think you can be convinced of 

96
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,640
the necessity for moral action until you
understand exactly how dark and terrible

97
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:44,641
things can get,
and then it's your fault that they're 

98
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:45,340
getting that way.
Who wants to think that?

99
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,810
So you can think it though,
but not.

100
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,400
Not Without it burning you.
