1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,530
And then of course,
by the time the child is old enough to 

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,621
be launched out into the social world,
then all the constraints that are 

3
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:10,970
associated with the playground are 
immediately placed on that child.

4
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:13,190
And that's a very unforgiving landscape,
right?

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,400
Because the last thing a child wants 
really the last thing that child wants 

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,031
is not to have any friends or even 
perhaps equally seriously not to have a 

7
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:23,710
best friend.
Huh?

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,780
Not read something so idiotic the other 
day that I couldn't believe it.

9
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:31,370
So the newest prince,
so Queen Elizabeth's,

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,460
I guess great grandchild is off to 
daycare and in the UK and in this 

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,691
daycare,
they don't let the kids have best 

12
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:40,960
friends because that's unfair.
I thought no

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,110
something times you see something that's
so stupid you can't even believe it.

14
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:46,350
It,
it,

15
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:51,470
it exists.
And that was one of those examples 

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:51,470
because it's been known for quite a long
time,

17
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,390
that one of the developmental milestones
that children attain somewhere between 

18
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:01,110
say the age of five and 10 is they pick 
a best friend.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,560
And so they.
And,

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,570
and you know the hypothesis well that's 
unfair to all the other children.

21
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:07,020
It's like,
well,

22
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,060
first of all,
you can't be the best friend to everyone

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,270
because you then maybe there is a 
billion children,

24
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:17,271
so each of them gets one second.
It's like that's just not a very deep 

25
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:20,211
relationship,
so the idea that you can be equally 

26
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:21,660
friendly with everyone is so 
preposterous,

27
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:23,790
but even worse.
The thing is the thing that the child is

28
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:28,791
doing is actually becoming.
They're stepping out of their 

29
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,620
egocentricity because they're best 
friends becomes more important than they

30
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:36,621
are,
and that's a precursor for adult 

31
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:36,621
relationships where you know if you're 
married,

32
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:39,420
while your partner should be at least as
important as you are,

33
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:41,310
and the relationship should be more 
important.

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,460
But then when you have children,
it's like they're more important than 

35
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:46,710
you that that's that.
It's unless there's something wrong with

36
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:48,610
you,
you come second in.

37
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:50,720
Your children come first and they're way
first.

38
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:55,730
They're not just a little.
I mean you're necessary because without 

39
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:55,730
you,
they're not going to manage,

40
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,330
so you have to take care of yourself,
but you're not number one anymore.

41
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:02,331
Once you have kids and less seriously,
unless you didn't learn the lessons in 

42
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,210
the playground and when you have a best 
friend,

43
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:05,910
you're not number one.
They are and so,

44
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,290
so anyways,
there are these constraints that emerge 

45
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:12,290
in the.
In the social landscape,

46
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,550
you have to have friends and also you 
have to single someone out as 

47
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,450
particularly unique among those friends 
and establish a genuinely reciprocal and

48
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:25,491
caring relationship.
I can't remember the psychiatrist who 

49
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:27,090
studied this so intently.
Unfortunately,

50
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,030
he was the first person to to do a 
detailed analysis of the best friend 

51
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,910
relationships that children established.
It's,

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,390
I'd like to give him credit for his 
ideas,

53
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,190
but unfortunately I can't remember his 
name,

54
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,420
so.
Okay.
