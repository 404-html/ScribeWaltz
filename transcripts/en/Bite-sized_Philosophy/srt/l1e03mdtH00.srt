1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,860
You remember in the Lion King,
you may not remember when,

2
00:00:03,861 --> 00:00:06,720
when,
when Mufasa,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,010
that's the king,
right?

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,730
Goes and takes Simba up to show him his 
territory.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,960
He says he is the King of everything the
light touches.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,140
And that's a very old idea and you guys 
had no problem with,

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,670
you know,
that was fine,

8
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,700
that made sense and that I will be on 
the light was the darkness.

9
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:26,640
And that was the elephant graveyard.
That was death.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,600
That was the place of death and danger.
That's where the hyenas hung out and you

11
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,490
weren't supposed to go there.
And so of course,

12
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,530
Simba,
because he's a rule breaking hero,

13
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:37,500
just like Harry Potter immediately goes 
there.

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,260
And so you know,
that's like the forbidden fruit.

15
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:44,490
It's the same sort of idea.
If you want someone to do something,

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,070
the best thing to do is tell them that 
they shouldn't and not explain why,

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:50,760
you know.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,760
So for example,
if I said to you at the beginning of 

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:55,760
this class,
look,

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,021
I've got one rule here,
don't sit in that chair no matter what 

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,860
you'd be thinking the whole year,
especially if I reminded you just what's

22
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:07,680
up with that chair.
Like that's chairs magical.

23
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,660
All of a sudden you,
some of you might even,

24
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,450
while you probably wouldn't,
because this is a ridiculous example,

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,660
but maybe you know,
you come to class early and sit in that 

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:17,670
chair just to see what would happen.
You know,

27
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:20,790
and people are very curious and that's 
exactly what we're like.

28
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,010
And that's a very old story too,
right?

29
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:25,920
It's like opening Pandora's box.
Don't open that box.

30
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:26,940
You'll be sorry.
It's like,

31
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:28,260
oh,
you know,

32
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:31,800
all of the horrors of the world fly out.
Believe me,

33
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,170
you will open Pandora's box many times 
in your life because you know,

34
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,790
with your family or maybe your mate or 
maybe your children,

35
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,270
you'll have this idea that they have a 
box with things in it that you want to 

36
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,550
know about.

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,660
And you'll say,
well,

38
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:51,780
I'm kind of curious about this 
particular event,

39
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:53,820
so why don't you tell me about it?
And they say,

40
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:58,821
well no,
we probably really shouldn't open that 

41
00:01:58,821 --> 00:02:01,341
box and you keep bugging him and then 
they open it and then all sorts of 

42
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:03,420
things fly out that you didn't expect 
and then maybe you think,

43
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,450
hey,
it would have been better if I would 

44
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:08,450
have just left that damn box closed,
but,

45
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,020
and you can do the same thing to 
yourself,

46
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,110
believe me.
And so the Pandora's box idea,

47
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:14,850
the forbidden fruit idea,
that's,

48
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,310
that's a major league idea.
And part of the reason in the Judeo 

49
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,110
Christian tradition,
why people are saddled with the notion 

50
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,841
of original sin is because hyper 
cortically developed chimpanzees without

51
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:31,380
much sense.
Can't keep their hands off things.

52
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,650
And so they keep exploring even when 
they know better and every time they do 

53
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:41,010
that,
they learned something that is,

54
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,850
that destroys the paradise that they 
currently inhabit.

55
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,410
Right?
Because there's plenty.

56
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,560
You and I never learned anything in your
life that's of importance without it 

57
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,420
having a pretty damn destabilizing 
effect on you at the moment of 

58
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:56,420
realization,
right?

59
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,310
You learn something happy.
It's like whatever.

60
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,250
You know that all that means is that I 
was doing things right,

61
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,680
like it's nice and everything,
but it's not informative.

62
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,660
You do something and all hell breaks 
loose.

63
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,500
That'll make you think.
Now it's for sure.

64
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,960
You might never stop thinking for the 
rest of your life.
