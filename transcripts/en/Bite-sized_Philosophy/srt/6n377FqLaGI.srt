1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,380
You know if you listen to a complex 
piece of music or at least this is my 

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,570
experience with complex music is 
sometimes the first time I hear it.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,050
I don't really like it and I don't I 
don't.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,090
I think I also don't understand it.
I actually can't hear it.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,610
You know maybe a musical genius could 
hear the whole thing instantly you know 

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,670
say Franz Liszt.
They say he could sight read anything on

7
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:25,671
the piano first try.
So you know some people are so 

8
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:30,171
intelligent musically that it's 
incomprehensible and I'm sure they hear 

9
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:33,591
things just fine the first time they 
hear them but then what happens for me 

10
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:35,670
is that if I listen to it a couple more 
times there are pieces chunks of it that

11
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:37,530
start to fall into place that I can 
follow.

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,690
And you know I can see the beauty sort 
of shining through those and then 

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,530
eventually the whole thing.

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,130
Leaks together and then I can listen to 
it especially if it's a complete black 

15
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,280
piece of music.
Many many many times.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,070
And the more complex and probably the 
better.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,100
The piece of music the more I can listen
to it but if I listen to it enough at 

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,700
some point then I've had enough of it 
and it's all very strange phenomena.

19
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,790
Because one of the things you might ask 
yourself is What exactly are you 

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,431
learning while you're doing that.
You're you know it seems like you want 

21
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:10,890
the music it's something like you want 
the music to be.

22
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,150
Just exactly the right amount of 
predictable and unpredictable and if 

23
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,450
it's too unpredictable then you can't 
understand it and if it's too 

24
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,110
predictable it's boring and so it's just
like a conversation not way.

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,360
It's actually just like life as well.
Because you want things to be 

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,170
predictable and stable.
And you want things to be unpredictable 

27
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,760
and interesting.
And the degree to which you want each of

28
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:35,460
those is going to depend on the time and
the context.

29
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,090
And also on your own intelligence and 
temperament.

30
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,410
So.

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,530
Now I'm going to.
Tell you a bunch of stories and give you

32
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:48,960
a bunch of a number of pieces of 
information and.

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,740
Hopefully they'll click together.
Now I think the reason that this 

34
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,641
information is always being transmitted 
in story in image form is because it's 

35
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:02,391
very very difficult to transform it into
articulated into fully articulated 

36
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,130
explanation.
It isn't really how it works.

37
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,560
No we're not really accustomed to 
thinking about the idea that there are 

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,731
certain forms of information that.
And that that are valid forms of 

39
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:15,540
information that can't be transmitted 
verbally.

40
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,710
Of course if you think about it we all 
understand this deeply because while I 

41
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,171
can give you a bunch of examples the 
first example is that when you speak not

42
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:29,610
only do you speak in words and phrases 
in sentences and paragraphs but you also

43
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:34,611
speak melodically and in fact part of 
the reason that you can understand 

44
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:39,201
melodies and that they make sense to you
is that what artists have done is 

45
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:43,701
separated the melodic element of speech 
from the semantic element and then 

46
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:48,921
played with the melodic element and the 
melodic element tends to carry a lot of 

47
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:50,890
emotion and intent and soul.

48
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,360
If you're listening to someone speak you
can tell when they're being ironic you 

49
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,730
know because they raised an eyebrow and 
their voice changes slightly even though

50
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:03,360
they might be using in fact they are 
using exactly the same words and in fact

51
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:08,361
someone who's very good at being witty 
or ironic will set the situation up so 

52
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:10,440
that you can barely tell that they're 
joking.

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,880
And the better they are at that the.
Time of year that they give you that you

54
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:18,870
can still catch onto the funny or the 
situation is so.

55
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,500
So we know that the information can be 
transmitted through non-verbal channels 

56
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,611
if it even happens during speech.
And then of course we understand that 

57
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:35,031
music.
Presents to us an intimation of meaning 

58
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:40,011
that's very difficult to fully grasp.
And music for me has always been a 

59
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,140
ineffable phenomenon in some sense 
because.

60
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,460
It carries the intimation of meaning in 
a manner that can't be rationally 

61
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,980
dismissed or that people are interested 
in rationally dismissing.

62
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,040
So even punk rock nihilists listen to 
punk rock nihilistic music and they know

63
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,740
they find that meaningful even though 
they don't believe in meaning.

64
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,820
And you know in some sense they're 
victims of their own rationality because

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
they do believe in meaning or they 
wouldn't be listening to the music but 

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,630
they can't understand how they could 
possibly believe in it so their rational

67
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:17,631
mind has dispensed with the idea.
And sometimes that's people dispense 

68
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:21,801
with the idea of meaning for lots of 
reasons partly because of because it's 

69
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:26,271
inevitable in some sense with sufficient
rationality but also because because 

70
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:28,350
it's always useful to look.
For the.

71
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,090
Underbelly of things because it also 
justifies not bearing any responsibility

72
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:38,091
for your life and not fairly.
What that can be a very desirable side 

73
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:41,850
effect of a particular ideological 
irrational belief.

74
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,320
And then there's dance of course and 
dance is even more ineffable.

75
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,500
The music although it's often paired 
with music you know when it's and it it 

76
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,470
grips people if you see a remarkable 
dance performance.

77
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:00,010
Well part of it is that you're sort of 
thrilled and excited about seeing just 

78
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,921
exactly what the human form can do.
Because perhaps partly because you're 

79
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:08,391
human and when you see someone extending
a certain ability far beyond the norm 

80
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,260
then it expands your sense of what a 
human being is capable of.

81
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:18,290
So there so there's that there's just 
the pure steel element and then there's 

82
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,591
the novelty element because often if you
watch a particularly good dancer there's

83
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:25,110
things they do that you haven't seen 
before that you didn't know anyone could

84
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:28,200
do and that's pretty fun and then often 
the dances.

85
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,780
Is joined with the music and the body is
expressing what the music means and even

86
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:38,781
though you can't tell what the music 
means you can tell that that dance is 

87
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:38,781
expressing.

88
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:43,060
And see I think what happens there is 
that music represents the patterns of 

89
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:48,351
being.
It's actually because people think of 

90
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:48,351
music as a Non-representational art but 
I think that's wrong.

91
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:53,180
I think it might be the most 
representational art is that being is 

92
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,691
made up of layers of patterned layers of
patterns constantly interaction 

93
00:05:56,691 --> 00:06:00,600
interacting and hopefully in a 
relatively harmonious way and music.

94
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,260
Music demonstrates that mimics that in 
some sense abstractly and then the dance

95
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:11,721
is an abstract representation like 
people adapt to the patterns of being 

96
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:16,250
and the dancer adapts to the pattern of 
music and so it's symbolic it's an 

97
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:21,040
embodied display of the place of the 
person in the cosmos.

98
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,270
And you can you can also make that case 
when you see people dancing in pairs 

99
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,170
because you can dance alone or you can 
dance in pairs and that's basically 

100
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,170
standard human adaptation.

101
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,020
And music is interesting too because one
of the things that you'll notice is that

102
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:42,021
there's always music in a movie almost 
always there's the movie that doesn't 

103
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:46,571
have it's quite marked.
When it's absent you know the movie 

104
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:47,970
feels a lot more cold and clinical 
although it can work.

105
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,440
But we accept the idea that music can be
used to fill in the missing context in a

106
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,730
movie without even ever questioning it.
Right.

107
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,770
Like it's very strange if you think 
about it that you go to a movie that is 

108
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,841
doing at least at least part of its 
function is to portray reality in a 

109
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:09,221
realistic way.
But there's a soundtrack playing in the 

110
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:09,560
background all the time and you don't 
know it.

111
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,740
It's so useful and so appropriate that 
you don't notice how strange it is that 

112
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,640
that's OK.
