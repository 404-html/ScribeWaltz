1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,530
And human beings,
our principal made in the image of that 

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,421
logos and that's why we can speak things
into being and we do,

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,930
and when you speak truth,
then you speak paradise into being and 

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,570
when you speak falsely,
you speak.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,590
Helen's being and that's the truth,
and what that means is that with every 

6
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:27,580
decision that you make,
you decide for yourself and for everyone

7
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:29,350
else,
whether you're going to tilt the world a

8
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:32,740
little bit more towards hell or a little
bit more towards heaven,

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,730
and that's the burden you bear for your 
existence and the choices that you make 

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,820
as you pass through life.
And it's the fleeing from that.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,520
That's at the bottom of the nihilism of 
postmodernism and the escaped into the 

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,060
totalitarian certainties of idol 
worship.

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,730
And none of this is fictional because 
we've seen the consequences.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Jonathan said quoting,
I don't remember the source,

15
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,350
that there could be no poetry after 
Auschwitz,

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,340
but that's wrong,
but the poetry has to be about 

17
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,370
Auschwitz.
The lesson for Marsh,

18
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:26,400
which was never again and fair enough,
but

19
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,930
you.
You can't

20
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,940
decide not to repeat something terrible 
unless you understand it,

21
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,700
and the way to understand it is that the
smallest things of each individual 

22
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,650
culminate in a great sense of the state,
and so when you ask why terrible things 

23
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:53,020
happened in the world,
the answer is quite simple.

24
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,740
The answer is because you're not good 
enough and it's because you don't tell 

25
00:01:59,111 --> 00:01:59,710
the truth

26
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,270
and you know it.

27
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,700
Jonathan said something I thought was 
very interesting.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's something I've thought about,
but I haven't talked to him about it at 

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
all.

30
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,910
What happens as you move towards the 
truth and the answer is everything comes

31
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:17,170
together.
It really,

32
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,270
really is.
The answer is everything comes together.

33
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,790
There's even a sexual element to that 
because of course,

34
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:26,791
the highest element of sexual ecstasy is
to come together and around someone 

35
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:31,870
who's telling the truth.
Everything comes together and that's the

36
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:33,280
potential guests.
One of the world.

37
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:36,970
It's something that you can partake in.
It's the calls.

38
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,910
It's the call to the greatest adventure 
that there is.

39
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,570
You can bring forth something akin to 
paradise by speaking the truth and you 

40
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,090
can start in your own life and you can 
start in,

41
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,540
in,
in the life of your own families,

42
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:54,541
and these are people in principle that 
you love and so why would you do 

43
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,430
anything to speak the truth to them,
to protect them from reality?

44
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,940
There's no protecting from reality.
Reality just is you interact with it on 

45
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:09,430
your terms.
Can you do that?

46
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,450
My face get forthright and you do that 
by not shying away from the challenge.

47
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,220
I spent a lot of time trying to 
understand the sermon on the mount.

48
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,910
It's a very strange document.
I'm going to tell you what I think it 

49
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,910
means.

50
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,550
It means conceptualize the highest good 
that you town and so you might think 

51
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,310
that would be the highest good for you 
and it would be the highest good for the

52
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:41,311
family around you that you love and it 
would be the highest good that sound 

53
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:44,741
like in the state and it would be the 
highest good for the state in the world 

54
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:44,920
and that would be the highest possible.
Good.

55
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,770
Even though even though you don't know 
how to that,

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,800
make that what you want and then tell 
the truth and it's an adventure because 

57
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:59,791
you don't know what's going to happen.
You have no idea because if you treat 

58
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:00,880
things instrumental,
if you treat people instrumental,

59
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:04,090
you use them as tools for your own 
desire and not.

60
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:07,570
The problem with that is what do you 
know about what you designed?

61
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,960
Many things that you chase will turn out
to be empty.

62
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,750
Well,
what happens if you just tell the truth?

63
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,210
Well,
the world will unfold around you in very

64
00:04:17,211 --> 00:04:22,211
strange and mysterious ways and there 
isn't anything that's more exciting to 

65
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:25,731
now and it's perhaps something excited 
me enough so that suffering that's 

66
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:28,790
attendant on being would redeem itself.
Why that adventure,

67
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,540
and that's the call,
that's the western call to the 

68
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,631
individual,
is suffering of being can redeem itself 

69
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:37,930
through truth and it's not.
It's,

70
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,180
it's not a rule.
It's not a proposition that you need to 

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,820
adhere to like a good citizen.
It's,

72
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,080
it's the proper way of winning your way 
through the terrible world without 

73
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,450
making it worse than it already is.
But the possibility perhaps of making it

74
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,480
better,
there's no more exciting possibility to 

75
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,721
not a no higher moral demand.
The thing is is everyone knows that you 

76
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:07,160
know when you lie according to your own 
conception of the truth,

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,240
that there is some sheet,
something shameful and demeaning about 

78
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,640
that and know that it hurts people and 
you think,

79
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:16,350
well,
why do you do it despite all of that,

80
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:21,351
in part because it's easy and partly the
you do it because there's a crooked,

81
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,100
horrible,
hellish part of your soul that's more 

82
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,120
than happy if part of what you do is 
make everything worse.

83
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,650
The page for the sin of its existence.
