1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,870
My,
my nephew had a dream at one point,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,860
this little,
someone made a little animated thing out

3
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:09,990
of it and put it on the intranet,
which is quite cool.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,280
So anyways,
he,

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,340
he,
he was having night terrors and he ran 

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:16,340
around like a little night,
uh,

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:16,550
you know,
Kai,

8
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,050
a Connecticut,
k n I g h t night,

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,150
and he had little,
you know,

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,630
armor and a sword and he run around the 
house with little hat on being the night

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,110
and he was only like four or something.
And he'd watched this lot of Disney 

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,110
movies,
lot of movies.

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,261
So he kinda got the night idea was it 
was at his acting that out and he was 

14
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:37,510
having these terrors at night,
right.

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,080
So He'd go to bed with his little hat 
and his sword and he put them on is bad.

16
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:44,280
And then at night he'd wake up 
screaming.

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,760
And that happened for a very long time.
And so when I went to visit,

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,240
uh,
you know,

19
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:51,780
I found out that this was happening and 
he had a night terror.

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,530
So the kid wakes up with night terrors 
screaming but can't remember anything.

21
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:58,350
Generally speaking.
So anyways,

22
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:03,351
this was happening and so it happened 
one day and I was sitting with him and 

23
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:04,230
his family at the,
at the breakfast table,

24
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,120
and I said,
uh,

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,410
did you,
did he have a dream?

26
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:08,490
And he said,
Oh yes,

27
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:09,810
I had a dream.
I said,

28
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:10,410
well,
you know,

29
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,520
what was your dream?
And He,

30
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,690
and he said,
well,

31
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:15,350
I was out on this field and,
and,

32
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,440
and I was surrounded by these dwarfs.
And they came up to my knees and they 

33
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:20,910
were,
they didn't have any arms,

34
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:25,911
they had big feet and they were covered 
with hair and there was a cross shaved 

35
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:27,990
at the top of their head and they were 
all greasy and they had huge beaks.

36
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:33,230
And everywhere I went they jumped at me 
with their beaks and there was lots of 

37
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,861
them and everybody was very quiet after 
he said this because it was like that,

38
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,390
oh,
that's why you're screaming at night.

39
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,290
It's like,
yeah,

40
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,910
okay.
And so,

41
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,420
so,
and,

42
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,760
and,
and then he said,

43
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:47,250
but,
but at the background there was a dragon

44
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:51,270
and the dragon would blow out smoke and 
fire and then it would turn into these.

45
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,830
Dwarfs,
so it's like,

46
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:54,240
man,
that kid had a problem,

47
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:54,960
right?
It was like,

48
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,920
well,
what are you going to do?

49
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:57,630
We fight off a dwarf.
Who Cares?

50
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,660
It's like plus 10 more.
That's life,

51
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:02,220
man.
That's life.

52
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,260
Really.
That's the Hydra.

53
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,630
You cut off one head,
seven more grow.

54
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:10,140
That's life snakes everywhere and you 
get rid of one,

55
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,410
there'll be more.
And so he figured that out.

56
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,290
It's a hell of an existential shock when
you're four.

57
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,060
And so he's like,
he's a knight.

58
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,090
He's thinking,
what do I do about these dwarfs while 

59
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,090
there's too many of them,
but there's a dragon also.

60
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,550
I said,
well,

61
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,670
what could you do about that?
Right.

62
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,730
Loaded question.
It implies that you could do something 

63
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,130
about that.
Well,

64
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:37,131
he kind of knew that,
which is why he was running around like 

65
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:37,131
a night,
you know,

66
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:38,280
he kind of figured that out and he said,
well,

67
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:43,281
I get my dad and I jump up on the dragon
and I poke out both of its size with my 

68
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:43,800
sword,
and then I go right down.

69
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:46,410
It's stomach to the place where the fire
came out,

70
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,730
the firebox and then I carve a piece of 
the firebox Oh,

71
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:52,770
did I make a shield?
And that would be the end of that.

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,330
And I thought,
wow,

73
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,020
good work kid.
Like you really got it right.

74
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,730
It's the,
it's the central human story.

75
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,520
There's the terrible unknown,
right?

76
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,700
Fire-Breathing generating trouble.
And what do you do?

77
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:11,701
You confront that,
you confront that and by confronting it 

78
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:13,060
you get stronger.
That's the shield and that's,

79
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,850
that's what a human being is.
And that's,

80
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,190
that's right.
It's exactly right.

81
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,200
And that was the end of his night 
terrors by the way,

82
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:25,201
which seems too good to be true,
but it is actually true because I 

83
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:28,561
followed up with his mother for a long 
time and that was that he catalyze that 

84
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:32,521
part of his identity.
He adopted the role of the mythological 

85
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:34,710
hero and that's what he needed to do 
because like there was lots of drag.

86
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,460
There's a dragon and a bunch of gifts,
like,

87
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,260
what the hell are you going to do about 
that run?

88
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,500
That's not gonna help.
You know,

89
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,540
if you run in a dream like that,
the doors multiply and they get bigger 

90
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,740
and you get smaller as you run.
It's like that's not a good.

91
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,360
That is not a good solution.
And people do that in their life all the

92
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:57,361
time and so the dwarves get bigger until
they're giants and they get smaller 

93
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:02,251
until there's nothing left of them and 
then then there's no recovery.

94
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,480
That is not good.
