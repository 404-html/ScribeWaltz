1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,020
So in the second volume of Harry Potter,
correct me if I have any of these 

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,020
details,
rog.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,150
You remember?
There's that snake,

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,540
the bast lisc.
So this is magic castle,

5
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,700
right?
You guys have no problem with that magic

6
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:12,810
castle.
No problem.

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,820
There's a north,
he's an orphan.

8
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:18,570
He goes to the magic castle to learn how
to be more than normal,

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,680
right?
The muggles,

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,770
he has a muggle family,
were not too happy with the muggle 

11
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,441
family,
like as representatives of normal 

12
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:27,441
people.
They,

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,040
they have some blacks now.
Of course,

14
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,450
the reason for that is that,
well,

15
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:32,730
that's what teenagers often feel about 
their parents,

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,140
right?
They failed Jesus.

17
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:39,141
These couldn't really be my parents.
I must have some other parents who were 

18
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:41,550
like together knows it,
like magical parents,

19
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:43,710
right?
Parents that live in the sky.

20
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:46,290
And of course Harry Potter has earthly 
parents.

21
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,830
That's the muggles.
And Dursley I think is the kid.

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,820
He's a one.
He's a wonderful piece of work and uh,

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,220
you know,
ill formed day,

24
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,110
spoiled,
ill formed,

25
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:02,250
selfish very far from the ideal.
He's a foil for Harry.

26
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,740
And of course he's appreciated and doted
on.

27
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,680
And Harry is actually punished for his 
virtues.

28
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,360
Lots of classic story,
right?

29
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,960
To be punished for your virtues.
I mean if you look at the story,

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,260
the central story in Christianity,
the central story in Christianity is 

31
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,161
about someone who is precisely punished 
in the worst possible way for the 

32
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:25,611
highest possible virtues.
That's what it makes it an archetypal 

33
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:26,460
story because there isn't anything more 
unfair than that.

34
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,480
And so it's a limit in a sense.
You can't be worse than that.

35
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,430
Being punished for being,
you know,

36
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:33,480
unworthy.
It's like,

37
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:33,880
yeah,
yeah,

38
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:38,160
I will at least make sense,
but to be punished because you have your

39
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:39,810
act together and you're a good person.

40
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,530
That's real punishment.
And that's what happens to Harry.

41
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,010
So luckily he finds out that he's 
magical,

42
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,070
which is quite convenient.
And off he goes to wizarding school and 

43
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,220
you know,
that's actually like taking.

44
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,970
That's actually like going and studying 
the humanities.

45
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,260
I mean it was when they still were.
No,

46
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,780
because it's through the humanities that
you,

47
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,380
that you make contact with the magic of 
your culture and that makes you more 

48
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:17,511
than merely the child of your parents 
because you are more than merely the 

49
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:21,891
child of your parents.
You're the child of nature and you're 

50
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,741
the child of culture,
and until you understand what that 

51
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:29,451
means,
understand that you have two sets of 

52
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:29,451
parents,
like the divine hero always has two sets

53
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:34,341
of parents.
You can't construe yourself properly as 

54
00:02:34,341 --> 00:02:39,231
an individual.
You're not situated properly in the 

55
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:41,871
world.
You don't know what your 

56
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,431
responsibilities are.
You can't orient your values properly 

57
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:46,170
and you will suffer for that because as 
far as I can tell,

58
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,010
because life is so difficult,
you have to do something that's truly 

59
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:57,651
worthwhile in order to justify it,
and so while that's what these stories 

60
00:02:59,691 --> 00:03:04,691
tell you,
that's what the story of Jonah is 

61
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:06,281
telling you.
It's like you have an ethical duty to 

62
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:08,750
straighten things up and if you don't do
it,

63
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,730
you're going to be story.

64
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,900
And that story is echoed everywhere.
Well now,

65
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:16,490
St George.
Well,

66
00:03:16,491 --> 00:03:18,890
let's go to Harry Potter.
That's what we were talking about.

67
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,060
So he goes off to the magic castle and 
uh,

68
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,510
he's learning to be a wizard and he's 
kind of an interesting character because

69
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,930
he's not really good and we find out 
what I think that's because it doesn't 

70
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,920
have a piece of Volta,
Marty and um,

71
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,740
he's not what happens.
Yeah.

72
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,390
And that's what that means is that to be
good,

73
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,320
truly good,
you kind of just follow rules that's 

74
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,380
very clear in the Harry Potter story and
you also have to be able to understand 

75
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,611
malevolence and in order to understand 
malevolence so that you can withstand 

76
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:58,721
it,
you have to understand that part of you 

77
00:03:58,721 --> 00:03:59,210
that's malevolent because if you don't,
you're naive.

78
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,880
If you're naive,
you're easy pickings.

79
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,750
And so that's a union idea too.
And the union idea is that part of 

80
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,801
personality development is to understand
your shadow and the shadow is those 

81
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:15,200
things about you that you do not want to
admit to.

82
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:16,880
And

83
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,560
you can learn about your shadow by 
reading history.

84
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,870
You know,
you can read about Auschwitz,

85
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,410
you can read about the concentration 
camps in Russia and you can imagine 

86
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,881
yourself as a guard instead of as a 
heroic rescue or unfortunate victims,

87
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:41,941
which would be very,
very unlikely and once you can imagine 

88
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:45,100
yourself as a guard,
which is a terrifying thing to do,

89
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,990
then you understand something about 
yourself.

90
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,160
And I actually think,
and I think this is also from student 

91
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,931
studying young,
that you cannot have proper respect for 

92
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,581
yourself until you know that you're a 
monster because you won't act carefully 

93
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:03,040
enough.
You know,

94
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,610
if you think,
well,

95
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:05,710
I'm a nice person.
I'd never do anyone any harm.

96
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:06,790
It's like,
you know,

97
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:11,140
St you can be sure of that and the harm 
that you do.

98
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:16,141
People can come in many,
many ways and so if you regard yourself 

99
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:18,190
as harmless,
inoffensive,

100
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,240
nice.

101
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,110
Well Marty,
you have any reason to be careful.

102
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,690
You're like a teddy bear sitting on a 
shelf.

103
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,480
Even if you throw it at someone,
no one's going to get hurt,

104
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,840
but that isn't what you're like because 
you're a human being and human beings 

105
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,661
are some vicious creatures and there's 
utility in knowing that because it's 

106
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:40,010
also the case.
You know,

107
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,280
when the Harry Potter series,
Harry could stand up against voldemort 

108
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,941
and understand them and speak his 
language because he was infected by him 

109
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:48,460
to some degree.
Very,

110
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:50,380
very interesting idea.
Anyways,

111
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,350
in the second 10,
the reason I'm telling you this,

112
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,500
and this is where thinking about,
it's like how long were each of those 

113
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,621
books?
Like 500 pages long and there was how 

114
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:06,740
many of them?
Seven and how many of them were sold.

115
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,280
I mean,
how many of you read every Harry Potter 

116
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,280
book,

117
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,610
right?
Absolutely.

118
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,500
How many of you read at least one?
Okay.

119
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:21,130
How many of you saw the movies?
It's like you're all in a cult.

120
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,550
You are.
I'm telling you.

121
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,750
Really,
that's the truth.

122
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,430
It's really the truth.
So in the second volume,

123
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,930
there's this snake that zipping around 
there,

124
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:32,860
the Basilisk,
right?

125
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:36,430
And it lives in the underground.
That's chaos.

126
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,060
That's chaos.
And that's because wherever you are,

127
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,030
you're on thin ice and underneath your 
thin ice is chaos.

128
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,240
And here we are in this unbelievably 
civilized environment and everyone's 

129
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,530
getting along so perfectly.
But you know,

130
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,780
we've got hot,
we've got lights,

131
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:55,600
we've got electricity,
sewage system is working,

132
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,470
no one's hungry.
It's like we can be peaceful,

133
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,460
but if any of that fell apart and it 
could easily fall apart because it's a 

134
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,941
bloody miracle it ever works at all,
then the chaos that's just underneath 

135
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:12,250
the surface is going to come up and 
right now.

136
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,900
And it's useful to know that because it 
makes you properly grateful.

137
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,990
If you really understand it,
it makes you properly grateful for the 

138
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,430
bloody miracle it is that you can be 
here in peace.

139
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,790
So anyways,
there's this snake that's underneath the

140
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:32,530
surface and it's no joke that thing.
It's big and it's ancient.

141
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:35,500
It's always been there.
And what happens if you look at it,

142
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,110
it turns you to stone,
right?

143
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,550
It paralyzes you.
Well,

144
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:43,200
that's the,
that's the Gorgon,

145
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:46,770
that's Medusa.
The woman with the head of snakes.

146
00:07:46,771 --> 00:07:48,780
And if you look at her,
it paralyzes you.

147
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,850
What does that mean?
Well,

148
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,180
you're walking through the jungle and 
big snake appears.

149
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,390
What do you do?
You freeze and no bloody wonder because 

150
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,070
you're a prey animal and that's what 
they do when they see things that are 

151
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,210
going to eat them,
and so the snake,

152
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,020
well,
lots of people still die from snakebite 

153
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,980
and our ancestors were our ancestors 
like you know,

154
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,200
tens of millions of years ago when they 
were living in trees and weren't very 

155
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,531
big,
they made a nice snack for a snake and 

156
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:27,411
there's a woman named Lynn Isabelle,
who's an anthropologist at Ucla who's 

157
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:31,371
correlated the presence of carnivorous 
snakes with the acuity of primate 

158
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:37,191
vision.
And what she found was that the more 

159
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:37,440
snakes around the better the primates 
could see.

160
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:43,790
So and we're particularly good at 
picking up patterns like snake 

161
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,780
camouflage in the lower half of our 
visual quadrant.

162
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,880
You know,
when people generally don't like snakes,

163
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:50,610
you can learn to handle them,
but no snake.

164
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Fear appears to be innate.
It's innate in chimpanzees and it tends 

165
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,090
to increase as you age than decreasing.
You can overcome it,

166
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,620
but.
Well,

167
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,410
my daughter had snakes and one day her 
sneak bitter.

168
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,610
It was a fairly big snake

169
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,860
and she hadn't paid attention to it for 
awhile.

170
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,950
So it nailed her.
And from then on she had had very 

171
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,751
difficult time grabbing the snake,
bitten once shy permanently.

172
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,950
She also told me years later she had 
nightmares about snakes all the time 

173
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,090
when she had a snake in her room.
It's like,

174
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,500
you know,
and I think it was probably the smell.

175
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,040
So anyways,
so Harry Potter decides he's going to go

176
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:38,441
after the basilisk Greg,
he's going to go out there and face the 

177
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:38,780
thing that he's most afraid of.
So he does that.

178
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,680
Weighed out in the depths.
So it's like Jonah going down into the 

179
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,251
depths and he faces the basilisk and it 
bites him and you know,

180
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:50,660
that's uh,
that's right.

181
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:55,070
Because if you go down into the depths,
you can get bitten.

182
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,070
Like it's no joke,
and this is a hero story,

183
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:00,620
but the thing about the hero stories,
it's actually real.

184
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:03,260
The thing that you're facing is actually
dangerous.

185
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,470
And even though facing it voluntarily 
might be your best bet and is likely 

186
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:13,601
your best bet,
because that's the central story of 

187
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,611
humanity,
that doesn't mean you're going to 

188
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:15,611
succeed.
It's the real thing.

189
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:16,160
So anyways,
he gets bitten,

190
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,350
right?
And he's going to die.

191
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,160
Now he's rescuing Jenny.
So that's the St George Story.

192
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:27,050
If you go after like dragon dragons,
like to capture virgins,

193
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,280
God only knows why I think it's because

194
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,590
I think it's because one of the things 
that male humans have done from the 

195
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,090
beginning of time is chase the damn 
predators away.

196
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,140
And I suspect that the males from God 
only knows how long ago who were 

197
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:58,011
particularly good at that we're rewarded
with female attention.

198
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:03,411
And why the hell not so?
It's deeply rooted inside of us.

199
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:07,320
That idea of facing the unknown and 
freeing the woman.

200
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,310
So the idea there is that if you.
It's a male idea,

201
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:15,311
and in large part I can talk about the 
central female myth and I will as we 

202
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:20,271
proceed.
The idea is that if you're the sort of 

203
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:23,610
person who can stand up against the 
unknown and the frightening,

204
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,420
then you're also likely if you develop 
into that sort of person,

205
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:32,421
then you're also likely to develop into 
the sort of person that other people 

206
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:34,890
will find attractive.
So you know,

207
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:38,520
and that's why young believed that the 
inside the shadow was the anima,

208
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,170
which is like a female figure.

209
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,410
And so his idea was something like,
you know,

210
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,530
if you look watch movies,
there's always this Beta male guy,

211
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:52,070
if they're romantic movies and he's a 
nice guy and he's the friend and you 

212
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,391
know,
the woman tells them everything but she 

213
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:55,930
doesn't like him a bit.
She likes the guy who's like got an edge

214
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,270
and who's capable of,
I would say mayhem,

215
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,920
but at least have aggression.
Now,

216
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,810
that doesn't mean she wants him to be 
aggressive,

217
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:08,140
but what it does mean is that she wants 
him to be able to be aggressive.

218
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:13,530
That would be good.
And so he's the romantic target and so 

219
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,011
he's the person that's incorporating the
shadow and he's someone that is 

220
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:19,870
respectable and perhaps useful.
And so.

221
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,880
Well,
that's a very old story,

222
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,050
so let's,
let's think about this for a minute.

223
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,410
I've already offered you a proposition 
and I think it's an important 

224
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,001
proposition and I'm offering you this 
proposition so that you can make sense 

225
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:53,131
of art and literature and mythology and 
religion and dance and all those strange

226
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,020
ritualistic things that human beings do,
which seems central to us,

227
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:04,021
including including not least,
the ineradicable tendency of us to seek 

228
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:12,091
out stories of heroes.
I should finish the Harry Potter story.

229
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:18,040
So Harry Potter goes down there to 
rescue Virginia.

230
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,730
No,
it's,

231
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,430
that's not her name.
What is it,

232
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,170
Jenny?
Yeah,

233
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,540
but there's a,
there's a formal name for that.

234
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,200
It's a variant of Virginia anyways,
which is very divergent.

235
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:30,610
So,
um,

236
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,270
and he gets bitten.
Jen.

237
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,090
Yes.
Ginevra.

238
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:37,420
That's it.
He gets bitten and the bite is poisonous

239
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,980
and so there is dying,
which doesn't seem to be so good.

240
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,630
And then what happens?

241
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,130
And again,
you guys swallowed this.

242
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:48,250
It's no problem.
So what's his name?

243
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:51,160
The dumbledore character.
He's got a bird,

244
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,830
right?
So he's the wise old man.

245
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:57,220
He's the ruler of the castle.
He's the ruler of the magic castle.

246
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,980
He's the magic king,
you know,

247
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,190
he's like,
God the father as far as Harry Potter is

248
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:04,810
concerned,
and he has a bird.

249
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,750
What kind of bird is it?
It's a phoenix.

250
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:12,751
Right?
And one of the things that's very 

251
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,290
strange about a phoenix is that while 
it's a mortal but in a strange way,

252
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,180
you know,
it lives and lives,

253
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:19,270
I think 100 years and it gets older and 
older and then one day poof,

254
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:24,160
it burst into flames and turns into an 
egg and then you get a new phoenix.

255
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,440
So that's a symbol of transformation.
It's a symbol of transformation.

256
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,620
The bird is a spirit or psyche,
and so here's what it means in part,

257
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,770
you know,
you know how when you learn a lesson in 

258
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,430
your life that that's not very pleasant,
right?

259
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,890
It's not like when you learn something 
important,

260
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,640
it's the best day of your life.
It's often the importance of what you 

261
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:54,830
learn is often proportionate to just how
ratcheted it is to learn it.

262
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,870
You know,
you learn things the hard way.

263
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:02,110
You learn things by getting hit because 
obviously if what you're doing is 

264
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,500
working,
you get what you want.

265
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,020
There's no learning in that and that's 
happy.

266
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,230
It's when you're doing something and you
hit an obstacle and maybe a bloody well 

267
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,840
hit it hard and then you know you recoil
and then you down into the depths you go

268
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:17,440
and you have to sort yourself out and he
realized that you're,

269
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,640
you know,
this particular kind of idiot and that 

270
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,000
you should probably fix that and that's 
really annoying and difficult and you 

271
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,721
know,
and maybe you're down in the dumps and 

272
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:31,061
anxious for quite a while and then you 
get it repaired more or less than you 

273
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:31,061
know,
you put yourself back together.

274
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,250
That's the Phoenix poof into flames.
Bang Egg knew you.

275
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,450
And so you know,
that's the ability to learn.

276
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,510
Human beings are very strange creatures,
right?

277
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,950
Because we're very malleable compared to
most animals,

278
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,820
like grizzly bears now in grizzly bears 
a thousand years ago.

279
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:55,460
It's like whatever.
They are the same thing.

280
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,760
They do the same thing.
There was no transformation about human 

281
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,920
beings.
We have this massive brain and you know,

282
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:08,921
it's a pain because it means you have to
take care of human children until 

283
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:12,701
they're 40 and that's a big burden and 
so,

284
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:14,570
you know,
we pay a big price for it.

285
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:17,540
It also makes childbirth very difficult 
and uh,

286
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,360
and it's costly.
You have to eat a lot because you have a

287
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:23,270
big brain because it uses up a lot of 
energy and so,

288
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,730
you know,
you pay a price for it,

289
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:29,030
but the advantages your plastic you can 
learn.

290
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,750
Now learning is a strange thing because 
you can think of it as just acquiring 

291
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:40,511
more information,
but you could also think of it and this 

292
00:16:40,511 --> 00:16:44,621
is more accurate as finding out 
something that you're doing wrong.

293
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,150
So that sort of built into you like a 
character,

294
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,820
a character element of your character,
of presumption,

295
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:53,150
of your perception or a deep habit.
It's really built into you.

296
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,830
It's a neural structure,
right?

297
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,490
It's little,
it's alive and you have to kill it 

298
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,110
because he's working properly.
And the pain that you go through in part

299
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,300
when you're suffering because you did 
something stupid.

300
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:08,450
Is it something like your,
your,

301
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,650
the neurology,
I can never get this quite right.

302
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,400
It's the pain of the death of that 
structure and that can be a huge chunk 

303
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,010
of you.
You know,

304
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:24,011
if,
if you really have to go through a 

305
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:26,140
massive revision,
it's like the person that comes out the 

306
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,560
other end might hardly be the same at 
all.

307
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,060
You know?
That happens.

308
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:31,850
For example,
if you're trying to combat alcoholism,

309
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,770
which is just,
you know,

310
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,950
a wretched thing to do because,
well,

311
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,670
all your friends are alcoholic.
All your family drinks too much.

312
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,820
The only thing you know how to do when 
you're socializing is to go to the bar 

313
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,121
and drink too much.
You know when you spend like 20 hours a 

314
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:52,631
week on it,
it's like it's not just that you're 

315
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:54,540
addicted to the substance.
It's like that's how you live.

316
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,760
And so if you want to stop being an 
alcoholic,

317
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,460
not only do you have to stop drinking 
alcohol,

318
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:04,461
but you have to stop seeing all your 
drunk friends and then maybe you've had 

319
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:08,751
them for your whole life and you have to
have continual battles with your drunk 

320
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:12,441
family.
And then you have to figure out 

321
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:14,331
something to do with that 20 hours.
It's now like hanging around your neck 

322
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:18,441
like an Albatross,
and so you have to let that whole part 

323
00:18:18,441 --> 00:18:22,320
of your personality die and a new part 
has to spring forth.

324
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:28,070
And that's what the Phoenix is.
And the Phoenix is the capacity of the 

325
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,641
person to transform.
And so when Harry gets bit by the snake 

326
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:36,840
that freezes him,
he gets seriously injured.

327
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:39,510
The Phoenix comes in Christ,
some tears in his wound,

328
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,340
it prepares him,
Bang.

329
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,400
He's back to life.
And

330
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,020
the strange thing is that that's okay 
with all of the viewers.

331
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:58,050
Now why would that be?
There's nothing about it that's 

332
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,050
rational.

333
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,650
Nothing,
right?

334
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,420
Magic Castle.
That's not rational.

335
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:09,030
Giant snake underneath it.
That's a little more rational turning 

336
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:12,700
you to stone going down there to face 
it,

337
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,890
being rejuvenated by a phoenix.
It's like,

338
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:15,220
yeah,
yeah,

339
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,000
that's okay.
We can.

340
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:21,630
We'll watch that.
We'll swallow it will be completely 

341
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,721
engaged in it.
And the reason for that is because it's 

342
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:24,730
a myth.
It's about how people.

343
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,230
It's a Meta story about how to act about
how to conduct yourself.

344
00:19:29,231 --> 00:19:34,231
In the world to face the things that 
you're afraid of that would otherwise 

345
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:37,591
paralyze you,
to let the death of what is insufficient

346
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:43,660
about you or occur and then to wait for 
the rebirth.
