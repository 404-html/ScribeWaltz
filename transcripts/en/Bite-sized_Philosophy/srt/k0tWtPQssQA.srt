1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,200
Right,
so let's say you have oriented yourself 

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,850
but not perfectly because you're full of
mistakes and errors,

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,720
so then what do you do because you have 
to fix those errors but you still have 

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:13,720
to be oriented

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,530
and this is why I started getting 
interested to get interested in the 

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,351
phenomenon of meaning as a,
as a phenomenological experience to 

7
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:26,510
experience something as meaningful.
It's not exactly obvious what that means

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,270
to experience something as meaningful.
I think that you can,

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,880
you can approach it obliquely,
you know,

10
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:36,881
like if I said watch yourself for two 
weeks and notice when you're doing 

11
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:37,910
something that you regard as meaningful,
I could say,

12
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:38,750
well here,
here's some,

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,680
here's some markers.
You lose a sense of time.

14
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:45,260
You lose a sense of vulnerability,
you're deeply engaged in it.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,380
It seems,
it seems worth the effort,

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,440
right?
You forget yourself while you're doing 

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,421
it.
Maybe you forget your existential 

18
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:58,031
concerns while you're doing it.
You're not ruminating or obsessing about

19
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:00,350
the meaning of your life.
Right?

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,610
So,
so there's markers for,

21
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:04,370
it's like the flow states that chicks at
my highly described.

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,700
Um,

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,610
and then you can experience it.
You experienced it under a certain sort 

24
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,641
of ritualistic conditions.
You might experience it when you go see 

25
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:19,221
a great movie.
You might experience it when you listen 

26
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:19,221
to music.
I think music is a very,

27
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:23,151
very standard pathway for people to have
that kind of experience because 

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,160
virtually everyone gets intimations of 
mute of meaning from music and I think 

29
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:33,351
music music is hierarchically structured
patterns that are representative of 

30
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,860
being laying itself out properly.
It's something like that,

31
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:42,861
so it's an abstract representation of 
proper being and so we can.

32
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,810
We can grapple with the phenomena of 
music and we can.

33
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,900
We can bark or phenomena meaning we can 
box it in a little bit and start to 

34
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,961
conceptualize it.
We can start to conceptualize it perhaps

35
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:59,561
as the manifestation of a deep instinct 
and so I would say well meaning is what 

36
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:03,800
manifests itself when you are,

37
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,570
when you've oriented yourself properly 
and when you've optimized the flow of 

38
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,660
information between you.
When you between you and chaos.

39
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:21,020
That might be the right way of thinking 
about it because you think about a piece

40
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:22,670
of music because you want it to be 
predictable,

41
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,370
but you don't want it to be perfectly 
predictable.

42
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:30,371
You want to be it to be predictable with
some interesting variations and 

43
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:33,610
predictable with some variations that 
make sense and maybe you can 

44
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:33,610
conceptualize that as something like 
this.

45
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,640
It's like it's predictable that this 
order of of stability,

46
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,970
but it's varying down here from time to 
time and so you've got stable stability 

47
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:45,860
there,
but variability there and you can handle

48
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:47,330
that so you want

49
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,890
an overarching structure stability with 
some internal variability and maybe 

50
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,000
that's the way that you update yourself 
without falling apart.

51
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,030
And then I would say you can find the 
pathway,

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,200
the up optimal rate of update by relying
on your sense of meaning.

53
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,800
That's what it's for.
What it tells you is that you're.

54
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,970
You're wandering your way through the 
world between the catastrophes of chaos 

55
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:18,670
in the catastrophes of order and now and
then you swing into the proper locale.

56
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,870
You're where you should be and what 
happens is you get engaged by that.

57
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:25,570
You can meaningfully engaged by that and
it's fragile.

58
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,650
It'll move on you,
right?

59
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:31,330
Because it's very difficult to exist at 
that point constantly.

60
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,610
Your bad habits,
all sorts of things.

61
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:38,611
Your situation.
There's all sorts of things that are 

62
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:40,531
going to interfere with that,
but that doesn't mean that that isn't 

63
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:41,260
where you should be,
and so then you might say,

64
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,750
well,
that's where you should strive to be all

65
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,880
the time,
and then the question might be,

66
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:50,881
well,
what would it be like if you were there 

67
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:50,881
all the time?

68
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:54,330
And I think that's where intimations of 
paradise come from mean when words think

69
00:03:55,941 --> 00:04:00,941
it was.
Wordsworth talked about intimations of 

70
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,031
immortality and childhood.
People tend to romanticize their 

71
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:05,881
childhood because of the sense of 
intense engagement that goes along with 

72
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:10,621
being a child and it's one of the 
wonderful things about being around 

73
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:10,621
children.
Actually.

74
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:10,621
It's,
it's,

75
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:15,030
it's what they pay you for their care 
and the way that children pay you for 

76
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:20,251
their care is that they turn normal 
things into magic again when you're 

77
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:24,100
around them because you've seen it 100 
times before and so when you see it,

78
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:26,500
you don't see it.
You see what you already know,

79
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,650
but when a child sees that they don't 
because they don't know,

80
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,020
they see it and then when you watch them
see it,

81
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,150
you see it too,
and so it's just,

82
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:39,151
it's tremendous fun leading a small 
child around to do things that you've 

83
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:41,230
done before because they're so,
you know,

84
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:42,100
they're like this.

85
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,140
They're like all the time and you know,
maybe that's too much.

86
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:46,990
Then they cry and they get upset and all
of that,

87
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:51,991
but a good part of the time it's just 
wild eyed wonder and then you can see 

88
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:52,720
the world through their eyes and it's 
payment.

89
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,050
And so that's that sense of being 
engaged.

90
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:59,410
Like that is something that people love 
about children and and rightly so,

91
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,160
but it's also a marker to the proper way
of being.

92
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,030
You know,
there,

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,040
there's a dictum in the.
This is a union idea that there's no 

94
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,900
difference between the archetype of the 
wise old man and the archetype of the 

95
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,841
child.
They're the same thing because the wise 

96
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:17,290
old man is the person who found what he 
had in childhood but lost.

97
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,680
Right?
It's a that's a very powerful moment.

98
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,930
Teeth is that the purpose of maturation 
is to return to this state of childhood 

99
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,580
as a mature B,
not to stay in the state of childhood,

100
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:32,050
that's Peter Pan,
but to make the sacrifices necessary for

101
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:35,200
maturation and then return so well.

102
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,280
How do you do that?
Well,

103
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,310
you do that in part by noting what it is
that's meaningful for you to engage in.

104
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,990
I would say it's your nervous system 
reporting to you,

105
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,570
right hemisphere and left hemisphere 
balanced.

106
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,920
The balance between chaos and order 
produces an output that says you are in 

107
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,780
the right place.
It's a perception.

108
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:55,840
The meaning is a perception of being in 
the right place.

109
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,070
It's the genuine thing.
However,

110
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,760
because it can be pathologized.
That's the thing and that's why I think 

111
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,780
there is a call to virtue in most great 
religious traditions.

112
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,960
If you're going to rely on your sense of
meaning to Orient you,

113
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,500
you have to play a straight game because
otherwise you warp and twist the inputs 

114
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,090
and then the mechanism won't function 
properly.

115
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,560
You know,
it's like if you.

116
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,710
If you were only,
if you're,

117
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,990
if you blinded yourself to half the 
world,

118
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:28,991
you can't use your perceptions,
Orient yourself properly because the 

119
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:32,231
half of the world that you're ignoring 
is going to pop up at you unexpectedly 

120
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:35,561
and take you down,
and so if your relationship with the 

121
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,200
world isn't pristine,
honest,

122
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,170
primarily,
then you can't rely on your own internal

123
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:42,350
orienting mechanisms and then you either
fall into chaos,

124
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:47,351
which is an absolute catastrophe,
or you have to rely on some kind of 

125
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:50,261
external authority and that makes you 
prone to possession by tyrannical 

126
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:51,110
etiologies,
for example.

127
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,110
Which gives you that sense of meaning 
that you should in fact have as a 

128
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,110
consequence of your own action.
