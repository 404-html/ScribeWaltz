1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,350
This is a critical issue with regards to
the shamanic transformation is that 

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,040
people go through these terrible,
terrible experiences,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,990
often drug induced by the way,
with regards to the [inaudible].

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,560
They usually use psychedelic chemicals 
of one form or another,

5
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:18,561
often mushrooms,
but they've come up with some very 

6
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:21,231
strange concoctions like Iowasca down in
the Amazon and Iowasca has an amazing 

7
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:26,211
substance.
It's made out of the bark of one thing 

8
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:29,270
and another plant whose name I don't 
remember that hardly even grow in the 

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,681
same place and that has to be cooked 
together in a special way and no one has

10
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:36,180
any idea how the damn Amazonians figured
that out.

11
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:38,640
It looks impossible and if you ask them,
they say,

12
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:40,290
well,
the plants told us how to do it,

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,170
which was western people don't find very
helpful,

14
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:48,171
but the shamans are perfectly healthy,
happy with that description and Iowasca 

15
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:51,870
takes them apart and it does that in 
part because it effects the serotonergic

16
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:53,970
system very,
very powerfully.

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,970
Like all psychedelics do and it 
transports them to another world and 

18
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:00,300
that's how they interpreted.
And,

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,710
and,
and,

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and what we know about psychedelics.
You can put in a thimble and then throw 

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,990
the thimble away.
We know nothing about psychedelics,

22
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:12,240
so there's new experiments going on at 
Johns Hopkins,

23
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:13,950
for example,
with suicide,

24
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:17,130
but in which is part of this active 
chemical in magic mushrooms,

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,340
same structure basically as Lsd and 
masculine and all the real psychedelics 

26
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,241
have basically the same structure except
the one that's derived from Anita 

27
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:30,580
Mascara,
which is called muscular kinic acid and 

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,331
it's a.
it's its own weird thing that no one 

29
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:32,331
knows anything about.
Anyways,

30
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:36,440
they have profound neurochemical effects
in very small doses and I'm the research

31
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:40,440
group at Johns Hopkins has given 
psilocybin to research subjects,

32
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,830
purified psilocybin because they started
the new experimentation with 

33
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,161
psychedelics and that's been banned for 
like 40 years because psychedelics were 

34
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:51,540
so terrifying to our culture that we 
just put them away and it's like,

35
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,310
oh no,
we're not going there.

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,930
And so even from a research perspective,
and even though some of the psychedelics

37
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:01,050
look very promising for the treatment of
disorders like alcoholism,

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,320
they recently used psilocybin to help 
people stop smoking down at Johns 

39
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,410
Hopkins and I think they had an 80 
percent success rate.

40
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:10,950
Which is just like,
that's just absolutely mind boggling and

41
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:13,410
so,
but if you give people silicide and they

42
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:18,411
have a mystical experience,
which is very common among people who 

43
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:21,921
take these sorts of chemicals,
then their personality transforms 

44
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:25,200
permanently such that one year later 
they're one standard deviation,

45
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:30,201
higher in openness and openness is the 
creativity dimension and that seems to 

46
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:32,530
be a permanent transformation and so 
that's really remarkable.

47
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:37,531
And about 80 percent of the people who 
undergo the Johns Hopkins Experiments 

48
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:42,651
report that the experience is like one 
of the two or three most important 

49
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:43,800
things they've ever.
That's never ever happened to them.

50
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,990
And so.
Well that's,

51
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,190
that's something,
you know,

52
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:52,191
it's like.
And then there's this guy named Rick 

53
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:54,501
strassman down at,
I think it was at the University of 

54
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:54,930
Texas and he did experimentation with 
DMT,

55
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
DMT,
die,

56
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:58,950
Mathilde tryptamine I remember if I 
remember correctly,

57
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,340
is the active ingredient in Iowasca and 
you produce it in your brain and it's in

58
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,350
plants.
It's like a very common chemical,

59
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,620
but DMT is a weird hallucinogen because 
it has an extraordinary short mechanism 

60
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:11,830
of action.
It's like,

61
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,390
and people who take it report that 
they're blasted out of their body,

62
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,500
like out of a cannon,
and then they go out somewhere and 

63
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,901
encounter beings of various sorts and 
then 10 minutes later they're back and 

64
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,180
virtually everyone reports that,
which is really strange.

65
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:33,181
And,
and so straussman was giving people dmt 

66
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:34,570
intravenously so that the trip would 
last longer.

67
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,560
He,
this was all,

68
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,770
all nih funded,
uh,

69
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,020
experimentation all cleared with the 
relevant ethics boards all conducted 

70
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,020
within the last 10 years.

71
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,510
And he basically quit doing it because 
he was a pretty straight scientists,

72
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,540
you know,
he was measuring heart rate and pulse 

73
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,491
and all that sort of thing,
trying to look at the physiology and 

74
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:56,251
then the people he was giving these 
chemicals to kept coming back and 

75
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:57,760
telling them these,
these crazy stories.

76
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,000
And uh,
well it just,

77
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,710
it was too much for them,
you know,

78
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,880
and no wonder,
you know,

79
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,740
because they all said the same thing.
And he'd say,

80
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:06,610
well,
that was a dream.

81
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:08,620
And they'd say no.
And it was the most real thing that ever

82
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:09,430
happened to me.
And he'd say,

83
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:09,880
well,
you know,

84
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:11,920
it's an archetypal experience.
And they'd say,

85
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,150
no,
no,

86
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:14,770
no,
that was no archetypal experience.

87
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:19,771
I went somewhere else and I saw things 
and I'm back and I don't care what you 

88
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:20,380
think and like,
who the hell knows?

89
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:21,850
Right?
Because it's all subjective.

90
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,160
But,
but the weird thing about it is that 

91
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,850
everyone's reporting the same thing.
How the hell do you account for that?

92
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,230
And then the shaman,
you know,

93
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:31,330
when they take these psychedelic 
chemicals,

94
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:33,130
they basically say the same thing.
They say,

95
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:35,890
well first of all,
it more or less killed me.

96
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,530
That's this.
No,

97
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,580
I dissolved to the skeleton.
And then I climbed a tree that Unites 

98
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,720
Heaven and earth and I went into the 
realm of the gods and they gave me some 

99
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,030
information and I'm back.
It's like,

100
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,350
okay,
well,

101
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,380
you know,
we don't really know what to make of 

102
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,380
that.
And we certainly.

103
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,290
That's what len describes when he 
describes the shamonic,

104
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,920
this romantic procession,
not the shamanic initiation.

105
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:04,921
And you know,
there's dissolution to a skeleton first 

106
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,010
and then like a death,
this symbolic death or experienced as an

107
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:11,011
actual death.
And then bang up into the realm of the 

108
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:11,011
gods and then they come back.

109
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,720
It's a very old idea and that's a 
medieval representation of the tunnel 

110
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,340
that people travel through at the end of
their life to,

111
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,870
you know,
to find the light,

112
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,420
which is a very common near death 
experience report.

113
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:27,450
And people don't have any idea what the 
hell to do with those reports except 

114
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:27,450
say,
well,

115
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,670
it's the paroxysms of the dying brain,
which you'd expect to be a hell of a lot

116
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:35,671
more random in my opinion.
And the idea is there's a rebirth after 

117
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:39,451
that and you know,
here this is the Scandinavian 

118
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:41,650
representation of that tree that unites 
Earth with heaven.

119
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,260
And so there's this Scandinavian 
representation,

120
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:49,261
has a snake snakes down here eating it.
And then that's the Amazonian 

121
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,100
representation.
It's like,

122
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,380
how the hell do you account for that?
I mean,

123
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:58,381
those,
those pictures are so similar that it's 

124
00:05:58,381 --> 00:05:58,381
just,
it's beyond belief.

125
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,690
Well,
you know,

126
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,660
we lived in trees for a long time,
a long,

127
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:03,800
long,
long,

128
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:05,990
long time,
millions of years,

129
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,240
and there were lots of snakes around 
them.

130
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,000
And so the idea that reality is that 
tree that's surrounded by a snake is,

131
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,460
that's in house,
man.

132
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,140
It's down there,
it's deep.

133
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,240
And there's something about it that's 
true,

134
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,210
not true.
Like we normally think of truth,

135
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,760
a truth true in an entirely different 
manner.

136
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,600
So,
and all that's pretty damn strange.

137
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:29,060
We'll start with this.
My son drew this when he was seven years

138
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:31,130
old.
Blew me away man.

139
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:33,350
I thought it was so cool.
So I had it laminated.

140
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,380
And so here is what it is on the right 
hand side,

141
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:41,381
that's the order.
It's like the Yin Yang thing that's 

142
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:41,480
ordered left side chaos,
right?

143
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,210
And those are all mushroom houses,
which I thought was amazing.

144
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,440
And then there's this river that runs 
right down the middle,

145
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:53,441
like the line for order and chaos.
And then there's this tree that goes up 

146
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:54,500
to heaven and that's having up there.

147
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,750
It's like there is St Peter,
there's the pearly gates,

148
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:00,320
there's the cloud.
It's like he never went to church,

149
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:02,360
you know,
it's like what the hell?

150
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:06,800
And then there's a little bug there that
goes up and down from heaven to earth.

151
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,920
And that was him,
I thought he had a very organized 

152
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:11,920
psyche,
that kid,

153
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,400
he was a very,
very stable kid and still is and know he

154
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,440
drew that.
And I thought,

155
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,630
Jesus,
that's just bloody well,

156
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,690
unbelievable.
And I still think that when I look at 

157
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,691
it,
and that's a great example of an 

158
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:25,940
archetype.
And so we'll see you Tuesday.
