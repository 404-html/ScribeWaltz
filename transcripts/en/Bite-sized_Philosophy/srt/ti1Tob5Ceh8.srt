1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,010
Charlottesville had you know,
with,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,820
with that,
with the,

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,480
with the initial purpose of protecting 
the statue.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,140
Was it good thing?
I don't.

5
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:11,990
I'm not,
I'm not.

6
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,740
I don't know about confederacy except 
for the big thing,

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,220
but honestly it's a,
it's a slippery,

8
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:23,221
slippery slope and the confused souls 
who and the bad just darkened soles for 

9
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,960
sure.
Not Good.

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,410
They screwed up big time because the 
purpose behind it is so important 

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,820
because it's going to be fought founding
fathers next.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,850
Anyone who ever contributed anything to 
Western civilization as we know it is 

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:38,920
already being.
It's already being done.

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,950
James Madison High School in the states.
It's getting renamed because some girls 

15
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:47,730
from random,
one student felt unsafe and so yeah,

16
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,510
this is a serious issue and I wanted 
like,

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,320
I feel like really up against the wall 
now because now they found they're 

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,320
Nazis.
Man.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,120
The Nazis are flooding the streets now.
So how do we,

20
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,130
how do we possibly,
you know,

21
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,870
kind of save our cakes.

22
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,550
You had to bring it up,
didn't ya?

23
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,850
Well,
having the right degenerate into 

24
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:26,850
identity politics does not seem to be a 
part,

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,850
a positive solution.
So one of the things I would say is 

26
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,291
that,
like I understand why the identity 

27
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:38,191
politics that has been practiced so 
assiduously and so you have a stating 

28
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:40,690
Lee by the left has been cooptive by the
right.

29
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,900
I understand that.
But then here's what I would say to the 

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,450
people on the right who were playing 
that game.

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,190
If you play the game of your enemies and
you win,

32
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,670
you win their game,
you don't win.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's not victory.
You just become the most successful 

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,260
exponent of their pathology was.
How was that a good thing?

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,570
It's a bad thing.
So what does that leave people as old as

36
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:09,670
an alternative?
Well,

37
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,170
I don't think that the Caucasians,
let's say,

38
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,820
should revert to being white.
I think that's a bad idea.

39
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,120
It's a dangerous idea and it's coming 
fast and I don't like to see that.

40
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:30,330
I think the whole group identity thing 
is seriously pathological.

41
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,950
I think we've made big mistakes in 
Canada.

42
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,550
I understand why at least to some degree
in that respect and that large mistakes 

43
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,351
are being made all over the western 
world where we're making your group 

44
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:45,430
identity.
The most important thing about you?

45
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,650
I think that's reprehensible.
I think it's devastating.

46
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,650
I think it's genocidal in its ultimate 
expression.

47
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,280
I think it will bring down our 
civilization if we pursue it.

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,770
We be playing that game.
So what's the alternative?

49
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,920
You know,
I've thought for a long time about a 

50
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,021
political career really forever since I 
was like 12 really for a long time and 

51
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:15,970
I've always decided against it because 
it seemed to me that the proper level of

52
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:20,971
analysis with regards to the solution of
the problem that we're facing isn't 

53
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:25,291
political and that's why I think it's a 
mistake when what I'm doing gets 

54
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:25,930
politicized either by me or others.

55
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,030
I think that the way that you deal with 
this is to put yourself together.

56
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,330
I really believe that is that because I 
think that individual people are far 

57
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,231
more powerful.
There's certainly far more evil than 

58
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:42,511
they're willing to consider,
but that's also a sign of their 

59
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:45,091
unbelievable power.
So I think that what you do is you aim 

60
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,150
high and put yourself together and stay 
the hell away from the ideologues 

61
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,550
because they're hiding.
They're hiding behind a wall.

62
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:59,551
They're not able to come out and fight 
on their own behalf and so the way 

63
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:04,501
forward through the logical mass,
and that's the lesson of Western 

64
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:07,801
culture,
is to place the individual at the place 

65
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:11,251
of paramount importance and to make the 
group identity emerge only when 

66
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,500
necessary and secondarily,
if ever.

67
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,590
And so you can do that.
You can do that now.

68
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,670
You can do that tomorrow.

69
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,500
Like you can put your life together.
And again,

70
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:25,501
as,
as I mentioned to the other young man 

71
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:25,720
who asked the question is,
you won't hurt anyone doing that,

72
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,900
right?
You pick up your goddamn responsibility.

73
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,660
Certain yourself out,
fix up your family,

74
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,870
right?
And then you can be a force for good in 

75
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,870
the culture.
And if enough people do that,

76
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,560
the ideological mass will just 
evaporate.

77
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,680
It'll just disappear.
I think that's the way you show people 

78
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,110
the right path forward to is that you 
say,

79
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:44,560
well,
look,

80
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:45,790
um,
we would like,

81
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,030
we would like it so much.
If you could thrive as an individual,

82
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,120
drop your cult like affiliation,
right?

83
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,210
Step out of the shadows,
the demonic shadows your ideological 

84
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,030
possession and step forward as a fully 
developed person into the light.

85
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,060
Do it by example.
That's your.

86
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,950
That's your best bet,
man.

87
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,350
So that's what it looks like to me.

88
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,680
Thank you.
