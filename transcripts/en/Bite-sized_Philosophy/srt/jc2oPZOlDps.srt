1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,870
Cain killed Abel,
Abel Caine's children killed seven 

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,470
canes,
grandchildren kill 70 fold,

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,860
and then tubilcain pops up on the 
horizon and he's the person who makes 

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,840
artifices of war and so the story in its
fragmentary manner ties the individual's

5
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:24,361
psychopathology that's resentful and 
revenge seeking to the proclivity for 

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:29,691
broad scale warfare,
and this really hit me because I was 

7
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:32,871
interested particularly in what was 
happening in the Nazi camps with the 

8
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:36,591
guards because the guards were 
gratuitously cruel and I was very 

9
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,750
curious about that.
And so here's an interesting story.

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,840
This was in a book called a ordinary 
Germans,

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,770
Hitler's willing executioners,
and it was a book that was written about

12
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:48,060
30 years ago.
The challenge,

13
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:51,510
the idea that the Nazi phenomenon was 
taught down order following,

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,720
which I don't believe,
by the way I think that that's a very a 

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,260
week we kype orthosis fascistic 
societies are fascistic at every single 

16
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:03,660
level of organization spiritually within
the family,

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,950
within the local community.

18
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,780
It's like a holograph.
It's the same.

19
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:09,090
Absolutely everywhere.
It's not top down.

20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,390
I mean,
there are leaders who get produced and 

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,011
maybe they catalyze it,
but to blame it on the leaders is to 

22
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:16,920
forget about the process by which the 
leaders come to be.

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,710
So No,
you don't get a pass that way.

24
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:25,190
So here's one of the things that 
happened as the Nazis started to lose 

25
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,350
the war.
So here's what you should have done.

26
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:29,940
If you are a Nazi and he wanted to win 
the war,

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,820
you should have enslaved the Jews and 
the Gypsies and had them work,

28
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,270
right?
You should have had them work for the 

29
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,241
benefit of the victory.
And then if you want to liquidate them 

30
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:42,210
afterwards,
that's the logical thing to do.

31
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:45,570
If you want to win and we assume that 
Hitler wanted to win,

32
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,820
but that's not a very intelligent 
assumption.

33
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,030
Why would you assume that he wasn't 
exactly a good guy?

34
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:56,150
So why should we assume that he was 
aiming at the good that he was 

35
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,430
promoting,
even in his own terms,

36
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,820
right?
The glorious everlasting for Third 

37
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:01,820
Reich,
right?

38
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,810
That a rule for a thousand years and 
being a bastion of civilization and 

39
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,140
music because that's the sort of thing 
he purported to be interested in.

40
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,650
Well,
so what do you do with the Jews and the 

41
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:12,650
Gypsies?
Well,

42
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,770
round them up,
fine in slave and find you.

43
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:16,770
Don't kill them.
You certainly don't devote a substantial

44
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:21,771
proportion of your war resources well,
you're losing to accelerate the rate at 

45
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:27,471
which the extermination is taking place 
because that's a bit counterproductive 

46
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:31,310
unless what you're aiming at is the 
maximum possible mayhem in the shortest 

47
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:31,470
period of time.
Well,

48
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,840
so what happened as the Germans started 
to lose the war,

49
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,690
did Hitler lose faith in his own 
ability?

50
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,750
No.
He believed that the Germans had to be 

51
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,450
traded with weakness and so he's 
perfectly willing to accelerate the rate

52
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:47,451
at which Germany was losing the war and 
so when Hitler and his minions had the 

53
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:47,820
choice,
here's the choice.

54
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,390
You can suspend your unnecessary 
demolition of people when the damn war 

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,610
and then pick it up afterwards or while 
you're losing.

56
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,440
You can just accelerate.
The may have,

57
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:00,940
even though it's was like,
did they pick?

58
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,120
Well,
they picked to accelerate the mayhem and

59
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:06,220
so to me there's an old psychoanalytic 
idea.

60
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,310
I think this was derived by young.
If you can't figure out what someone is 

61
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,081
doing or why,
look at the outcome and infer the 

62
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:18,930
motivation.
If it produces may him,

63
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,460
perhaps it was aiming at me hip.
Now you know,

64
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:26,730
you have to use that dictum carefully.
If someone's irritating,

65
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,770
you know,
maybe it's because you're irritable,

66
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:33,771
had you should sort yourself out,
but maybe it's because they're actually 

67
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:35,190
aiming at irritating you and that's the 
actual motivation.

68
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,730
So perhaps not,
but it's another tool in your analytical

69
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:42,690
armament.
So and so you see,

70
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:45,420
well this is the thing about warfare 
that's so interesting about,

71
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,550
about,
because you can,

72
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,670
you can attribute it to territory,
let you can attribute it to a war for 

73
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,250
resources.
That's what the,

74
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,340
I would say wretchedly

75
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,160
simple minded economists presume people 
fight over scarce resources.

76
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,840
It's like,
hey,

77
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,300
we're a little bit more sophisticated 
than that.

78
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,820
And first of all,
what resources are you talking about?

79
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,590
The bloody anyway,
it had nothing.

80
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,480
They live perfectly well.
What did they have?

81
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,310
Snow and seal.
Blubber.

82
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,790
You know,
people can live and unbelievably 

83
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,711
deprived conditions,
and so the idea that there are natural 

84
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:27,731
resources that we fight over because 
there's a shortage of them is a pretty 

85
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:28,250
oversimplified view of human beings.
It's like,

86
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:29,330
well,
why do people fight?

87
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,570
Well,
maybe they fight sometimes for good 

88
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:34,570
reasons,
but very,

89
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,451
very frequently they fight for bad 
reasons and those bad reasons are our 

90
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:39,800
personal as well as sociocultural and 
economic.

91
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,750
You know,
if you were announced a prison guard,

92
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:46,751
for example,
whatever pathologies you were carrying 

93
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:49,631
around in your destructive little soul,
whatever element of Cain was deeply 

94
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:53,111
embedded in you had the opportunity to 
be manifest foley at every moment of 

95
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:53,111
your waking existence.

96
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:55,340
Right?
You had these people who were completely

97
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:58,190
beholden to you with no rights 
whatsoever,

98
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,630
to whom you could do whatever you're 
evil little heart determined think,

99
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:07,631
well,
maybe that was a motivation for putting 

100
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:07,631
them there to begin with and all the 
cover story about,

101
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:11,980
well,
we're trying to build the Third Reich 

102
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,601
and we're trying to stabilize the state 
and we're trying to do all these good 

103
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:16,421
things.
Maybe that's just a cover story for the 

104
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:16,421
real motivation,
which is nothing but,

105
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:19,640
but what the construction of death camps
that killed 6 million people,

106
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,990
how about that and the obliteration of 
120 million people on the planet and the

107
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,350
and the and the and the leaving of 
European runes.

108
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,850
Maybe that was the motivation or are we 
going to attribute to Hitler the highest

109
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:33,680
possible motives?
Say No,

110
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:35,930
it's an archetype of manifestation of 
cane.

111
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,390
Now he's going to put up a front that 
says,

112
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,620
well,
I'm your savior.

113
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,580
It's like,
well,

114
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,980
destructive people think that cane is 
their savior.
