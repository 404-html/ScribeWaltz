1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
Heidegger thought that Western 
philosophy have gone wrong basically 

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,421
since the time of socrates,
which was quite a long time and he said 

3
00:00:08,421 --> 00:00:12,711
that we were,
we became interested in what the world 

4
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:15,441
was made of and how we knew things and 
what we should have been interested in 

5
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:19,101
stead was the nature and quality of 
being and what he meant by being isn't 

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,610
the objective world.
What he meant by being was the manner in

7
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:30,651
which you have experience and so there 
were elements of being that aren't 

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,670
objective elements and so I would say 
pain is a phenomenological reality,

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,760
right?
It's not something you can.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You can index it objectively,
but the index is not the phenomena and 

11
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,040
you know,
is your pain real.

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,300
See this as this is a question for 
people who think there's no such thing 

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,331
as meaning.
Like you try to argue yourself out of 

14
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:56,430
pain and see how far you get.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,330
You might think,
well,

16
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:59,490
that's not the sort of meaning I meant.
It's like,

17
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:01,380
you know,
a negative meaning is a place to start,

18
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:03,720
right?
Because if something's negative and it's

19
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:08,721
real,
it does imply that there's something 

20
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:08,721
positive that's real.
It might be harder to get ahold of,

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,760
at least it's not pain,
but pain descartes,

22
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,760
and I'll close with this.
You guys can have a great day.

23
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,870
Cart implemented a method he called 
radical doubt when he went on his 

24
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:27,891
philosophical journey and what descartes
looked for was one thing he couldn't 

25
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:32,421
doubt because he was probably clinically
depressed and he was just doubting 

26
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:32,421
everything.
It's like,

27
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:32,730
well,
why?

28
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,990
How do I know the world isn't just been 
Mirage made by an evil demon to,

29
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:37,800
you know,
to,

30
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:40,350
uh,
to obfuscate reality from me.

31
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,250
While his conclusion was the one thing 
that he could not dispute was that he 

32
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,120
could,
he was an could think.

33
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,870
Now,
I don't think they cart really meant 

34
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,431
what we meant by think.
I think he meant more what we would mean

35
00:01:55,531 --> 00:02:00,030
by experience because thought has become
a much more narrowly defined,

36
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,630
you know,
term since the time of descartes.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,480
So I don't think he meant,
I think therefore I am.

38
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:08,910
I think he meant something like I 
experienced.

39
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:12,580
I have experienced therefore yama.
Regardless of that martyr.

40
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:15,180
People think about it as thought 
heidegger was different.

41
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:20,181
Heidegger basically said the one thing 
you can dispute is that that experience 

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,390
is your experience.
It exists.

43
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,270
You can't.
It's almost by definition,

44
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,300
right?
It's like the definition of exist and 

45
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,121
then he was interested in what the 
fundamental elements of existence I've 

46
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:39,210
existed.
This work and they're not outcomes like 

47
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,530
you know,
like the fundamental elements of the 

48
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,301
object of world.
There are more things like pain and for 

49
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:45,170
me that was the thing that stopped me 
from Delhi.

50
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,240
It's like a candidate.
The existence of pain,

51
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,700
it seems real and I might say it seems 
more real than anything else.

52
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,890
Now you might say you don't believe 
that,

53
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,650
but I would say,
I don't care what you think you believe,

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,200
I'll watch you when you're in pain and 
every single one of your actions will 

55
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,360
indicate that you believed in it.
And not only that,

56
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:08,830
that you can't not believe in it.
Right?

57
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:10,750
It's there and it's there so much that,

58
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,810
well,
that's a meaning and so that it's in 

59
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,080
that way that heidegger,
at least in part thought of existence as

60
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,170
or experience as composed of meetings.
And so part of the reason that this 

61
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,430
course is called maps of meaning is 
because one of the things we're going to

62
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:31,431
look at is the structure of meaning,
and we're going to start with negative 

63
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:33,030
meaning because from my perspective,
it's,

64
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,510
look,
you can doubt whether or not good 

65
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,461
exists,
but once I'm done telling you about the 

66
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:43,941
things I know about human history,
there won't be a single person in this 

67
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:46,911
room who thinks that evil doesn't exist 
and you might think that's a bloody 

68
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:47,580
horrible thing to learn,
but it's not.

69
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,330
It's unbelievably useful because once 
you can establish something that you 

70
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,590
cannot deny,
then you can move from that.

71
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,190
And I think you can hypothesize that if 
you're capable of detecting radical 

72
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:05,640
evil,
I'll tell you about unit seven,

73
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:08,100
31 at some point,
or you can look them up yourself.

74
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:09,780
I wouldn't recommend it.
By the way,

75
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,600
once you can identify radical evil and 
you think,

76
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:15,050
well,
that's.

77
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,450
That's just beyond a doubt,
that's reprehensible.

78
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:19,670
There's no justification for that 
whatsoever,

79
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,890
no matter what.
Whenever,

80
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,280
while then you've got something to stand
on and you can start thinking,

81
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:26,930
well,
what's the absolute opposite of that?

82
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:28,070
Then,
you know,

83
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:33,071
it might be,
how is it that you could conduct 

84
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:33,071
yourself so that in your sphere of 
influence,

85
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,190
the probability like that anything like 
that would ever happen is reduced to the

86
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:39,610
absolute maximum.
Well,

87
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,580
that's a reasonable moral question.
And,

88
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,200
and,
and I,

89
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,990
I don't think it's something that you 
can dispense with,

90
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:49,991
with like a casual nihilism.
I don't think a nihilist can dispense 

91
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:52,310
with it because he even nihilists 
suffer.

92
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,740
Thank God for that.
You know,

93
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,400
it's their only is their only source of 
potential salvation.

94
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,230
Sometimes they notice it,
oh,

95
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:05,231
I'm suffering about all this nihilism.
Maybe that indicates that there's 

96
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:06,230
something flawed in it.
It's always possible.
