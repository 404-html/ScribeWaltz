1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,150
This is really an interesting one,
I think.

2
00:00:02,151 --> 00:00:07,151
I mean,
so I don't know what God's doing here 

3
00:00:07,151 --> 00:00:10,601
exactly,
but he's helping ignite the sacrificial 

4
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:15,041
flame and that's kind of an interesting 
idea I think because you know,

5
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:18,710
let's say that you have an impulse to 
make a sacrifice.

6
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:20,450
You think,
well,

7
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:22,240
I should change this about my life.
What?

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,510
What's like?
Where does that come from?

9
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:28,511
That impulse is just,
well just manifests itself out of 

10
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:29,750
nothing.
So what order you came up with it,

11
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:34,751
well,
you might want to start thinking about 

12
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:35,780
that thinking so surely that you come up
with your own thoughts.

13
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:40,781
You don't come up with your damn dreams.
Do you pay just happened and God only 

14
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:43,400
knows where they come from.
They come from your brain.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,440
Whoa boy,
that's a sophisticated answer that come 

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,440
from your unconscious.
Well,

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,910
that's not much better.
At least it's somewhat better,

18
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:54,260
but there are those matt,
amazing dramas take place in the theater

19
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:59,261
of your imagination at night.
You don't even understand what they are 

20
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:00,440
and yet they occur night after night and
those things,

21
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:02,630
dreams,
they can contain wisdom that it just.

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,900
Well,
it just staggers the person who has the 

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:08,900
dream.
Once they get the key to the dream,

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,450
once they remembered,
it's like,

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,600
oh look,
you just revealed a bunch of wisdom to 

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:14,640
yourself that you didn't know what.
Where'd that come from?

27
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,500
Well,
you don't know.

28
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,290
How in the world can you dream up things
that you don't know?

29
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,160
That's a tough one.
Maybe we'll talk about that at some 

30
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,011
point in this lecture series because 
there are some reasonable things that 

31
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:29,520
can be said about that,
but you know the idea of that

32
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,250
there's something that's not you young 
would call it the self.

33
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:39,251
Carl Jung would call it the self,
which he thought of it as the totality 

34
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:42,641
of your being across time and space.
It's something like that and that you 

35
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:46,631
know each second that you exist is a 
slice of the self manifesting itself 

36
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:48,090
across time and space,
and he thought of the.

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,260
The self is partly the voice of 
conscience.

38
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,290
Whatever that is that helps guide you 
when you have to make a difficult 

39
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,560
decision and a difficult decision might 
be,

40
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,720
well,
what do I need to sacrifice?

41
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:01,880
What is,
how do I need to discipline myself,

42
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:04,220
right?
What do I need to forego?

43
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,710
Well,
how do you figure those things out?

44
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,530
Well,
you know,

45
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,550
we'll just picture is trying to put 
forth the idea that perhaps if you had 

46
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,241
established the proper relationship with
God the father and we've talked about 

47
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:18,860
what that might mean,
then he would help figure out how to get

48
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:23,861
this sacrificial fires burning so that 
you could stay in a proper relationship 

49
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,100
with him across time.
Well,

50
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:28,070
if that's such an unreasonable 
proposition,

51
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,410
it.
What's the alternative proposition?

52
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,380
Well,
this isn't working out very well,

53
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,970
that's for sure.
You know,

54
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,940
Kate seems to be doing it.
I don't know what it is.

55
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:42,941
It's like he says,
if he thinks he can only do it himself 

56
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:43,940
or maybe he wants only to take credit 
for it or something like that,

57
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,260
he's not in this

58
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,950
grateful,
let's say,

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,160
and inquiring grateful and inquiring 
posture because that's what a prayer for

60
00:02:55,831 --> 00:03:00,831
posture should be.
It should be grateful and inquiring and 

61
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:03,291
grateful is,
thank God things aren't worse for me 

62
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,031
than they are and you should be grateful
about that because they could be a lot 

63
00:03:06,031 --> 00:03:10,360
worse than they are and they can be so 
bad and inquiring would be,

64
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,450
well,
I don't really know how I could make it 

65
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:15,450
better,
but I'm.

66
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:15,730
I'm open to suggestions,
man,

67
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:17,770
if I can figure out how to do it all,
try it.

68
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,790
That's the.
That's the humility and the inquiry.

69
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,270
That's a humble inquiry.
How could I make things better?

70
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,720
It's something like that and that's what
sacrifices do I need to make in order to

71
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:32,110
make things better.
That's a good question to ask yourself.

72
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,210
You could ask yourself that every 
morning,

73
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,380
what sacrifice do I have to make to make
things better?

74
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,190
You can decide what constitutes better.
How about that?

75
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,620
Then it's not even as if it's being 
imposed on you.

76
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:47,200
Come up with your own notion of what 
constitutes better.

77
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,690
Try to make it sophisticated.
Should just be better for you because 

78
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:52,780
that isn't going to work very well.
Right?

79
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,340
You're.
You're just gonna fall downstairs.

80
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,420
If you do that because you have to live 
with other people and besides stupid 

81
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,200
anyways,
what are you going to do like can't even

82
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,090
just nothing you could even say about 
that.

83
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:09,091
It's so that that's the.
That's the attitude of a very badly 

84
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:13,500
behaved hyper aggressive two year old 
and I mean that technically and so you 

85
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:16,390
could.
You could ask yourself,

86
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:19,780
well,
how I have this day that lays itself out

87
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:24,781
in front of me?
What thing could I let go of that's 

88
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:28,210
impeding my progress that if I let go of
would make my life better,

89
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:31,390
my family's life better,
my culture's life better,

90
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:36,391
my being better,
and then that would give you something 

91
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:36,400
to do for the day,
wouldn't it?

92
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,200
Into a justify your miserable life 
because you need that.

93
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,530
That's the whole point of the first 
story of Adam and eve.

94
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,080
What do you have?
A miserable life?

95
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,250
Okay,
what am I going to do about that?

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,620
Well,
if you just have a miserable life,

97
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:56,440
you're just going to suffer stupidly and
get bitter about it.

98
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:58,060
That's what happened is to cane.
It's like,

99
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,230
well,
how about not doing that?

100
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:02,650
Because that seems to just take a bad 
deal and make it worse.

101
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,890
How about making a sacrifice and seeing 
if you can please God and put being on 

102
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:10,810
track?
God,

103
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,200
that'd be something to do.
What could be better than that?

104
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,030
What could possibly be better than that?
Well,

105
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,650
that's why it's archetipal band because 
nothing's better than that.

106
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,120
That's where tops out.
So when you can do that,

107
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:30,121
you could do that every day.
You'd have to do it in a little way 

108
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,941
because like what good are you?
You know you're not going to go and 

109
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:36,490
bring this socialist utopia in to being 
in one fell swoop.

110
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,090
You might also think that one of the 
things came might figure out here.

111
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,640
There's a couple of things that just 
aren't going right for him,

112
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,480
downwind of the fire,
not the right place to blow from and the

113
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:05,771
fact that he's in hidden valley in Hays 
and smoke and breathing it in and the 

114
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:10,121
fire isn't burning.
Might be an indication that he's doing 

115
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:12,440
something wrong or he could be wiping 
his eyes and say,

116
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,710
Jesus,
what kind of stupid bloody universe 

117
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:17,710
would produce smoke like this?
It's like,

118
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,610
yes,
well that's the more likely outcome,

119
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,300
and the Lord said unto Cain,
why Art Thou wroth and why is they 

120
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,231
countenance fallen?
If Thou knewest well Shalt Thou not be 

121
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:36,690
accepted?
Now that's an interesting line because,

122
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,660
and I've looked at a variety of 
different translations of.

123
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:43,290
This is seventh verse here,
like a bunch of them,

124
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:48,291
because the translation for that,
that's a critical line and the 

125
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:52,611
translation really matters and so I'll 
tell you what I think the story is what 

126
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:55,080
I've been able to figure out,
and I'm sure I haven't got it completely

127
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,370
right,
but it's so he asks,

128
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,680
God says to him,
if you do well,

129
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:04,110
won't you be accepted?
What does the hint there?

130
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:05,580
Right?
It's something like,

131
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:07,440
well,
things aren't going so well for you,

132
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,540
so the first thing you might think is

133
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,650
you're not doing well.
What does that mean?

134
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:18,651
You're not doing good?
Does that mean you're not acting 

135
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:21,441
properly means it's the hint because God
is suggesting that if you are doing it 

136
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,770
properly,
you would be successful.

137
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,950
I had a friend at one point who was a 
very bitter person and he had a bunch of

138
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:36,570
problems and some of them were self 
inflicted in some of them were fate,

139
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:39,010
I suppose that he had.
He was,

140
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,010
he had become very,
very destructive,

141
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,390
murderously,
destructive,

142
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:44,280
genocidally destructive.
I would say.

143
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:49,281
You could see it in his dreams and,
and he lived with me for awhile and I 

144
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:56,261
knew him very well.
He was a friend of mine from the time I 

145
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:57,740
was 12 until the time he committed 
suicide when he was about 40 and a

146
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,380
when he lived with me.
I was trying to help him get on his 

147
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,571
feet,
which was why he had come to live with 

148
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:08,401
me because he thought maybe I could help
him get on his feet and he could only 

149
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:10,960
take relatively low level jobs.
You know,

150
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:13,060
like he had some mechanical ability,
didn't,

151
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:14,520
he didn't get educated.
Although he's a very,

152
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:19,521
very smart person.
He probably had an Iq of about 135 or 

153
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:20,110
something like that.
He's very smart and so he was bitter too

154
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:22,800
because he hadn't educated themselves to
the level that his,

155
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,030
you know,
his intellectual,

156
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,410
abandoned.
So we had to take jobs that were beneath

157
00:08:26,411 --> 00:08:29,980
him intellectually and he had a,
he had that real intellectual arrogance,

158
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:34,981
you know,
because he was smart and really smart 

159
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,711
people often come to believe that only 
smart matters and if they're smart and 

160
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:43,471
all that and all it matters is smart and
then the world isn't sort of laying 

161
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:46,200
itself at their feet than they've been 
terribly betrayed and,

162
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,880
and then they cling to their 
intelligence,

163
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:50,680
which is more like a talent or a gift.

164
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,810
Like it's a,
like it's an idol,

165
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,980
you know,
a false idol,

166
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:58,981
which is exactly what it in a very 
dangerous one and get cynical about the 

167
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:03,801
stupidity of the world and the fact that
their are talents weren't properly 

168
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:05,130
recognized.
And that's just not that helpful because

169
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:07,080
smart is a good thing.
But I'll tell you,

170
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,060
if you don't use it properly,
it will devour you.

171
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:12,000
Just like all arbitrarily assigned 
talent.

172
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,740
Right?
So you might have a talent,

173
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:16,770
but it's your friend if you use it 
properly.

174
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:19,440
And you misuse it,
it will be your enemy,

175
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,800
and maybe that's how God keeps the 
cosmic scales adjusted.

176
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,470
But anyhow,
my friend was a very smart person,

177
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:28,320
although not as smart as he thought he 
was unfortunately,

178
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:33,321
and,
but he hadn't done what would have been 

179
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:36,081
necessary with that intelligence to make
it manifest itself properly in the 

180
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:40,251
world.
And that also embittered him because he 

181
00:09:40,251 --> 00:09:42,150
also knew that there was more that he 
could have done if he would have done it

182
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,360
and perhaps more that he could still do 
what I was suggesting to him while he 

183
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,110
was living with us because he was,
you know,

184
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,040
two levels from homeless by that point 
was that he should find a job that he 

185
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,200
could find working in a garage,
working in a shop,

186
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:03,201
something like that because he had some 
mechanical ability and that he should 

187
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:03,201
do.

188
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,720
He should separate himself from the 
arrogance that made him presumed that 

189
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,011
such a job would be beneath him because 
at that point no job was beneath him.

190
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:15,150
And,
but more importantly,

191
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,360
it's not so obvious that jobs are 
beneath people,

192
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,150
you know,
because even if you're a,

193
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,160
even if you imagine you have a job as a 
checkout person in a,

194
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,400
in a grocery store,
you know,

195
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:31,920
as a fairly unskilled job,
you can be some miserable,

196
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:34,590
resentful,
horrid bastard doing that job.

197
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:35,400
Boy,
you know,

198
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:40,401
you can come in there just exuding 
resentment and bitterness and making 

199
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:44,300
mistakes and making sure that every 
customer that passes by you has a 

200
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,080
slightly worse day than they need to 
write.

201
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,710
And,
and you know,

202
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,820
pilfering time and perhaps pilfering 
goods and being resentful about the 

203
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,471
people who,
who gave you the position because 

204
00:10:57,471 --> 00:10:58,470
they're above you in the dominance 
hierarchy and talking,

205
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,880
you know,
bad things.

206
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:02,450
Gossiping behind the back of your 
coworkers is like,

207
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,640
you can take your menial position self 
described and turn that into a very nice

208
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:09,780
little slice of hell.
