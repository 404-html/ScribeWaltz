1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,950
It's,
it's unbelievable the degree to which 

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,850
our sanity depends on our functioning,
sociological structure and,

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,540
and here's why.
Well,

4
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:14,541
first of all,
you kind of need to know what to do 

5
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:17,481
every day.
You have to have a routine because 

6
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:17,481
you're an animal,
you know,

7
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:19,080
and you know if you have a dog or a cat,
dogs are really good example of this.

8
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:24,081
Dogs like routine,
they like to be walked the number of 

9
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:26,931
times a day that they're supposed to be 
walked and they get quite sick very 

10
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:26,931
rapidly.
If you don't,

11
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:31,650
if you don't routinize their days,
children are exactly the same way.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,210
Now you can overdo it,
right?

13
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:34,410
But still,
you know,

14
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:36,960
you need to know approximately when you 
should get up,

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,150
should be approximately the same 
everyday.

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,010
You need to know approximately.
You're going,

17
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:46,011
when you're going to eat,
you need to know what you're going to 

18
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:46,011
eat.

19
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:46,011
You need to know who you're going to eat
with.

20
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:48,870
You need to know where to buy your food.
It's like 80 percent of your life,

21
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,930
70 percent of your life.
Something like that consists of those 

22
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,620
things that you do every single day that
you repeat,

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,460
and those are often the things that 
people think about as the trivial 

24
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,521
elements of their life,
but one of the things I would like to 

25
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:05,040
point out to you if you do the 
mathematics I,

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,640
I did this with a client of mine who was
having a hard time putting his child to 

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,871
bet they were having a fight every night
and I knew by that time the studies 

28
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:19,581
indicate that most parents only spend 20
minutes per day of one on one time with 

29
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:24,531
their child.
Now the reason for that is that people 

30
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:28,041
are busy and it's actually not that easy
to parse out 20 minutes of one on one 

31
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:28,041
time.

32
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,550
It's a lot bloody more time than you 
think,

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,810
but that's all there is.
Twenty minutes and he's spending like 40

34
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:38,811
minutes a day fighting with his kid,
trying to get the kid to go to bed and 

35
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:40,170
that's not very entertaining.
You know,

36
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:40,760
you think,
well,

37
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,350
it's just having a scrap with a kid 
about going to bed,

38
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:43,770
but it's.
No,

39
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:44,190
no,
no,

40
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:44,730
no,
no.

41
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,580
If it happens every day,
it's a catastrophe,

42
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,700
so you do the math,
so we'll say five hours a week for the 

43
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:52,980
sake of argument,
just to keep it simple.

44
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:57,810
It's 20 hours a month,
it's 240 hours a year.

45
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:02,811
That's 60 slash 40 hour work weeks,
so that guy was basically spending a 

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,970
month and a half of work weeks doing 
absolutely nothing but having a wretched

47
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:09,840
time fighting with his son,
trying to get them to go to bed.

48
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,670
Horrible,
right?

49
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:15,180
That's just way too much time to spend 
doing something like that.

50
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:20,570
If you want to actually have a positive 
relationship with someone because it's 

51
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,400
just too.
It's just too punishing and so well,

52
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:28,401
so you need structure,
you need predictability and you need 

53
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:28,890
more of it than you think just to keep 
you sane.

54
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,610
Now,
if you're lucky and and maybe a bit odd,

55
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,820
you can deviate five percent from the 
norm or 10 percent from the norm or 

56
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,410
something like that carefully and 
cautiously.

57
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,750
As long as the rest of you is all well 
ordered,

58
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:47,751
an informative manner,
you might be able to get away with that 

59
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,451
and you might be able to sustain that 
across time and people might be able to 

60
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:53,571
tolerate you if you do it or maybe 
you'll get really lucky and you happen 

61
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:56,991
to be creative but reasonably well put 
together and people will actually be 

62
00:02:56,991 --> 00:02:58,980
happy that there's something 
idiosyncratic and unique about you.

63
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,440
But even under those circumstances,
mostly what you want is to have a 

64
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,290
routine.
It's disciplined,

65
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,720
that's predictable and bloody well stick
to it.

66
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,130
You're going to be way healthier and 
happier and Saner if you do that.

67
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:17,131
And then the other thing that you need,
because this is one of the things the 

68
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:20,911
psychoanalyst got wrong,
I think is that they overestimated the 

69
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:23,080
degree to which sanity was a consequence
of internal,

70
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,990
of being properly structured internally.
You know,

71
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,600
because from the psychoanalytic point of
view,

72
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:33,601
you're sort of an ego and that ego is 
inside you and of course it rests on an 

73
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:37,441
unconscious structure.
But the purpose of psychoanalytic 

74
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:40,170
analysis is to sort out that unconscious
structure and the ego on top of it and 

75
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,970
to make you a fully functioning and 
autonomous individual,

76
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,390
but there's a problem with that because 
the reason that you're saying as a fully

77
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:54,691
functional and antonymous human being 
isn't because you've organized your 

78
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:55,720
psyche,
even though that's important.

79
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,150
The reason that you're saying,
if you're aware,

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,200
if you have a well organized unconscious
and ego is because other people can 

81
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,330
tolerate having you around for 
reasonably extensive periods of time and

82
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:12,331
we'll cuff you across the back of the 
head every time you do something so 

83
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:14,290
stupid that people will dislike you 
permanently if you continue,

84
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,560
and so what people are doing to each 
other all the time,

85
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:22,710
just nonstop is broadcasting.
Sanity signals back and forth,

86
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:25,000
right?
It's like you smile at people.

87
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:30,001
If they're well,
if they're not only behaving property 

88
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:31,600
but behaving in a way that you would 
like to see them continue to behave,

89
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,160
you frown at them.
If they're not,

90
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,360
you ignore them.
If they're not,

91
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,290
you shun them.
You,

92
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,470
you roll your eyes out them.
You manifested disgust face.

93
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:40,240
You don't listen to them,
you interrupt them,

94
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,850
you won't cooperate with them,
you won't compete with them.

95
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,450
It's like you're blasting signals of 
other people about how to regulate their

96
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:49,540
behavior so frequently.
Well,

97
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:54,541
it just makes up all of your social 
interaction and that's why we face each 

98
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:58,021
other and we have emotional displays on 
her face and we're looking at each 

99
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:01,201
other's eyes and we know exactly we know
as much as we can about what's going on 

100
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:05,671
with each other given that we don't have
immediate access to the contents of 

101
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:09,151
their consciousness.
And so partly what you're doing with 

102
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:10,870
your routine is establishing yourself as
a credible,

103
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,820
reliable,
trustworthy,

104
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,970
potentially interesting human being who 
isn't going to do anything too erratic 

105
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,800
at any moment and everyone else is 
around there tapping you into shape,

106
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:24,700
making sure that that's exactly what you
are and that's how you stay sane.

107
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:29,701
And so what happens to people too,
if they don't have a routine and they 

108
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:33,151
get isolated as they start to drift and 
they drift badly because the world is 

109
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:37,180
too complicated for you to keep it 
organized all by yourself.

110
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,210
You just cannot do it.
So a lot of our,

111
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,360
so we outsource the problem of sanity 
and it's very intelligent that we 

112
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,131
outsourced the problem of sanity because
sanity is an impossibly complex problem.

113
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,520
And so the way that we manage the 
incredibly complex problem is we have a 

114
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,571
very large number of brains working 
simultaneously on the problem all the 

115
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:00,700
time.
