1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,840
The Soviets,
given their idea of class guilt,

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:08,340
which sounds a lot like white privilege 
to me or any other form of racism,

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,370
they use that doctrine to just round up 
all the kulaks they were the productive 

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,181
farmers and ship them off to Siberia and
then 6 million Ukrainian starved to 

5
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:20,181
death.
But you know,

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,250
they had too many Ukrainians anyway,
so it didn't really matter.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,330
So anyways,
back to the postmodern types.

8
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:28,310
Well,
you know,

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,320
this all came was revealed in such 
painful detail that even the kind of 

10
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:37,200
closed minded idealogue that Norman 
referred to just quite,

11
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:42,201
couldn't,
couldn't quite muster up the moral 

12
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,290
courage to keep beating the same damn 
drum.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,920
So what they did instead being highly 
intelligent individuals,

14
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:51,921
was play a game of sleight of hand and 
transformed these Marxist 

15
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:54,060
presuppositions into postmodernism in 
the 19 seventies.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,070
And the idea basically was,
well,

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,220
the working class isn't going to rise up
and crushed the bourgeoisie because 

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,420
first of all they're getting rich and 
that wasn't supposed to happen.

19
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:07,421
And second,
well it sort of seemed to be a 

20
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:07,421
catastrophe when that occurred,
let's say in Russia.

21
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:10,350
And so maybe we won't do that anymore 
because the working class actually isn't

22
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:12,930
buying into this either,
which is also a problem,

23
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:18,230
you know,
having internalized their own 

24
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,230
oppression,
they wouldn't buy into this,

25
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,100
to the global myth of Utopia.
So maybe it's because they've had some 

26
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,160
sense.
It's certainly possible.

27
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:25,410
But anyways,
the slight of hand was,

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,250
oh,
well fine,

29
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:31,251
we'll just play a different one.
Oppressor versus oppressed game and 

30
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:31,680
we'll introduce identity politics.

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,300
It's like,
okay,

32
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:39,301
okay,
you're not being oppressed because of 

33
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,831
you're a member of the working class.
You're being oppressed because you're a 

34
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:43,441
woman or you're being oppressed because 
you have an ethnicity that's outside the

35
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,730
main paradigm,
whatever that might be.

36
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,010
Um,
or it's because of your,

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,030
your,
your,

38
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:52,570
your sexual preference or your sexual 
identity or whatever.

39
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:56,690
Whatever places you in some manner 
outside the normative culture.

40
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,360
You know,
the thing is the postmodernist,

41
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,280
you know,
you might think,

42
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:01,780
well,
your culture is good for something.

43
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:04,900
It gives you a hierarchy of value.
It rewards competent people,

44
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,210
it gives you a direction so you can 
climb up,

45
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:12,211
you know,
because otherwise everything's leveled 

46
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:12,211
to nothing.
And then why do anything?

47
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,300
They don't care about any of that.
They don't believe that there's any such

48
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,520
thing as competence.
They don't believe that there's any such

49
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:18,820
thing as up.
This is all postmodernism wipes,

50
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:19,960
all of that out.

51
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,810
And so when the postmodernists analyze 
the text,

52
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:27,811
all they care about is how it privileges
the position of the author and who had 

53
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:29,230
impresses.
And that's the only thing they regard as

54
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:31,960
real.
And they don't believe in grand unifying

55
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:36,961
narratives.
They don't believe that there's a 

56
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,461
Canadian identity.
They don't believe that there's an 

57
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:40,291
American identity.
They don't believe that there is a 

58
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:40,291
western identity.
They don't believe that value structures

59
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,770
exist,
or if they are,

60
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,440
they're replaceable with some other 
value structure.

61
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:48,220
They certainly don't believe that they 
have any biological grounding.

62
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:50,530
That there's any such thing as a human 
being.

63
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:53,560
It's all socially constructed,
which is really convenient.

64
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:58,561
If what you want to do is be the author 
of an entirely social constructed you 

65
00:02:58,561 --> 00:02:59,920
utopia that you can run.
