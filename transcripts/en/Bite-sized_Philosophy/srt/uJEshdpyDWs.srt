1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,810
God has a little chat with him and he 
says,

2
00:00:01,811 --> 00:00:02,610
well,
W W,

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,910
why are you angry and and why?
Why are you upset?

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,310
And cain says,
and God says,

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,310
if you do well,
won't you be accepted?

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,430
And if you don't do well,
sin lies at your door and unto thee 

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,370
shall be his desire.
And now shout rule over him.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,520
Okay?
That's a very mangled translation I 

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:23,530
would say,
so I'm going to take it apart.

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,070
So what God says is while you're angry 
and you're upset,

11
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:27,670
it's like,
well,

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,240
what's your problem?
And then God tells kate if you did 

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,720
things properly,
they would work out for you.

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,780
Well,
it's the last thing he wants to hear it 

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:39,780
because what cain wants to believe is 
that the reason he's not doing very well

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,760
is because there's no sense having any 
faith in the logos.

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,690
The transcendent is,
is evil and aimed exactly against him,

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,730
and the entire social contract is 
faulty.

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,580
That's what he wants to hear,
but that isn't what God says.

20
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:52,480
God says,
well,

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,080
wait a minute,
maybe you're doing something wrong.

22
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,310
Well,

23
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,350
that's maybe a worse message than 
everything else is corrupt.

24
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,380
It's like you're having a problem 
because you're just not everything you 

25
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:06,380
could be.
Well,

26
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,000
and then God says something really nasty
and you can't tell from this lines.

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,300
I read a bunch of translations to try to
figure out exactly what it meant.

28
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:14,790
So this is what God tells kate.
He says,

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,830
you're in a room in a house and there's 
something at the door,

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,890
and he uses a metaphor.
God uses a metaphor.

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,860
It's a sexually,
a lot aroused predatory cat,

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,990
and you invited in even invited.
Did you know that it has evil intent.

33
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,510
You invited in to meet with you,
right?

34
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,450
And you're.
It's,

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,370
it's union with you.
This,

36
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,390
this malevolent force,
this sexual union with you has produced 

37
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,440
an offspring and that offspring is what 
possesses you.

38
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,010
And so not only have you done something 
wrong,

39
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:55,190
you've,
you've invited the spirit of wrongdoing 

40
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,730
into your life and you've creatively 
intermingled it with it voluntarily to 

41
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:01,230
bring forth a monster of your own 
creation.

42
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,750
So that's what God tells Kane.
So like,

43
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,840
look,
it's bad enough that God says,

44
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:09,400
you know,
you should get your act together because

45
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,430
maybe that's why things aren't going so 
well for you before you criticize the 

46
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,910
transcendent and the world and the 
structure of being.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,850
Maybe you're doing something wrong,
but it's worse than that.

48
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:20,560
He says,
not only are you doing something wrong,

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,010
you bloody well know you're doing 
something wrong and you and you're doing

50
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:29,011
it creatively and with intent,
so not only are things not going well 

51
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:32,881
for you,
but you've played a creative role in 

52
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:35,260
producing that situation and so god 
basically says,

53
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,470
I am taking zero responsibility for 
rejecting your sacrifice.

54
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,490
It's all on you.
And so kane leaves and he's like,

55
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,610
seriously?
Not Happy with that response because he 

56
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,630
wanted to hear Pat,
pat,

57
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:52,660
you're a victim of circumstance and 
everything's conspiring against you.

58
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:57,661
And really being God,
I should get my act together and just 

59
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:57,661
give you what you want.

60
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:00,160
Because obviously being God I'm wrong 
and you're right.

61
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,340
Well that isn't what happens.
It's exactly the opposite of that.

62
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,110
It's completely on you.
That's the,

63
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,870
that's the judgment.
And so kane leaves and believe me,

64
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,760
he's,
he was wroth before it.

65
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,690
His countenance had fallen before,
but it's nothing like it is now.

66
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,270
And so he's hits the next stage and he 
thinks,

67
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:19,420
okay,
I'm going to take my revenge.

68
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,600
What am I going to do?
I'm going to find the most innocent and 

69
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,930
worthwhile thing that's favored of God 
and I'm going to kill it.

70
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,240
And that's what he does.
And it doesn't matter.

71
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,310
That's his brother and able,
you know,

72
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,890
we're drawing the inference.
Ables done the right things.

73
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:36,070
Everyone likes them.
Everything's flourishing for Abel.

74
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,160
He's a good guy.
He's one of those people that you meet 

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,380
that has everything.
And then you meet them and you wish you 

76
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,391
could hate them,
but you can't because they're really 

77
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:45,391
good people.

78
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:45,970
And then you're really hate them because
not only do they have everything,

79
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:49,420
but it appears that they deserve it.
And there's nothing that sort of sits in

80
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:52,180
your soul and rots it more than that 
realization.

81
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,920
And so that's the situation with Cain.
And so thinks Cain talked with Abel,

82
00:03:56,921 --> 00:04:01,921
his brother,
and it came to pass when they were in 

83
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:01,921
the field that Cain rose up against 
Abel,

84
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:03,370
his brother,
and slew him.

85
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,120
So that's so interesting because look,
look what happens to cane here.

86
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,740
So he's not doing well.
He's separated from the transcendent and

87
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:16,741
from society.
He's bitterly resentful and now he goes 

88
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:18,700
out and kills the very thing that he 
most wants to be.

89
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,130
So he destroys his own ideal,
right?

90
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:25,690
He just demolishes his own ideal.
That's how far his resentment has pushed

91
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:26,590
him.
And so he's,

92
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,040
he's done right?
But it doesn't matter because it enables

93
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:30,970
him to take revenge.

94
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,860
So he doesn't care.
It's like,

95
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:37,861
it's like the suicidal school shooter 
that blows off his head at the end of 

96
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,470
his mayhem.
It's like it doesn't matter to him.

97
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:42,910
It's part of the same art form.
And the Lord says unto Cain,

98
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:45,460
where is Abel?
And cain said,

99
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,540
I know.
I don't know,

100
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,250
am I my brother's keeper?
While that's a good question,

101
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:51,880
and that's why it's posed in the story,
because the answer that I supposed to be

102
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,860
yes.
And God says,

103
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:58,861
what have you done?
The Voice of your brother's blood cries 

104
00:04:58,861 --> 00:05:01,680
unto me from the ground.
That's actually the Motif that 

105
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,810
Dostoevsky explorers,
I would say in crime and punishment 

106
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,890
because what happens is that was calling
the coffee's cane for all intents and 

107
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,500
purposes,
and he commits a murder,

108
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,400
but he gets away with it.
Well,

109
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,950
so he thinks so.
We thinks no one suspects him.

110
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,040
He buries the money.
He can't stand to touch the body.

111
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,040
He buries it in a in an abandoned lot,
and he's drawn there now and then to 

112
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,630
look at where it is,
but he can't touch it because the money.

113
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,320
It's so funny because the money before 
he kills the pawnbroker is not the same 

114
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,430
as the money after he kills the pawn 
broker.

115
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,670
And the risk only the before he kills 
the pawnbroker is not the same as the 

116
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,360
risk and the cough after he kills the 
pole broker.

117
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:46,150
In fact,
they're not the same at all.

118
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,140
And so [inaudible] Nicole have is 
tormented by God,

119
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,330
you could say,
but not from the external world.

120
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,470
He sets the crime up quite nicely.
It's that this,

121
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,590
this spirit against which transgressed 
tortures him from within and there's no 

122
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,861
escape from it,
and so eventually what happens in crime 

123
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:08,711
and punishment is was called Nicole have
continues to manifest himself as guilty 

124
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:13,481
in every possible way until he receives 
the punishment that he desires because 

125
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:14,930
it's the only way that he can set things
right.

126
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,670
He actually,
he actually,

127
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,360
he essentially turns himself in 
eventually because he can't tolerate 

128
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,890
what he's done so well.
So that's the idea.

129
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,710
The Voice of thy brother's blood cries 
unto me from the ground.

130
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,460
It's guilt

131
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:39,130
and now you're cursed from the earth 
which has opened her mouth to receive 

132
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,500
your brother's blood from thy hand.
When you till the ground,

133
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:46,501
it will not henceforth yield to you its 
strength and a fugitive and a vagabond 

134
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,770
shall thou be in the earth.
You know?

135
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,780
And you might say,
well why does God not just straight and 

136
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,261
dead?
And the answer to that perhaps is that 

137
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:04,350
wouldn't be sufficient punishment.
That's what it looks like to me.

138
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,100
It's like what's the punishment?
You live with what you did.

139
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,930
Right?
And I don't want anybody taking you out 

140
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:14,930
either because then you won't have to 
live with what you did.

141
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,670
So that's the punishment.
And cain says,

142
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,210
under the Lord,
my punishment is greater than I can 

143
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:23,210
bear.
It's like,

144
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,000
yeah,
behold you have driven me out this day 

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,520
from the face of the earth and from thy 
face shall I be here.

146
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,830
That's the same as what happens to Adam 
in the garden of Eden.

147
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:33,831
Remember,
Adam hides from God and he has his 

148
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:35,310
reasons.
And now cain is alienated from God.

149
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:40,311
There's no read,
there's no reconstructing that 

150
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:43,761
relationship.
He's put himself by violating his 

151
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:47,480
contract,
but say with the transcendent and also 

152
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:47,480
with society and also with his own 
spirit,

153
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,190
he's put himself outside the possibility
of redemption.

154
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,700
And that's why he says the punishment is
greater than I can bear.

155
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,650
There's no hope left,
right?

156
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,110
So he's in hell for all intents and 
purposes.
