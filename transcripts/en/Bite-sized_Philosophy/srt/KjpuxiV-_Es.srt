1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,870
Life is suffering,
right?

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,220
Indisputable.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,250
What do you do about that?
You,

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,420
you voluntarily accepted and then strive
to overcome the suffering.

5
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:22,151
That's a consequence of that and you do 
that for you and you do that in a way 

6
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:26,861
that makes it better for other people 
and then that works and one question 

7
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:27,380
might be,
well,

8
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:30,680
how well does it work?
And the answer is you're.

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,230
The only way that you can find out is by
trying it.

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,830
That's it.
That's the existential element of it.

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,860
The proof is to be derived by the 
incarnation of the attitude in your own 

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,840
life.
No one can tell you how it will work for

13
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:49,841
you.
It's the thing that your destiny is to 

14
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,111
discover that and you have to make.
You have to make the decisions to begin 

15
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:58,001
with.
It's like because you can't do this 

16
00:00:58,001 --> 00:00:58,001
without commitment,
you have to commit to it first.

17
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:02,270
That's the act of faith that the 
character guard was so insistent upon.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,750
You have to say,
I'm going to act as if being as good.

19
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:08,810
I'm going to act as if truth is the 
pathway to enlightenment.

20
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,830
I'm going to act as if I should pursue 
the deepest meaning possible in my life,

21
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,860
and there's there's reasons to do none 
of those,

22
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,700
their real reasons,
so it's really a decision,

23
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,270
but you can't find out what the 
consequences of the decision is unless 

24
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,361
you make the decision.
I think the same thing happens when you 

25
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:28,361
get married.
By the way,

26
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:32,390
if you think you might leave,
you're not married and then you think,

27
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:33,470
well,
the marriage didn't succeed.

28
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:33,980
It's like,
well,

29
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:38,981
maybe you were never married because the
rule is you don't get to leave and 

30
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:43,451
there's a reason for that rule.
Now I'm not saying that there aren't 

31
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:44,210
situations where there should be 
exceptions made for that.

32
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:47,270
That's not the point.
The point is that there's some games you

33
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:52,271
don't get to play unless you're all in,
and the other thing that's so 

34
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:53,900
interesting about being alive is that 
you're all in.

35
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,410
No matter what you do,
you're all in.

36
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,620
This is going to kill you.
So I think you might as well play the 

37
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,800
most magnificent game you can while 
you're waiting,

38
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,380
because do you have anything better to 
do?

39
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,840
Really?
Why not?

40
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,330
Pick the best thing possible that you 
could do.

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Why not do that?
Maybe you could justify you're wretched 

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:20,800
existence to yourself that way I think 
you could.

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,240
That's what it looks like.
You know,

44
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,400
people find such meaning in the 
responsibilities they adopted,

45
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,440
stops making them ask questions about 
what life is for.

46
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,360
If you have a newborn child,
for example,

47
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,460
like unless you're really in a bad way,
psychotically depressed or or maybe your

48
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:41,290
personality really needs some retooling,
you stop thinking about

49
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,170
anything but ensuring that that baby is 
doing well and if someone comes along 

50
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:52,050
and asks you an existential question 
about your commitment to that,

51
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,250
the right response is why are you asking
me such stupid questions when,

52
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,860
when the,
when this,

53
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,930
this is manifesting itself right in 
front of your eyes like how blind can 

54
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,050
you be?
That isn't a time for,

55
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,390
for questions about the meaning of life.
The answer is right in front of you and 

56
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,420
if you can't see it,
it's not because life has no meaning.

57
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:15,421
It's because you're blind mean.
That's what they image of the Virgin 

58
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:17,890
mother and the child is all about.
It's like,

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,870
what's the answer to the meaning of 
life?

60
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,360
Here's an answer.
It's like,

61
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:23,650
well,
I'm going to criticize that.

62
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,270
Well,
go right ahead.

63
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,630
You know?
It's like.

64
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,730
It's like what?
What?

65
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,620
You're.
You're like a,

66
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,580
you're like a,
what do you call that?

67
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,280
A termite.
Knowing on a temple,

68
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,240
there's no,
there's no utility and that sort of 

69
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,521
criticism.
It's blindness and it's the same thing 

70
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:47,201
with regards to the path of the hero.
It's like it glistens in front of you 

71
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:48,650
and you can criticize it.
It's like,

72
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,280
fine.

73
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,420
Put the cart before the horse and see 
how far you get.

74
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,030
So I thought to bring full closure to 
the class,

75
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,360
I was trying to solve this terrible 
puzzle that confronted me for and many 

76
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:13,571
other people about how it was that human
beings got themselves in such a tangle 

77
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:18,851
about what they believed,
such a tangle that we were pointing the 

78
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:20,210
ultimate weapons of destruction at one 
another.

79
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,860
Which by the way,
we are still doing.

80
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,640
I thought,
okay,

81
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,950
well I understand that we need their 
belief systems.

82
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:32,951
They orient us and that means there will
be conflict between belief systems and 

83
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:35,930
that can be a catastrophe and that's 
being played out everywhere.

84
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:37,340
Again,
in very many ways.

85
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,160
What's the solution to that?
Well,

86
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,820
one possibility is there is no solution.
It's just mayhem all the way around 

87
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,620
could be the case,
but it seemed to me as I delved into it 

88
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,580
that the proper solution to that was to 
live properly as an individual because 

89
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:58,580
you're more powerful than you think way 
more powerful than you think.

90
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:01,400
I mean God only knows what you are in 
the final analysis.

91
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,420
You're blind to your own weaknesses,
but you're also blind to your own 

92
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,120
strengths and so then I think,
well,

93
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,210
if you got your act together,
it'd be better for you and instantly it 

94
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:13,940
would be better for your family.
Assuming they wanted you to get your act

95
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:15,550
together and not everyone does,
but.

96
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,080
And then it would be better for the 
community.

97
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,230
It's like how far can you take that if 
you stopped wasting time and if you 

98
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,501
start lying and if you oriented yourself
to the highest possible good that you 

99
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:27,350
could conceive of and you committed to 
that,

100
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,860
how much good could you do?
Well,

101
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:32,750
I would say money.
Find out.

102
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,010
So that's what I think you should do.
You should find out you don't have 

103
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,541
anything better to do and there was 
nothing in it as far as I've been able 

104
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,060
to tell.
There's nothing in it but good.

105
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:49,880
So

106
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,300
maybe you could sort yourself out so 
that you wanted nothing but the good and

107
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,940
and then maybe you could help make that 
manifest in the world and maybe we 

108
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,320
wouldn't have all these terrible 
problems.

109
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,800
Then at least we'd have fewer of them 
and that would be a start.

110
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,620
So it's the,
it's the,

111
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,520
the answer to the problem of humanity is
the,

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,240
is the,
is the integrity of the individual.

113
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,590
That's the answer.
So and states that are predicated on 

114
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:28,340
that realization are healthy.
So in states that aren't,

115
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,060
are doomed to stagnation and 
catastrophic collapse and personalities 

116
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:40,241
that are predicated on self tyranny.
And the tyranny of others are doomed and

117
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,540
doomed to collapse.
So and then you think,

118
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,460
well,
what's the barrier?

119
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,480
The barriers are you willing to accept 
the responsibility and part of the 

120
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,570
answer to that is reduced the damn 
responsibility until it's tolerable.

121
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,760
You don't have to have to fix everything
at once.

122
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,090
You could just start by fixing the 
things that you could fix or you could 

123
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,021
even do it more.
You can do it with even less self 

124
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:13,871
sacrifice.
You could start by fixing only the 

125
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:13,871
things that you want to fix.
God,

126
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:16,880
you can get a massive way that way.
So do it.

127
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,120
See what happens.
That's what you should have been taught 

128
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,761
in university right from the beginning.
It's like aim at the highest good tool 

129
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:29,021
yourself into something that can attain 
it and go out there and manifested in 

130
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:31,460
the world and everything.
That everything that comes your way will

131
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:31,790
be

132
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,740
everything that comes your way will be a
blessing.

133
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,280
And so,
oh,

134
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:42,430
you have to do is give up your 
resentment and your hatred.

135
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,600
I know that's a hard thing to give up 
because he had plenty of reason for it.

136
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,760
That's probably a good place to stop 
console.

137
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,470
It was a pleasure.
