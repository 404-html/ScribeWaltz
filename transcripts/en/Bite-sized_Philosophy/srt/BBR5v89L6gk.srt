1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,620
How the as as a message to people who 
are watching this and trying to work 

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,311
their way through a lot of young people 
who were trying to navigate this 

3
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:11,801
increasingly perilous minefield of 
divisive politics.

4
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:16,100
In today's Day and age,
how do they know?

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,920
What are the heuristics they use?
What are the signposts they used to 

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,430
understand,
am I on the right path?

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,760
Is is what I'm being taught or is what 
I'm being attracted to politically 

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,630
motivated from a sense of what's 
actually best for the community that I'm

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,100
nominally caring for?

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,170
Well,
that requires.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,400
It might say,
well that requires careful meditation 

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,560
and prayer if you want it to be 
traditional about it.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,920
I would say you have to Orient.
You have to determine this is a process 

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,060
of soul searching.
What are you oriented towards?

15
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:51,040
And the answer could easily be nothing.
Well,

16
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,170
this is why I produced the future 
authoring program.

17
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,690
Like you've got to be oriented towards 
something because otherwise you're 

18
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,860
disoriented.
You just spin around in circles and then

19
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:02,080
you suffer and sort of people around 
you.

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,380
It's not a good solution.
Orient itself towards something.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,290
You have to figure out what it is,
what will work for you,

22
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,970
what goal would would justify the 
suffering of your life.

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,060
Start trying to piece that together.
You're going to get better at it,

24
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,270
but it's a personal process and and you 
should use your education to inform that

25
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:26,731
so you need a personal place to stand 
because otherwise you're going to be 

26
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:29,851
handed a place to stand on a plate and 
it may be one that that makes you a 

27
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:31,150
puppet of someone else's goals.

28
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,680
So I would say,
you know,

29
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,110
what are,
what are the processes?

30
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,130
Well,
I think what I've recommended to people 

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,270
is clean up your room.
That's a good start.

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,480
Organize your local landscape.
Schedule your time,

33
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,630
start taking control of yourself.
See if you can stop saying things you 

34
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,711
know to be lies.
That's not the same as telling the 

35
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:58,591
truth.
You don't get to do that to begin with 

36
00:01:58,591 --> 00:01:58,840
because you're not good enough at it to 
even attempt it in some sense,

37
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,070
but everyone can stop saying things they
know to be false hoods.

38
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,350
They can use their own damn definition 
of falsehood,

39
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,750
right?
But in your definition,

40
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,270
importantly,
I think in your definition,

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,280
falsehood includes the higher level 
moral truth,

42
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,810
living wrong.
You can say something that is literally 

43
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:20,810
true,
but of course,

44
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,011
like you said earlier,
it's a black truth in the sense that at 

45
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,711
a moral level you're saying something to
cause a social effect that is actually 

46
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:28,390
negative.
Say,

47
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,450
stop saying things that violate your 
conscience.

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,440
Instead of stop saying things you know 
to be untrue,

49
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,870
because we run into the truth problem.
But I would say,

50
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:39,310
stop.
Here's another idea.

51
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,370
Stop saying and doing things that make 
you feel weak is all you have to do is 

52
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,141
pay attention to that.
Some things you do will make you feel 

53
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:51,660
disintegrated.
It's a physiological sensation 

54
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,750
disintegrated in week.
It's something that Carl Rogers 

55
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,120
commented on and he thought about that 
as part of,

56
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,580
oh,
now I can't remember the word.

57
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,840
Something like,
but that isn't the word he used,

58
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,310
but some things,
some things improve your integrity on.

59
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:11,311
Some things disintegrate.
You now the things that disintegrate 

60
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:15,001
you,
you often do to impress other people or 

61
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,480
because you're taking a shortcut or 
you're escaping what you know to be your

62
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:21,481
moral obligation and your moral 
obligation stems naturally from your 

63
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:22,810
aims,
like once once you have aims,

64
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:24,040
you have moral obligations.

65
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,490
They come together because the moral 
obligation is what you need to do in 

66
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,390
order to obtain the Ame,
so and if you don't have a name,

67
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,880
well then you're aimless,
so that's not a solution.

68
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,520
So along with the aims come the moral 
obligations.

69
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,590
Then when you violate the moral 
obligations,

70
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:40,600
you'll have a sense of that violation.
It's like,

71
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:42,200
well,
you have to stop doing that or,

72
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,560
or that's something you could do.
You don't have to.

73
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,010
You don't have to do any of this,
but I would say that's where where 

74
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,440
people should start.
You start small.

75
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,270
It's not small.
You think it's small.

76
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,060
It's not small.
I had a girl come up to me last night at

77
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:57,280
the end of my talk and this happens all 
the time.

78
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,670
She said,
I started cleaning up my room last year 

79
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,970
and it completely changed my life.
She said,

80
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:06,190
your room is an externalization of your 
mind,

81
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,650
and that's right.
That's exactly true to the degree that 

82
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,580
you're in your room,
the room is,

83
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,070
you know,
that isn't how people think,

84
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,100
but that's okay.
It doesn't matter if they think that 

85
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,100
way.
That's how it is.

86
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,900
So straighten up what you can straighten
up and quit saying things that make you 

87
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,890
feel weak and then then you'll know what
to do next.
