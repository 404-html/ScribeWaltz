1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,300
That's actually why people get married,
you know,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,230
just so you know,

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,780
because this is built into marital vows,
I'm not leaving ever no matter what.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,000
It's like,
okay,

5
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:16,520
well that definitely puts a boundary 
around our arguments,

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,580
right?
Because I can't say every time you 

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,921
manifest one of your flaws,
which you're likely to do just as often 

8
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:24,440
as me.
Well enough for this.

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,730
It's like,
that's horrible,

10
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:30,731
man.
If your whole life is while every time 

11
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:30,731
you get out of line,
I'm out of here.

12
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,190
It's like,
how the hell are you?

13
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,220
First of all,
you're not going to admit to ever doing 

14
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:36,220
anything wrong.
Second,

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,180
you're going to be on your.
You're like,

16
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:39,470
ah,
like a scared cat.

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,960
The entire relationship because well,
who knows?

18
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:43,730
It could just come to an end at any 
moment.

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,020
It's like,
you know,

20
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:46,040
people say,
well,

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,950
if you're.
If the possibility of divorce is open,

22
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,450
it makes you free.
It's like,

23
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:51,290
yeah,
that's what you want.

24
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,940
Do you want to be free?
A really,

25
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,240
really,
so you can't predict anything.

26
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,930
That's what you're after.
It's a vow and it says,

27
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:04,931
look,
I know that you're trouble me too,

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,770
so we won't leave no matter what 
happens.

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,330
Well,
that's a hell of a vowel,

30
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:16,331
but that's why it's about right.
That's why you take it in front of a 

31
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:18,761
bunch of people.
That's why it's supposed to be a sacred 

32
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:18,761
act.
It's like,

33
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:19,580
what's the alternative?
What's the alternative?

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,880
Everything is mutable and changeable at 
any moment.

35
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,140
Well,
go ahead.

36
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:24,800
You liver,
your liver,

37
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,900
your life like that,
and see what you're like when you're 50 

38
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:29,900
Jesus.
It's dismal.

39
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,950
Two or three divorces.
Your family's fragmented.

40
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,850
You've got no continuity of narrative.
It's not.

41
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:36,830
It's not good for the kids,
not by any stretch of the imagination,

42
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:42,140
and so it's a form of voluntary 
enslavement I suppose,

43
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:47,141
but it's also equivalent to the adoption
of a responsibility and there's more to 

44
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:47,630
it than that.
If you can't run away,

45
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:50,000
then you can solve your problems because
it might be,

46
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,770
okay,
well I'm stuck with you.

47
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,260
So how about we fix things

48
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,800
because the alternative is we're going 
to be in a boxing match for the next 40 

49
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:00,960
years.
That's the alternative.

50
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,410
So.
And you think you're going to fix 

51
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:06,410
problems without something like that 
hanging over your head.

52
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,330
There isn't a chance.
You'll just avoid them because that's 

53
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:11,330
what people do.
It's really hard to,

54
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,390
to solve problems,
especially in relationship.

55
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,120
We're having a fight and I find out that
it's because you're.

56
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,900
You were abused by your uncle when you 
were five or some God damn thing.

57
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:19,500
You know,
it's like,

58
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,440
it's very frequent that that sort of 
thing happens.

59
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,910
You,
there's the partner,

60
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:27,450
your partner is manifesting some weird 
anomalous behavior.

61
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,200
You just can't make heads or tails of 
it.

62
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:31,410
That doesn't seem related to what you're
doing at all.

63
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,500
They don't want to talk about it.
And so as soon as you bring it up,

64
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,600
they get mad and then you bring it up 
again.

65
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,600
They even get mad or,
and they tell you that you're not going 

66
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:41,600
to talk about that or they're going to 
leave.

67
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,950
And so maybe you really,
really persistent because you're kind of

68
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:46,440
a son of a bitch and then they break 
down and cry,

69
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,950
you know?
And then they have this horrible memory 

70
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:51,960
that comes flooding forward.
That's completely.

71
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,540
You don't know what to do with it,
and then you have to sort it out.

72
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,360
It's like you think you're going to do 
that unless there's a good reason.

73
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,110
You have to know we better start this 
out and we're going to be carrying it 

74
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,330
around for the next 40 years.
That may be is enough motivation,

75
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,670
so you'll actually try hard to solve a 
problem.

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,440
It's a lot easier to say,
well,

77
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,630
sorry,
we're not going there,

78
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,550
but then good,
and you'll have it every day,

79
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,800
every day,
every God damn day for the rest of your 

80
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:17,800
life.
