1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,060
And then in the next scene you see this 
model home up for destruction.

2
00:00:04,061 --> 00:00:06,520
It's quite an interesting scene.
Symbolically.

3
00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:06,850
See

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
in the middle of this house here,
there's a stain glass window that has a 

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,680
Mandela on it.
We'll we'll see it more clearly in a 

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:18,680
minute.
And amended.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,710
Mandela is a sacred symbol of the self.
That's,

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,470
that's the union interpretation.
It's a symbol.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,110
It's very difficult to describe,
but it's a symbol.

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,190
Music is a Mandela except it's played 
out across time.

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,830
So you could say that that thing is the 
same as music,

12
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:33,770
but it's Kinda like a slice of music.
It's,

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,550
it's,
it's the same idea.

14
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:40,551
You know,
sometimes you see those slow motion or 

15
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:43,200
sped up motion videos of a flower 
unfolding that's the same.

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,350
It's the same idea.
You can imagine that being set to music 

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,051
and somehow that would make sense that 
Mandela is like a symbol of the 

18
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,411
unfolding of being and,
or the source of meaning or something 

19
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:56,490
like that.
And it's also a symbol of the self.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,740
I'm from the union perspective.
And so there you see it more clearly.

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,740
Kids are starting to burn this place.
And,

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,800
and trash it,
and they're dragging the grand piano 

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:09,800
down the down the stairs,
uh,

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,150
the destruction of high culture about 
which they're nothing but cynical 

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,420
because they don't believe that hard 
work and sacrifice can,

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,900
can produce something of any value and 
they want to bring it down and destroy 

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,060
it.
And that's partly because

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,060
can see this in the story of Cain and 
Abel.

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,340
Table is hard working and everyone likes
him and he makes the proper sacrifices.

30
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:36,341
And so his life goes really well.
And that's part of the reason that cain 

31
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:37,460
hates him and he's jealous and 
resentful.

32
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:39,770
But worse than that,
if you're around someone,

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,010
if you're not doing very well,
especially if that's your own fault.

34
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,730
If you're not doing very well and you're
around someone who's doing very well,

35
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:51,380
it's very painful because the mere fact 
of there being judges you.

36
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,170
And so it's very easy to want to destroy
that,

37
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,220
to destroy that ideal so that you don't 
have to live with the terrible 

38
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,200
consequences of seeing it embodied in 
front of you.

39
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,920
And so part of the reason that people 
want to tear things down is so that they

40
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:10,370
don't have anything to contrast 
themselves against and to feel bad.

41
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:11,990
And that's exactly what's happening 
here.

42
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,080
The kids are destroying all of this 
culture,

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,920
roughly speaking because it judges them 
the fact that it exists,

44
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,810
judges them.
And I've often thought this about 

45
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,040
Michelangelo Statue of David,
which is this heroic.

46
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:32,320
So David was a shepherd obviously,
and it doesn't sound like much,

47
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:37,321
but back in those times being a shepherd
was a big deal because there were lions 

48
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:40,750
and you had a slingshot.
And so like you got to defend your sheep

49
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:43,960
from lions with a slingshot.
So you weren't exactly this,

50
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:48,430
like 19th century English guy dressed in
a fairly blue suit.

51
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,200
You were tough as a bloody.

52
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,700
Well,
it's someone who would go after lion 

53
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:56,700
with a slingshot.
It's no joke.

54
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,730
Anyways,
the statue is very heroic and you know,

55
00:02:57,731 --> 00:02:58,750
you look at that,
you think,

56
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:00,160
well,
the possibility of,

57
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,650
of human kind.
But by the same token,

58
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:06,460
it's also what you're not.
And so as well as being an ideal,

59
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:08,740
it's a judge.
And every ideal is a judge,

60
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,970
so yes.

61
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,350
Yup.
So you're,

62
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,640
you're using that as an example to 
illustrate the coming fitter as a result

63
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,460
of not being

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,520
able to achieve a status as a result,
as a result of hard work.

65
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,540
But in the example of Canaan,
April.

66
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,550
Yeah.
I'm like one was a shepherd and the 

67
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,060
other was a farmer.
And the one who knows no one is.

68
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,810
Yes,
that's right.

69
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,510
What was the shepherd was the one who 
was favorite?

70
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,500
Yes,
that's right.

71
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,830
Was that a result of the hard work or 
was that a result of good question?

72
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,630
The stories as well.
That's a good question.

73
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:55,631
Those stories are very,
very complicated and the story is very 

74
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:58,430
ambivalent about whether Kane is not 
rewarded because he makes bad sacrifices

75
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:02,070
or because God's just in a bad mood and 
that I like that.

76
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,500
If you read the story,
I've read multiple translations of the 

77
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,830
story and when,
when caden comes to God,

78
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,080
wait,
God basically tells him,

79
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,850
look,
buddy,

80
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,990
before you go about criticizing the 
structure of reality,

81
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,000
you should look to your own 
inadequacies.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He says,
Sin Crouches at your door like a 

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,641
predatory sexually aroused animal and 
you invited it in to have its way with 

84
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,230
you and something has emerged as a 
consequence.

85
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,860
So p bothered me about my creation 
before you look to yourself,

86
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,670
so there's a very strong hint that the 
reason that God has not favor cane 

87
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:42,160
sacrifices because they weren't 
particularly good quality,

88
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,850
so but the but it is ambivalent in the 
story and there is the shepherd versus 

89
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,900
farmer Motif as well and of course that 
motif runs through the whole entire 

90
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,460
corpus of stories to some degree,
especially the shepherd motif.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So it's only about a paragraph long.
That whole story and it packs all that 

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,571
into that tiny little amount of space.
But the idea that cain kills able to get

93
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:08,830
rid of is ideal and also to punish God.
Roughly speaking.

94
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,270
It's a brilliant story.
I mean these guys who go around shooting

95
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,330
up high schools are shooting up high 
schools in particular,

96
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:21,331
but you know there are definitely out 
for revenge and what their revenging 

97
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:23,800
themselves against or to who is not 
exactly clear.

98
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,350
Anyways,
so these kids are just tearing down this

99
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:29,860
model home carrying down Western 
civilization.

100
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:33,370
I suppose it's another way of looking at
or just tearing down civilization period

101
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,650
and Pinocchio's having a pretty good 
time.

102
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:38,770
He's got his ax and he's looking a 
little malevolent there and,

103
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,390
and happy to be destroying things,
which is of course a pretty simple thing

104
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:48,391
to do.
So there's that image that I told you 

105
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:48,780
about the Mandela that's a flower in 
this image.

106
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,320
And so what happens is that,
uh,

107
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,520
I think it's lamp wick throws a brick 
through it.

108
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,030
And so what that means is this the self 
as a symbol of your potential among very

109
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:05,741
many other things,
but by engaging in this sort of 

110
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:06,740
impulsive,
destructive activity,

111
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,210
lamp,
Wick and Pinocchio,

112
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:10,820
or making it impossible for them to 
further their development.

113
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,890
And they're doing that to some degree 
consciously,

114
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:17,891
you know,
they basically say to hell with it and 

115
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:19,250
toss a brick through this highest ideal,
the thing through which light shines.

116
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,830
So also that hearkens back to the,
to the stars.

117
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,200
Well,
so.
