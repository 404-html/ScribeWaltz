1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,420
I watched this great documentary once a 
called Hitman Hart and was about Bret 

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,400
Hart who was the most famous Canadian in
the world for awhile and he was,

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,120
he was a world wide wrestling federation
wrestler,

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,150
you know,
and he was a good guy and he came from 

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,660
this famous family of wrestlers who all 
came from Alberta.

6
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:22,050
I think there were seven brothers who 
were wrestlers and seven sisters and all

7
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:25,710
of the sisters married wrestlers and 
they were all offspring.

8
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:27,200
Children of Stu Hart,
who,

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:27,810
who,
who,

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,930
who was a wrestling impresario like 40 
years ago.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,560
And it was,
it was such a cool documentary because I

12
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:38,970
was always wondering why in the world 
did people watch wrestling and,

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,050
and,
and believe it,

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,490
you know,
believe it.

15
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,100
Do you believe movies when you go watch 
them?

16
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,180
It's like,
that's a hard question to answer while 

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:49,180
you're there.
You do.

18
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,520
And so if you're watching wrestling and 
you're a wrestling fan,

19
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:51,420
do you believe it?

20
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,010
Well,
it isn't a matter of belief.

21
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:58,011
It's a matter of being engaged in a 
drama and there are different levels of 

22
00:00:58,011 --> 00:00:58,011
drama.
Right?

23
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:02,781
So let's say worldwide Wrestling 
Federation drama is not the most 

24
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:04,320
sophisticated form of drama.
Okay?

25
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,380
But I'm not being not being a smart Alec
when I'm saying that there is drama of 

26
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:14,661
different sophistication for different 
people and that's also why religious 

27
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:15,240
truths exists at multiple levels 
simultaneously.

28
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:20,241
Right?
There's got to be something in it for 

29
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:20,241
everyone and that's a hard belief 
system.

30
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:24,231
That's a hard system to put together.
Something for the unbelievably 

31
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:25,380
sophisticated and something for the 
common person.

32
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,770
Okay.
So we have wrestling and Brett Hart was 

33
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,020
a good guy and he fell into the 
archetype of being a good guy and that's

34
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:32,940
partly what the.
What the story's about.

35
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:35,280
It was a bit too much for him,
but I'm.

36
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,060
One of the things that he,
he laid out so carefully was because he 

37
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,880
figured that a hundred and $20 million 
people knew him,

38
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:43,920
something like that and that everywhere 
he went,

39
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,060
he was treated like a hero.

40
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,460
And he found that quite a bit of quite a
burden.

41
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,350
And as you can imagine,
if you think about it,

42
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,650
but he portrayed what was happening in 
the wrestling ring as classic good 

43
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,180
against evil but not conceptualized in 
disgust,

44
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,470
right?
Embodied,

45
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,090
fought out,
acted out,

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,660
you know,
like,

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,030
like the,
like thor and the hulk,

48
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:05,550
except like right in front of you.
And so,

49
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,900
well that's exactly this sort of thing.
I mean,

50
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,970
look,
we could consider hockey more 

51
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:14,970
sophisticated than wrestling perhaps.
And that has,

52
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,170
as I said,
I'm not being a critic of these.

53
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:19,170
I am not being critically minded about 
these things.

54
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:22,500
I understand their purpose and I would 
highly recommend that documentary.

55
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,660
It's a brilliant documentary,
but this is,

56
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,640
it's the same thing.
It's a Silver Cup,

57
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:31,641
right?
It's like there's the hero of the team 

58
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:31,880
that's the hero of the teams.
You know,

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,500
here's something cool if you're.

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,240
The founder of the Toronto Blue Jays are
the Toronto Maple leafs.

61
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,180
Of course this hardly ever happens to 
you if you're a fan of the Toronto Maple

62
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:43,590
leafs because they always lose.
But,

63
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,550
but,
but if you're watching a game and your 

64
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,780
team wins and we take your testosterone 
levels,

65
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,810
then they went up and if you watched the
Toronto Maple leafs and they lost and 

66
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:59,010
you're a fan than your testosterone 
levels go.

67
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,690
So that's pretty damn funny,
you know,

68
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,800
I mean really don't you see how deeply 
instantiated this as in people?

69
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,440
I mean,
it bloody well alters your biochemistry,

70
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:09,200
like your,
your,

71
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,300
your testosterone levels.
It's all my team lost,

72
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,010
you know,
it's like there'll be no,

73
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,050
there'll be nothing in it for the wife 
tonight,

74
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,380
you know?

75
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,540
Oh yeah.
