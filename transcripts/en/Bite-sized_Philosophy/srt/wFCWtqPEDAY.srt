1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,560
And I want to read you something that 
nature wrote.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,800
It's perhaps the most famous thing he 
ever said,

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,110
although it's almost entirely taken out 
of context and misquoted,

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,090
and if not,
ms dot quartered,

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,100
at least misunderstood because nature 
was one of these strange people who was 

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,560
capable of living 50 or even 100 years 
into the future,

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,710
and although he was,
is generally regarded as an enemy of 

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,791
Christianity and superstition and was 
certainly an unbelievably outspoken 

9
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:30,931
opponent of Christian traditionalism,
he also knew that if you let the old 

10
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:36,001
gods die,
the probability that blood would flood 

11
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:38,320
the land was virtually 100 percent.
So let me read you what he wrote.

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,490
Have you not heard of that?
Mad Man who lit a lantern in the bright 

13
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,730
morning hours,
ran to the market place and cried 

14
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,441
incessantly.
I seek God as many of those who do not 

15
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,670
believe in God were standing around just
then he provoked.

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,510
Must much laughter.
Why did he get lost?

17
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,570
Said one.
Did he lose his way like a child said 

18
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,150
another or is he hiding?
Is he afraid of us?

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,170
Has he gone on a voyage or immigrated?
That's the yelled and laughed.

20
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,370
The Madman jumped into their midst and 
pierced them with his glances.

21
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,230
Where there is God,
he cried.

22
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:16,360
I shall tell you,
we have killed him.

23
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,270
You and I,
all of us are as murderers,

24
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,950
but how have we done this?
How were we able to drink up the sea?

25
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,580
Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the 
entire horizon?

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,360
What did we do when we unchained this 
earth from its sun weather?

27
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,490
Is it moving now with or are we moving 
now way from all sons?

28
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,580
Are we not plunging continuously 
backwards,

29
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,210
sideward,
forward in all directions?

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Is there any opera down left?
Are we not straying as though through an

31
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:53,560
infinite nothing?

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,320
Do we not feel the breath of empty 
space?

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Has it not become colder,
is not night and more night coming on 

34
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:05,710
all the while.
Must not lanterns be lit in the morning.

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,700
Do we not hear anything yet of the noise
of the grave diggers who are burying 

36
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,301
God?
Do we not smell anything yet of God's 

37
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,170
decomposition?
God's to decompose.

38
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,080
God is dead.
God remains dead.

39
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,830
We have killed him.
How shall we,

40
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:27,460
the murderer of all murderers,
comfort ourselves?

41
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,970
What was holiest and most powerful of 
all that the world has yet owned,

42
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,440
has bled to death under our knives?
Who will wipe this blood office?

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,560
What water is there for us to clean 
ourselves?

44
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,950
What festivals of Atonement,
what sacred game show we have to invent 

45
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,240
is not the greatness of this deed too 
great for us?

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,020
Must we not ourselves become God simply 
to seem worthy of it?

47
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,090
Well,
as you can tell,

48
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,470
that's a much different notion from the 
casual God is dead quotation that's most

49
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,510
generally associated with nature.
Well,

50
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:08,170
what is he saying?
What he's saying?

51
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:13,171
Something like this system like 
Christianity or any system that's Qa,

52
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,440
that's oriented the society for 
thousands and thousands of years,

53
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,700
can't simply be eradicated by a casual 
gesture,

54
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,180
without consequences in suing and its 
aftermath.

55
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,040
What consequences will need you to says,
well,

56
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:37,270
we'll no longer know up from down.
What does he mean by that?

57
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,060
Metaphorically?
Well Up.

58
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,370
That's where you're headed,
right and down.

59
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:47,371
That's what you want to stay away from,
and when you eradicate the most 

60
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:48,400
fundamental presuppositions of your 
system,

61
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:51,370
of values,
then there is no up and there is no down

62
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:53,320
and then where are you?
Precisely.

63
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,180
Well,
it's not so easy.

64
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,190
It's not so easy to say having not 
necessarily ever been in that position.

65
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,890
What is your life like when you don't 
know up from down?

66
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:07,891
Is it merely neutral is merely no value 
left or could it possibly be the case 

67
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:10,900
that if up and down and both being 
eradicated,

68
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:15,901
that the place that you're left in is 
something much more akin to a permanent 

69
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:19,981
state of suffering because maybe it's 
only the case that the constant capacity

70
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:24,850
to thrive for up in being enough that 
you believe in.

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,510
The constant striving for up is actually
what makes your life bearable to you,

72
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:30,490
and if you lost the sense of up and 
down,

73
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,600
the place that you would end up would be
not so much neutral as terrible.

74
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,420
Now,
if you have any belief system at all,

75
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:42,421
you do this,
so let's say you're an advocate of 

76
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:44,830
leftwing politics.
You take a pro environmental stance or 

77
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,480
an anti corporate stance,
which is a relatively common thing to do

78
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:47,620
among undergraduates.

79
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,740
What do you do when you hold that belief
system?

80
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,140
You view the world as it lays itself out
and you explained the manner in which it

81
00:04:56,141 --> 00:05:01,141
manifests itself in terms of the axioms 
of that belief system and you may know 

82
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:05,700
that you can do it right.
You can tell a credible story about why 

83
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,381
the world is the way it is by adopting,
say an anti corporate perspective 

84
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,630
because there are all sorts of terrible 
things about the world that are a 

85
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:15,880
consequence say of corporate 
maneuvering,

86
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,870
and you might also say that and Piaget 
would say this,

87
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,880
that it's a necessary developmental 
stage to acquire allegiance to a given 

88
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,880
belief system.
Why?

89
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,250
Well,
any APP is better than none.

90
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:35,251
That might be the first observation,
so even if your belief system is 

91
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:39,571
relatively insufficient and easily 
challenged on intellectual grounds and 

92
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:42,841
perhaps not very complete anyways,
the fact that it does lay out a moral 

93
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:43,330
structure for you and tell you,
good for me,

94
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:44,680
evil and right from wrong.

95
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,870
That's a.
that's a plus.

96
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:51,871
That's an advantage.
Now it's relative intellectual weakness 

97
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:55,770
and it's incoherence.
Assuming it is incoherent to some 

98
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,470
degree,
that's a flaw,

99
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,710
but that mean that the effort to 
establish a system like that is 

100
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,750
worthless.
It's worthwhile and need just said,

101
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,060
say with regards to Christianity and 
Europe,

102
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,420
he said,
well,

103
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,510
the errors,
intellectual and moral of Institutional 

104
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,200
Christianity are essentially beyond 
count,

105
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,340
but there's one thing you have to 
remember.

106
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,780
First of all,
in ordering of that sort is necessary 

107
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,080
because the alternative,
which is always hidden from you in so 

108
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,591
far as you're inside a moral system,
the alternative as far worse chaos 

109
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:33,320
that's worse.
