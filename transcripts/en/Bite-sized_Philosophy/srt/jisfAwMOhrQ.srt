00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,230
Here's,
I love this cartoon,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,470
this is from a underground comic for,
for people who smoke way too much 

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,031
marijuana and it's called a.
These people are the fabulous furry 

4
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,950
freak brothers and they were created by 
Gilbert Shelton who was one of the first

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,280
underground cartoonists and one of the 
least pathological ones with the best 

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,660
sense of humor and he writes these 
stories about these stupid hippies,

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,970
three of them,
the fabulous furry freak brothers.

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,920
You see two of them there and all they 
do is smoke pot and avoid responsibility

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,240
and and run away from the police and it,
but,

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,370
but it's a nice satire and so and they 
have this cat and the fat one fat Freddy

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,610
has the cat and they're too lazy to even
give her the cat in name.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,820
So it's fat Freddy's cat and it has its 
own adventure is mostly with like an 

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,540
army of cockroaches that that lives 
inside.

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,720
They're like horrible slummy hell hole 
of living place.

15
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,880
And so anyways,
it's quite comical.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,170
And so the,
the hippies have stumbled across a small

17
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:03,470
fortune and stoned out of their minds on
cocaine.

18
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,940
They go out to set up utopia in the 
countryside.

19
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,950
They buy this terrible piece of 
property,

20
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:11,460
but they're so diluted that they think 
it's like a mansion and they bring their

21
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:13,620
cat and I don't know if you've ever had 
a cat,

22
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:18,621
but cats don't like to move.
It really bugs them and so they're not 

23
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:19,920
comfortable when you bring them to a new
place.

24
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:24,921
They're like the rat that's been taken 
out of its comfortable cage and put it 

25
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:27,891
into a new cage and the cat,
you put a cat in a new room and it 

26
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:31,220
depending on the cat obviously,
but generally they'll retreat into a 

27
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,191
corner and be and meow pityingly and be 
very unhappy for quite a substantial 

28
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:34,650
amount of time.

29
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,340
And so the cartoonist actually map this 
out quite nicely.

30
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:42,270
So the hippie takes the cat out of the 
box and says our new home,

31
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,070
it's,
they're out in the forest.

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,440
This is the never been cat.
It's never been in the forest.

33
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,150
It doesn't know what the hell is up in 
the forest.

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,700
And the cat's looking rather dubiously 
and things.

35
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:55,701
So this is the country and then it's put
on the ground and it starts to slink as 

36
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:56,190
he says,
slink,

37
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:59,640
slink out into the forest.
And that's actually what animals do.

38
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:02,250
It's a,
it's a predatory evasion crouch.

39
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,230
And so if they're put in a new 
territory,

40
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:09,231
they'll hunker down and freeze first and
then they'll slowly unfreeze and start 

41
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:15,351
to explore.
They sniff first and then they'll start 

42
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:16,050
to move it.
But they do it like with trepidation and

43
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:21,051
slowly and tried to hide it.
So that's what the cat is doing and the 

44
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:24,051
cat goes out into the unknown,
far enough sniffing and all of a sudden 

45
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:24,051
pow.

46
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:29,030
It goes underneath the house,
just like the toddler running back to 

47
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,350
the mother and the other,
another hippie there.

48
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,810
Uh,
I think that's fineas says,

49
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:38,811
where'd the cat disappeared to now?
And the fat ready character says under 

50
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:42,981
the house.
And then accounts under there in the 

51
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,391
dark with big eyes looking terrified.
Saying you'd hide too if you'd smelled 

52
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:49,011
what I did.
And so what it smelled was this thing 

53
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:52,581
that has like the head of a wolf and a 
and a and antlers like a deer in the 

54
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:56,280
tail of a skunk and the feet of a like a
chicken and horrible clause.

55
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:57,030
It's like,
well,

56
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,560
what is that?
Well,

57
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:02,350
it's a monstrous amalgam of that which 
lurks in the unknown.

58
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,730
And so the cartoonists,
the comedian got it perfect,

59
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,490
said,
well,

60
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:11,491
what is there?
What is out in the unknown while you 

61
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,640
need one representation,
not a thousand.

62
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,190
And so you take pieces of what's out 
there that are relevant and you create a

63
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,800
single image out of that and you say,
well,

64
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,870
this is what's out there.
And you might say,

65
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:27,871
well no such animal as that exists,
and that's actually incorrect.

66
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,590
An animal,
very much animals very much like that 

67
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,440
exists.
It's just a superordinate low resolution

68
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:38,560
category.
It includes all those weird animals that

69
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:40,660
might hurt you,
that are out in the forest.

70
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,380
That's a useful category,
weird animals that might hurt you.

71
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,530
And that's a real category.
You might say,

72
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:52,531
well,
there's differentiated things within 

73
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:52,531
that category.
It's like,

74
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:54,310
yeah,
every category has that nature.

75
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,240
Can still be further differentiated,
maybe not protons,

76
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,390
you know,
they could even be differentiated with 

77
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,551
regards to location at least.
So every category can be further 

78
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:06,760
differentiated.
The question is whether the category has

79
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:10,120
some functional utility,
or at least that's one of its questions.

80
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:12,520
It's like that's the thing to be afraid 
of.
