00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,460
Hi Dr Peterson,
my question is,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,330
I know you stated in the last lecture 
that the importance for setting aims in 

3
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:14,120
life and uh,
to kind of have goals,

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,450
goals to work towards.
Right?

5
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:18,010
So my question was,
um,

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:19,890
what,
where do you,

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,530
how do you do that if you don't know 
where you want to go because that's kind

8
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:28,531
of where I got stuck on your,
your future off authoring program 

9
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:28,531
because.

10
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:28,531
Okay,
that's,

11
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:30,500
that's a good question.
That's a really good question.

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,970
Um,
I think it's echoed to some degree in 

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,670
the structure of the biblical stories 
and in this manner.

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,030
So there's this notion in the Old 
Testament that morality is following a 

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,321
sequence of prohibitions.
There's a bunch of bad things you 

16
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:51,710
shouldn't do and then basically you're 
good enough and,

17
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:53,390
and,
and I think there's wisdom in that.

18
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:55,340
I think that's kind of where children 
start,

19
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:55,870
right?
You,

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,040
I mean,
I love children and all that,

21
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:03,041
but they're there,
they're crazy little creatures and they 

22
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,801
need to be civilized.
And partly what you do is you lay 

23
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:10,791
prohibitions on them and mostly what 
you're trying to do is lay prohibitions 

24
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,520
on them for the behaviors that if they 
manifested,

25
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:18,521
would make their life miserable.
So I have another chapter in this book 

26
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:21,911
that I'm writing called don't let your 
children do anything that makes you 

27
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:21,911
dislike them.

28
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:26,140
And the idea there is that your job as a
parent is to help your children become 

29
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:31,961
the sort of four year olds that adults 
genuinely smile out when they come into 

30
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:36,701
a room because that makes the entire 
social environment both truthful and 

31
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:40,541
welcoming.
And so your job is to make them 

32
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:43,870
desirable.
Social beings and lot of that is 

33
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:43,870
prohibition.
Okay?

34
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,390
There's this ethical transformation and 
it happens to some degree in the,

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,260
in the tradition of the.
In the prophetic tradition where there's

36
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,990
a spirit that seems in some sense to 
rise above the law,

37
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:58,991
but there's a real transformation 
between the old testament and the new 

38
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:00,290
testament.
The Old Testament is prohibition and the

39
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,160
New Testament is,
well,

40
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:06,161
here's the good things you do once 
you're more than merely prohibiting 

41
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:08,540
yourself from,
from impulsive sin.

42
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:12,380
Let's say there's a positive good to be 
accomplished.

43
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,280
While you might say,
well,

44
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:14,930
I don't know what the positive good is.

45
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,130
Fair enough,
man.

46
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,640
So,
so this is why this thing that I've said

47
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:21,680
to people,
it's become this crazy Internet meme,

48
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:24,810
but that's to clean up your room and 
which,

49
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,410
which is a lot better and more useful 
than people think.

50
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:29,480
It's a lot harder to.
But the thing,

51
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:30,950
the first thing you do,
I think,

52
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:35,951
and I learned this in part from 
Solzhenitsyn when he was trying to iron 

53
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:38,651
out his soul when he was in the Gulag 
because he was trying to figure out how 

54
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:39,770
we got there,
how he contributed to how we got there.

55
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,950
You know,
not Stalin and Hitler even though they 

56
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:44,950
were kind of to blame,
you know,

57
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,140
but he wasn't much he could do about 
that.

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,290
I think what you have to do,
and this is part of humility,

59
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:52,010
is you have to look around you within 
your sphere of influence,

60
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:57,011
like the direct sphere of influence and 
fix the things that announced themselves

61
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,120
as in need of repair.

62
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:04,350
And those are often small things you 
know and they can be like your room,

63
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,750
put it in order because the thing is,
it isn't exactly so important that your 

64
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,240
room is an order,
although it is.

65
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,540
What's important is that you learn how 
to distinguish between chaos and order 

66
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,040
and to be able to act in a manner that 
produces order.

67
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:23,190
And in most households there's 100 
things that could be done to just make 

68
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,211
it less hideous and horrible.
And so practicing that is a real useful 

69
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,200
form of meditation.
And it's also,

70
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,530
it's also,
I think it's a divine act because you're

71
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:36,400
taking chaos and you know,
if you pay attention even to a room,

72
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,040
it's so interesting.
And I learned because I've,

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,050
I've renovated many places now and tried
to make them beautiful.

74
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:46,051
And one of the things that I've really 
learned is that even if you own a 

75
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:49,411
structure,
unless you investigated all the nooks 

76
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:53,131
and crannies and cleaned them up and put
your own imprint on them and made the 

77
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:54,160
mirrors,
they're not yours.

78
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,430
The mere fact of physical ownership 
doesn't make them yours.

79
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:02,431
You have to establish a dynamic 
relationship with the objects before 

80
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:04,450
they're actually years and I think you 
can.

81
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,360
You can do something as simple as just 
sit on your bed and think,

82
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:12,361
okay,
there's probably like five things I 

83
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:14,791
could do today so that tomorrow morning 
is slightly better than this morning was

84
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:16,660
at least,
or at least I'm not falling behind.

85
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,170
And those will usually be like heavy 
data toad in the morning.

86
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:20,800
Right?
It's like,

87
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,420
it's not going to be something you want 
to do.

88
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,920
There'll be things you're trying to 
avoid.

89
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,030
There are snakes essentially,
but if you ask yourself like you're 

90
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,280
asking someone,
which I think is a form of prayer,

91
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,130
if you ask yourself,
instead of telling yourself,

92
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,860
you know,
what is it that I could do to set things

93
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:40,390
more right today that I would actually 
do?

94
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,030
It's usually some small thing because 
you're not that disciplined,

95
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:48,031
you know?
Then you can go do it and then you put 

96
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:51,160
the world together a little more.
When you do that and that spreads out,

97
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,580
but you also put your.
You also construct yourself into 

98
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,800
something that's better able to call 
order forth from chaos,

99
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,980
and that makes you just incrementally 
stronger and then the next day you can 

100
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:10,111
maybe take on a slightly larger task and
like you get the benefit of compound 

101
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:10,960
interest.
If you do that,

102
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:15,961
it's a tremendously powerful technique 
and they think if you do that at some 

103
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:20,251
point,
instead of just having to fix things up 

104
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:23,760
that are not good,
you'll start to get a glimmer of the 

105
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,160
positive things that you could do.
You know,

106
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,270
the positive things that you could do 
that would actually constitute a vision 

107
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,090
and that that's what I would recommend.
Thank you.

108
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,030
Good night.
You.
