1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,350
Uh,
the first one I say,

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,710
from my understanding,
the essential problems with epistemology

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,980
derive from the nature of language and 
axioms upon which various underlying 

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,380
linguistic structures are based.
And then afterwards interpreted,

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,780
as you have said in your videos,
the probability that you construe some 

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,320
of the same definitions of insert random
word,

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,150
person says,
and in the same way are virtually zero,

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,040
or one of the best examples I can give 
for this is the language that is used in

9
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:35,061
physics.
It is widely misconstrued as the 

10
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:38,811
pragmatic meanings behind words and 
their contexts are worlds debased from 

11
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:41,640
the vague linguistic constructed views 
of the actual linguistic,

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,630
uh,
definitions that people construe so,

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,670
such as the problem with the word 
dimension,

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,270
dimension in which it is understood in 
the semantic sense,

15
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:53,630
but not in an abstract sense in which 
the word is implied.

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,450
The first chapter of Einstein's theory 
of special and general relativity,

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,050
Einstein stresses that geometry is an 
abstract model.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,380
Time per se is not the dimension.
The theory of special relativity merely 

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,510
treats any one clock time as dimension 
of an abstract construct.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,500
So for the next three questions I have,
I want this to be considered as a means 

21
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:17,430
of,

22
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,290
okay,
so,

23
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,530
so my answer to that,
fundamentally I think the best answer to

24
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:26,531
that was provided by the American 
pragmatists and that'd be William James 

25
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:30,191
and his crew.
That would include guiding her pierce P 

26
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:34,240
I e R,
c e m who was perhaps the,

27
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,670
you know,
the best floors for the American,

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,060
the US ever produced cns pierce,
but somewhat under appreciated and 

29
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,540
certainly so in his own life.
Part of the way that different people 

30
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,330
hone in on the same definition is to 
define what an acceptable outcome would 

31
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:58,721
be to their joint interactions and then 
to hone their language until they 

32
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:01,460
achieve that outcome.
And then to consider that good enough.

33
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,450
I would say pearson,
his crew basically said that you could 

34
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:08,450
never do anything better than that.
So let's say that we're trying to.

35
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,550
Let's say we're trying to communicate 
about how we're going to move a 

36
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,300
wheelbarrow full of bricks from one side
of the yard to the other.

37
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,020
Well,
basically what we've decided is we've 

38
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,050
communicated good enough if the bricks 
get moved.

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,200
And so,
so what you have to do is you have to 

40
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,121
set up a practical surround in some 
sense around your conversation and the 

41
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,870
practical surround constitutes what you 
are willing to consider as proof that 

42
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:45,380
conversation or that communication has 
taken place sufficiently.

43
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,930
I mean that's partly,
it's complicated and it's partly why the

44
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,940
robotics engineers tried,
like Rodney Brooks were discovered back 

45
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,541
in the 19 eighties that you really 
couldn't have intelligent machines 

46
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:02,201
without embodiment because you need a 
real world target against which to 

47
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:07,330
measure the effectiveness of your 
communication.

48
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,630
Because as you said,
I mean this is where the postmodern is 

49
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,700
to have it right,
is that there is a lot of different ways

50
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:17,701
of interpreting everything.
So how do you know when your 

51
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:20,191
interpretation is good enough?
And the answer to that is you agree a 

52
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:21,880
priority.
What would constitute good enough?

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,550
And when you hit that target,
then you're done.

54
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,190
Oh,
thank you.

55
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:27,830
And I'll look into CSPS.

56
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,630
Yep.
Cs Paris.

57
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,320
Yep.
Yeah.

58
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,790
Look up the American pragmatists and go 
to bright man.

59
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,190
Alright.
And then so,

60
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,290
and then the next one is on 
transgenderism and conservative.

61
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:47,291
Strongly boast of biological and 
scientific claim of two genders or two 

62
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,440
sexes based on what language we're going
to use.

63
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,210
Um,
they believe and I believe,

64
00:03:50,211 --> 00:03:55,211
right,
fully so in biological differences 

65
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:57,761
between males and females,
but I've never heard a liberal argue and

66
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,550
from my perspective,
I think I could partially combat this,

67
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,780
but it's an argument that hasn't been 
raised from the liberal side,

68
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:07,610
which I think should have,
um,

69
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,820
biological differences in the brain.
Women can see more shades of color on 

70
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,970
average and men can have better spatial 
orientation.

71
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:15,580
On average.
I'm Steven.

72
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,410
There's massive neurological and 
biological differences between women are

73
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,420
well documented,
but the postmodernist types just assume 

74
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,701
that the scientist who conducted the 
investigations are suffering from the 

75
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:30,920
same bias that they think permeates 
everything else.

76
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:32,030
So they just discounted.

77
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,260
Yes.
So is it,

78
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,320
is it really crazy to believe that 
someone could be born with biological 

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,750
similarities to an x,
y,

80
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,910
brain and biological?
Excellent.

81
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,320
Not at all.
Not at all.

82
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,100
No.
That is the argument that I'm making.

83
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,640
The argument I'm making is that gender 
identity is strongly influenced by 

84
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,030
biological sex.
The problem is is that the legislation,

85
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:57,670
especially the legislation that's being 
introduced in Canada,

86
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,570
argues that it's not.
That's just not helpful.

87
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:04,690
It's not even helpful for the 
transgendered types because some of them

88
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:09,691
for sure,
there are people who have mixed 

89
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:11,551
biological sex women who have some cells
in their body that have male 

90
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:15,490
chromosomes,
trivial number for example,

91
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:20,491
and there are people who are born with 
genitalia that are identifiable and 

92
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:22,810
there are more genuine hermaphroditic 
types and there is no different,

93
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:27,811
no doubt that there are some men that 
have a more feminine personality 

94
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:30,400
structure in some women that have a more
masculine personality structure and then

95
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,910
that's biologically influenced.
So I would separate.

96
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,210
I'm not making a biological case that 
there are two genders that end.

97
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,140
Okay.
Thank you.

98
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,850
I'm making a biological.
I'm making a case that sexual identity 

99
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:51,991
has been unbelievably powerfully 
influenced by biology with certain 

100
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:56,551
exceptions and those exceptions 
themselves might be biologically 

101
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:57,160
determined.
Not In all cases but in many.

102
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,650
And so part of the reason I was 
objecting to legislation like bill 

103
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,461
[inaudible] is because it insists that 
gender identity is socially constructed 

104
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:11,290
well.
If gender identity is socially 

105
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,181
constructed,
then why can't we just take transgender 

106
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:13,181
people and socialize them back into 
their.

107
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:15,710
Into their normative sex roles?
Exactly.

108
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,940
Right.
Exactly.

109
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:19,520
So that's part of the reason I was 
objecting to the legislation.

110
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,000
One of the most powerful arguments,
and I said this,

111
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:26,000
I did a presentation in front of the 
Canadian Senate.

112
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,390
I don't know if you saw that or not.
There's no reason for you to have paid 

113
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,601
attention to it,
but if you look up Jordan Peterson and 

114
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:37,691
Senate,
you'll see that as well along with a 

115
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:39,590
professor along with a practicing 
lawyer.

116
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,590
I made exactly that case to a number of 
Canadian senators telling them that by 

117
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,270
supporting this legislation,
they were actually doing a disservice to

118
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:49,130
the people that they purport to be 
helping.

119
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,560
So that's,
that's it,

120
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:54,110
isn't that biologically there are two 
sexes,

121
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,260
although a pr as an approximation.
That's true.

122
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,570
As a decent approximation.
It's true.

123
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,840
It gets slightly messy because we're our
multiplicity of ways than sexuality and 

124
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,600
sex differences manifest themselves and 
those a fair bit of variability across 

125
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:13,760
all of those different manifestations.
And so,

126
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,150
as I said,
you can have feminine man and a 

127
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,181
Masculine Male,
masculine woman that happens very 

128
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:21,181
frequently.
Um,

129
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:24,710
it's just more often you have a feminine
woman and a masculine man.

130
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,500
Alright,
that perfectly explains my question.

131
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,740
Okay.
So next postmodern is thought,

132
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:34,950
and I think you kind of already talked 
about this,

133
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,800
um,
when you said the American postmodernist

134
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,850
got this right.
And that I'm going to summarize very 

135
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,450
quickly because you've already answered,
but like,

136
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,770
um,
you say that you see scientific realism 

137
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,731
is nested in Darwinian competition.
And so it's reasonably objective that 

138
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,410
the,

139
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,320
oh no,
no,

140
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,330
that's not quite right.
I would say that it isn't obvious to me 

141
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:08,451
that there is any truth that,
that is super ordinary to,

142
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,360
to the truth.
It's established in the Darwinian 

143
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,360
fashion.
And that includes our notion of,

144
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,350
of objective reality.
Now that's where Sam Harris and I had a 

145
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,820
major disagreement,
but again,

146
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:22,620
it has,
it's a consequence of,

147
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,650
of my pragmatic thinking.
You see the Darwinian claim 

148
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,981
fundamentally is that the only way that 
you can come up with a definition of 

149
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:35,931
truth is throwing an evolutionary model 
that uses death as the punishment being 

150
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,660
wrong.
And so one of the things I was arguing 

151
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,621
with with Sam Harris about is whether or
not our current conceptualizations of 

152
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:49,050
objective truth are necessarily true in 
a Darwinian sense,

153
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,230
and if they're not,
which form of truth should take 

154
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,781
priority.
And I was arguing the Darwinian truth 

155
00:08:56,781 --> 00:08:58,200
should take priority and Sam was arguing
that,

156
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,380
well,
well he didn't particularly like that 

157
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,820
stamps,
although one of the law.

158
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,270
And that's basically what our argument,
what argument circulated around.

159
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,180
So.
So the problem is,

160
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,070
see the problem is,
is that we never know.

161
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,170
Let's see,
what's the problem?

162
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:21,171
Exactly.
Even our objective truth is seriously 

163
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:22,440
bounded in ways that we don't 
understand.

164
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,310
Claim claim it as at any given moment as
having some sort of fundamental 

165
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:33,441
ontological status outside of it's 
Darwinian utility strikes me as 

166
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:37,551
dangerous,
especially given how trans mutable 

167
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:37,551
scientific theories tend to be.

168
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,780
So let's,
if I'm going to oversimplify things,

169
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,740
liberals tend to think with the anterior
cingulate cortex of the brain with 

170
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,800
future applications,
possibilities,

171
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:52,801
likeliness consequences in conservative 
part of the brain that's involved in 

172
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,700
social cognition name and conservatives 
tend to trust it.

173
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,200
So,
um,

174
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,850
yeah,
I'm going to read what I wrote here.

175
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:08,030
For example,
low populations in rural areas would 

176
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,750
potentially possess more views of self 
photometry,

177
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:11,460
working hard,
family values,

178
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:13,500
increasing population,
protecting oneself,

179
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,660
and one's kind due to the types of 
motivations and the hypothalamus being 

180
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,251
more applicable to survival while highly
populated areas would focus potentially 

181
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:25,440
more on thinking tolerance,
community values,

182
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:28,800
stabilizing population,
but additionally might not focus so much

183
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:33,801
on protecting life or raising children.
These differences could explain vastly 

184
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:37,881
the moral behaviors being ideally are 
objectively true based on incalculable 

185
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:37,920
variables.

186
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,360
So a better run.
Run that through me.

187
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,880
Again,
it's quite complicated.

188
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,940
Yes it is.
So I am suggesting that if we are to 

189
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,130
look at a,
a reason why,

190
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,270
how people think,
we can look at how people think as being

191
00:10:56,271 --> 00:11:00,580
nested in Darwinian competition.
So,

192
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,160
so if,
if there's a low populated area you 

193
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,350
would think,
okay,

194
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:10,900
what traits incalculable,
but some somewhat telltale global trends

195
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,940
would be unnecessary for them to be 
raised and what traits mostly in the 

196
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,411
hypothalamus I'm assuming and what 
traits would be more applicable for a 

197
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:25,001
large city.
So it's almost completely possible that 

198
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,840
the politics of liberals is perfect for 
their situation in a big city,

199
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:29,060
in the politics of conservatives as.
Yeah,

200
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,480
this is one that you should think about.
It is,

201
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,780
it isn't.
It's a reasonable hypothesis.

202
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,050
I'd have to think it through a long time
before,

203
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,600
before because you're suggesting that a 
conservative philosophy is more useful 

204
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:44,600
in a.

205
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,480
yeah,
low populated area.

206
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,040
Possibly.
Yeah.

207
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,420
It's possible.
I think.

208
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:53,150
I don't know.
It's worth thinking.

209
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,630
All right.
That's because I've been thinking about 

210
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:58,630
that a lot.
That's my main.

211
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,980
The main thing I think about,
um,

212
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,930
and I'm not saying necessarily directly 
that,

213
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,900
but at least the possibility of.
That's why

214
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,080
one thing you could do just to,
to some degree to begin with is just run

215
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:14,220
a correlation between size of the 
community and,

216
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,700
and uh,
and political proclivity you should go 

217
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,190
get that data on the light online 
wouldn't be approved because it might be

218
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,820
the more liberal types are also more 
likely to move to the cities,

219
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,850
right?
In this case you'd be leading 

220
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,191
conservatives be hard and it's not 
because they're more well adopted by 

221
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:39,051
even then it might be because they're 
more well adapted into smaller 

222
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:39,051
communities.
It's a good idea.

223
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,250
I don't know what think of it,
but it's worth thinking about.

224
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,650
Um,
and we actually have that data just 

225
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,571
through political polls and you'll see 
whenever you look at a map it's all red 

226
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:53,560
because the red is in the smaller areas 
and the blue looks small because it was 

227
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,690
more people there.
So it does

228
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,900
tendon,
it's a plausible hypothesis.

229
00:12:57,901 --> 00:13:02,901
It might be interesting to look in the 
red states only and see if it's still 

230
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:02,901
true there.

231
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:04,180
Yes.
Alright.

232
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,780
So thank you for that.
I mean it's,

233
00:13:05,781 --> 00:13:07,070
let that you,
um,

234
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,650
think of that as a possibility.
And then one last question on religion,

235
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,670
and I've been watching your,
um,

236
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,530
your psychological interpretations of 
the Bible as well as I have read the 

237
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,490
maps of meaning.
Um,

238
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,510
so I may have missed something there.
Um,

239
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,180
but this question,
so neurophysiologically to my 

240
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,861
understanding,
the way the human brain is constructed 

241
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:37,291
is such that happiness is achieved in 
the pursuit of a noble aim rather than 

242
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:40,210
the team of the goal itself.
You've talked about this multiple times.

243
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,060
Yeah,
yeah,

244
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,790
yeah.
That,

245
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,110
it's not even,
it's not happiness precisely,

246
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:50,111
but that'll do.
It's more like a sense of meaningful 

247
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:50,111
engagement,
which I think is better than happiness,

248
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:51,680
but that's okay.
We can go with happiness for now.

249
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,630
All right.
So if,

250
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,750
if there's no noble aim,
we are limited to simple pleasures which

251
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,670
do not sustain sustainable.

252
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,190
That's exactly right.
You're limited to impulsive pleasures.

253
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:05,191
Yes.
And those are ones that don't 

254
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:05,191
necessarily have a good medium to 
longterm outcome.

255
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:10,120
So if I am to take a psychological or 
more of you or moral view of biblical 

256
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,290
teaching,
like the scientific view,

257
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,760
um,
is,

258
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,880
am I right in construing that the idea 
of external happiness without suffering 

259
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:24,340
exists as a brilliantly thought out 
construct which invokes a sense of 

260
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,180
purpose and happiness.
And if I am to make that conclusion,

261
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:31,780
can I see those concepts in the moral 
psychology of the Bible as manipulative 

262
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,970
or does the defiance of natural law rule
out a literal interpretation?

263
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,300
Okay,
go back.

264
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,080
Read that again.

265
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,290
So if I,
if I'm to assume all of this with heaven

266
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:49,291
and hell,
and is it an eternal happiness is 

267
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,960
that's.
Can you see that as manipulative as like

268
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,140
you can.
I mean certainly marks did.

269
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,150
I would say Freud did as well.
One of the problem,

270
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,140
because for the thought of a religion 
as,

271
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,920
let's call it both manipulated the vim 
and immature because it burned people 

272
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,200
the certainty of life after death.
And it allowed them the comfort of 

273
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,650
knowing that an all seeing father was 
watching over them.

274
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,790
Okay.
And for,

275
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,680
I'd regard that,
let's say as immature and manipulative,

276
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,690
but he didn't have a good explanation 
for why people came up with the idea of 

277
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,840
hell because if you were just going to 
go for immature and manipulative,

278
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,250
it might as well be all positive,
right?

279
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,940
Why put the negative in there?
And you could say skeptically,

280
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:43,941
well hell is where you put your enemies.
But that's a really cynical 

281
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:46,440
interpretation because many religious 
people and now certainly even,

282
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,590
but certainly throughout the Middle Ages
were terrified that hell was something 

283
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,750
that they were headed to do.

284
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,750
Not the random is we're going to.
So I don't think that that's a 

285
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:56,940
reasonable interpretation.
Historically.

286
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:02,330
I know mark's would say that the,
that religion was when do whatever it 

287
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,940
could to manipulate people so that the 
power structure is the economic power 

288
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,350
structures can stay in place.
But um,

289
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,490
given that religion,
religious structures,

290
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:16,580
and this is,
I would say particularly but not only 

291
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,281
true of Christianity,
have played a tremendous role in giving 

292
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:21,840
additional voice to the people who are 
downtrodden and slaved.

293
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,320
That that also was a historically 
that's,

294
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,790
that's not a historic,
incredible argument.

295
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Sometimes religious teachings are used 
to buttress the people who are in 

296
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,330
control and sometimes they're used to 
oppose them.

297
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:36,600
So I don't mind that for a second.
And then.

298
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,620
So no,
I don't think the manipulation argument 

299
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:42,620
is,
I don't think it's a credible one.

300
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,710
I mean,
I understand it and I'm an admirer of 

301
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,710
Freud,
you know,

302
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,710
but I think he got wrong.

303
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,590
I think he walked out wrong and that was
certainly one of the places that he 

304
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,020
disagreed most profoundly with Carla Yom
and I think only came out of it right in

305
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:57,270
Freud came out of it wrong.
Um,

306
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,060
and then I think the Marxist critique of
religion,

307
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,710
it's just like every other Marxist 
critique.

308
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:02,310
It's like,
yeah,

309
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:04,470
yeah,
you can treat religious religion,

310
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,960
religious structures is if they're 
oppressive.

311
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:09,840
Power structure is only,
but you know,

312
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,500
it is just a reduction of a 
multidimensional complexity to a,

313
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,560
to a relatively predictable 
unidimensional dimensional in a 

314
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,810
dimensional phenomenon.
It's not helpful.

315
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,930
It's not unhelpful.
Intellectual exercise passed its 

316
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:26,930
immediate self evidence,
you know,

317
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,330
because the self evidence is some 
religious people are corrupt.

318
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,260
So like,
yeah,

319
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,660
right.
Obviously

320
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,170
that,
that's fair.

321
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,230
And given the I'm taking,
I'm taking one concept heaven way out of

322
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:44,500
context of a huge bundle of things.
So that's,

323
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,320
yeah,
there's a writer named,

324
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:48,110
um,
I should tell you about this guy,

325
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,820
Jeffrey Burton,
Russell,

326
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,040
Jeffrey Burton,
Russell.

327
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,830
You'd like him?
Yeah.

328
00:17:55,831 --> 00:18:00,831
He's written a couple of books on heaven
and a very good series on the devil as a

329
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:06,531
historian.
So he's a historian of the idea of 

330
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:09,261
heaven and the idea of the devil.
So we had three volume series on the 

331
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:10,080
devil.
What is Mephistopheles,

332
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,680
which I think is the best one,
but if you're interested in,

333
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,410
in that kind of idea,
Jeffrey Burton,

334
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:18,710
Russell is a good person to,
to take a look at.

335
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,470
He's credible,
credible historian.

336
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:24,750
And I think his books are extremely 
interesting,

337
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,330
so good.
And he delves into the idea of heaven in

338
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:30,780
a much more fundamental way than,
than the typical.

339
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,080
Especially the typical sort of cowardly 
religious critical postmodern is to 

340
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:39,510
always assume that there's nothing to it
except power dynamics.

341
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,690
It's foolish because having a minimum is
a vision of a better future even even as

342
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,410
even as only that.

343
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,450
It's by no means trivial.
I mean,

344
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,600
human beings are about the only 
creatures that can imagine a better 

345
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
future and so heaven is like the 
architects will better future.

346
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,870
Yes.
So you don't want to just demolish that 

347
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,110
idea too casually because we're always 
working.

348
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,380
Unless we're pathological,
we're always working for a better 

349
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:09,380
future.
So.

350
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,360
And to think of heaven is the idea that 
sort of shining behind that,

351
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:12,820
the,
you know,

352
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,750
the,
the implied tonic ideal of the idea of a

353
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:20,751
better future,
that's a perfectly reasonable thing to 

354
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:23,661
think.
If you don't want to just throw it away 

355
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:24,510
that that'd be throwing away one of the 
greatest ideas of mankind.

356
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,720
And that doesn't mean I think the people
should be politically utopians.

357
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,770
It's not the same thing.

358
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,370
Yes,
it's the,

359
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:35,430
it's the concept that,
that has the psychological effects on 

360
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,430
the way people behave.

361
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,200
Yeah.
Well,

362
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,850
you know,
it's right.

363
00:19:37,851 --> 00:19:42,851
And it's the concept that some value,
like I think the difference between the 

364
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:46,061
Christian idea of having an political 
utopian idea of having is that for 

365
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,920
Christians having is what would be 
achieved through the use of truth,

366
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,540
individual truth,
and for the political utopian would be 

367
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,810
as a consequence of the instantiation of
some particular political system.

368
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,520
The same thing at all.

369
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,850
All right.
And then we have about 10 more minutes 

370
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:04,850
by my time.
Yep.

371
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,730
So,
uh,

372
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,940
you answered those questions.
They're really good question.

373
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,200
Thank you.
Um,

374
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,350
I spent a long time thinking which to 
ask because obviously there's a million 

375
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:16,690
questions.
You're one that the only people I've had

376
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:19,180
faith in that could answer some of the 
questions I've had.

377
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,650
So what do you do?
Um,

378
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,820
I,
I like to think of myself as a 

379
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:26,820
philosopher.
Socrates.

380
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,070
I am a student.
I go in and out of school.

381
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:34,920
I tend to make money when I need to.
Doing our jobs in green day.

382
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,190
Like I don't have a lot of value on 
society.

383
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:39,940
Societies.

384
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,120
What are your future plans?

385
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,170
I want to go into academia.
I want to do research.

386
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,310
Well,
you're pretty smart.

387
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,480
You know,
that's a good plan.

388
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,580
Those are good questions.
Um,

389
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,840
I,
it's school is expensive in the types of

390
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:58,780
schools that I,
I go to were kind of boring.

391
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,730
I like if I could go to your class every
day,

392
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,850
I would be the happiest person ever.
Um,

393
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,570
but the,
the type of teachers,

394
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,580
not that they're not intelligent,
they're just not a Sam Harris or Neil 

395
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,100
degrasse Tyson or a Jordan Peterson.
I spent a lot of time reading,

396
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,710
reading through Einstein over and over 
again,

397
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:21,340
reading through our,
listening to Neil degrasse Tyson.

398
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,900
I liked learning.
I just,

399
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,610
the university doesn't give me,
um,

400
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,120
substantial means of learning.
I don't feel like I learned much.

401
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,400
I get the picture.
I get the picture.

402
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,620
It's a problem that you've got is that 
there's some utility in credentials.

403
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:46,390
So you know,
there's always the possibility of going 

404
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,360
to university for the credentials and 
educating yourself at the same time what

405
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,910
you really have to do if you go to 
university anyways.

406
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,130
I know it's a,
but you know,

407
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,760
it's always an uncomfortable meld 
between what you want and what should be

408
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:56,960
and what you can get.

409
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,440
Yes.
Mark Twain says,

410
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:01,500
I never let my schooling interfere with 
my education.

411
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,230
Well,
right.

412
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,140
Yes,
exactly.

413
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,580
That's perfect.
Yes.

414
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,370
So that's what I'm doing.
I have a couple of semesters left.

415
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,980
Uh,
the problem is I don't know.

416
00:22:09,981 --> 00:22:12,800
I,
I have a couple of semesters left.

417
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:16,490
I go to the University of Michigan.
The problem is my motivation,

418
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,900
um,
which I've watched a lot of the videos 

419
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,981
on your motivation.
I can't find the motivation to do the 

420
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:27,521
work if I was at Harvard or Princeton or
Yale or somewhere where I was 

421
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:27,710
challenged,
where I would be like,

422
00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:29,230
this is a huge opportunity for me.

423
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:33,150
I'm going to build the judge for 
yourself somehow.

424
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,420
Have you done the future?
The what program?

425
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,400
Future authoring program?

426
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,000
Um,
I,

427
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,010
I have done that.
Yes.

428
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,900
I think I was too focused subconsciously
with the reasons why it would help,

429
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,990
um,
determining why,

430
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:58,050
why this would help me.
It's helping me because of this is 

431
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,650
helping me because of that in kind of 
like playing mind games with myself,

432
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,770
making it so it didn't really help me as
much.

433
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,850
Yeah,
yeah,

434
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:04,510
yeah.
Well,

435
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,670
because you know,
the fact is,

436
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,610
given,
given your level of,

437
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,520
let's say again to you,
you would have to have a pretty good 

438
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,600
goal to,
to know it's not atypical for someone to

439
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:19,360
be very smart and very open,
but not very conscientious.

440
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,660
And I don't know if you're not very 
conscientious,

441
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,870
maybe you are,
but what you said so far suggests that 

442
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,390
you're higher in openness and lowering 
conscientiousness.

443
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,770
What,
what you need to rectify that if you're,

444
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,820
if you can rectify it,
is this suitably lofty goal and so,

445
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,120
and,
but,

446
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,260
but if you didn't do the future 
authoring program in a manner that 

447
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,890
helped you establish that goal,
it probably isn't going to help you.

448
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,300
Like,
do you obviously need to reason and fair

449
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,050
enough,
you know.

450
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,680
So I guess my goal would to be going to 
Grad school at an Ivy League college.

451
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,160
I would.
Cool.

452
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,150
And I'll have to.
I mean,

453
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:00,740
at one point I,
uh,

454
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,400
I wrote a letter to like basically 
everybody that works at the Harvard 

455
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:07,910
admissions,
my finding the,

456
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,230
uh,
the,

457
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:12,110
uh,
the emails and,

458
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,280
and like sent a letter explaining my 
situation,

459
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:21,281
my family situation.
Why I didn't get good grades in high 

460
00:24:21,281 --> 00:24:23,981
school,
why I've never been on a typical good 

461
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:26,711
student,
but I have a large drive and motivation 

462
00:24:26,711 --> 00:24:29,921
to learn and I know every single 
professor at Harvard and I'm familiar 

463
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:31,940
with their work.
I've read their abstracts in their,

464
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:33,110
uh,
in their journals.

465
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:34,550
Not every single one,
maybe exaggerating,

466
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,850
but I'm very familiar and with Yale too.
And why did they go into linguistics and

467
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:44,090
I never got a response back and I kind 
of just sunk back into my,

468
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,270
my read and ignore the,
uh,

469
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,720
the universe type of thing,
but they definitely where I need to set 

470
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,951
a goal and not sink back into my 
behavior like central drift,

471
00:24:57,051 --> 00:24:58,400
but actually go towards that goal.

472
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,680
Yep.
Well,

473
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:05,681
you know,
you have a good goal to go to Grad who 

474
00:25:05,681 --> 00:25:07,881
are incredible graduate school and to 
pursue an academic career as a good 

475
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,811
goal,
but you also might want to really think 

476
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:13,601
hard about what the hell you're going to
do if that doesn't happen because you 

477
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,380
know,
you're kind of built for it.

478
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,000
So it'd be a good pursuit.
And you know,

479
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:23,450
you sound like the kind of guy who could
use a phd so.

480
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:24,890
Well,
your questions were smart,

481
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,920
you know,
I had to listen to them heart and you 

482
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:29,920
thought about them a lot and they were 
sophisticated,

483
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:29,920
so,
um,

484
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,700
you know,
and that puts you in the top one percent

485
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,260
of students,
probably something like that,

486
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,500
something like that,
one to five percent.

487
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,380
And so you've got the right kind of mind
for it.

488
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:47,381
And with a mind like that,
you also really want to get yourself 

489
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:47,720
disciplined because,
um,

490
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,640
it's also safer if you have a mind like 
yours to get disciplined because the 

491
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,160
problem with a mind like yours isn't,
it'll,

492
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,360
it'll,
it'll,

493
00:25:56,361 --> 00:25:58,610
uh,
you'll be chasing it everywhere.

494
00:25:58,611 --> 00:26:01,760
Like someone with annealed a badly 
trained bloodhound.

495
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,630
Yeah.

496
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:04,920
Yeah.
And that's,

497
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,210
that can be really hard on a person over
time,

498
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:12,211
you know,
because it's easy to be one of those 

499
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:14,461
people that has a tremendous amount of 
potential but doesn't have it realized 

500
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:16,240
and why that's a rough life by the time 
you're about 40.

501
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,730
Yes.
I'm also,

502
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:22,731
what is a linguistically defined as a 
polymath where academia is one interest 

503
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:28,050
that I'm showing you right now because 
you're an academic,

504
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:33,290
but I have a wide variety of interests 
like music,

505
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,350
art.

506
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,150
Yeah.
Well that's,

507
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,820
that's where my thinking fitness

508
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,180
is high.
So I do have other opportunity,

509
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,250
you know,
childish Donald Glover,

510
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,200
he is a,
he's a rapper and I'm a standup comedian

511
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,320
and he's writing deadpool.
He's done.

512
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,050
Yes.
He's very,

513
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:02,220
very identify a lot with him looking at 
him as a role model.

514
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,090
He does a lot of different things and he
were,

515
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,210
I don't know,
his,

516
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:12,260
the profanity in his work makes it 
discredits his talent by a lot of 

517
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:15,690
people.
But like so did,

518
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:17,340
um,
Shakespeare,

519
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:22,490
I mean basically what the things he says
is witty and punny and a pro,

520
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,770
a profane of course,
but so is Shakespeare,

521
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:30,000
you know,
for the time.

522
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,310
But I identify a lot with him.

523
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,640
Well,
I'm afraid I have to bring on someone 

524
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:38,950
else's right up here,
but.
