1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,910
The two on the left are Jonah,
Jonah,

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,910
and the whale.
So the story of Jonah is an interesting 

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:09,910
one.
Oh,

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,480
I'll just go over it very briefly.
There's a city and the city is full of 

5
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:17,420
people who are sinful.
What does that mean?

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,430
Well,
to sin is an archery term.

7
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:24,431
It means to miss the mark.
So these are people who aren't oriented 

8
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:27,131
properly and so the city is in a chaotic
state and God tells Jonah that he's 

9
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:29,900
going to go to that city and tell them 
just exactly what's up with them.

10
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:30,620
And Joanie,
thanks.

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,760
No,
I'm not going to do that.

12
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:34,520
And why?
Well,

13
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,180
that doesn't require much explanation.
It's like how popular you are going to 

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,211
be if you go to a city full of chaotic 
people and tell them why they're stupid 

15
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:44,930
did wrong.
It's Joanna.

16
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:45,500
Thanks.
No,

17
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:50,501
I'm not going to do that.
I don't care if God's telling me to do 

18
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:50,501
it.

19
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:53,320
So his conscience is telling him to do 
it or his destiny is telling them to do 

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,651
it or,
or his orientation with higher morality 

21
00:00:56,651 --> 00:00:57,470
is telling them to do it.
You can read it any way you want,

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,620
and so he thinks,
no,

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,880
I'm harping on this boat and I'm getting
as far away from that city as I possibly

24
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:06,881
can,
and so he does that and then the storm 

25
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:06,920
comes up because God thinks,
no,

26
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,380
you're not getting away.
If I told you to do something,

27
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:11,870
you're not getting away from it.
A storm comes up.

28
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,310
Well,
what does that mean?

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,330
Well,
it's easy.

30
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,070
Betray your destiny and see how long it 
takes you to be.

31
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,970
Drowning in a storm

32
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,640
will happen immediately,
and of course it will,

33
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:33,641
because what?
What's calling you to be your best is 

34
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:34,340
exactly the thing that's pushing you 
forward,

35
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:36,770
to manifest yourself most fully in the 
world.

36
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,080
It's what you need.
You run away from that.

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,500
The boat's going to start to rock very,
very quickly.

38
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,320
When you all know that you know that 
perfectly well,

39
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:45,620
it,
it,

40
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:50,710
it's hell.
All you have to do is not study for an 

41
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,950
exam that you know that's coming up to 
see everything.

42
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:55,040
Start to the storm.
Water start to rise and everything start

43
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,260
to rock.
It's pretty bloody obvious.

44
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,380
So anyways,
he's on this boat and there's a storm 

45
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,410
and all of the people on the boat who 
who can't quite discriminate chaos from 

46
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:09,530
whether because they haven't 
differentiated the world to that degree,

47
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:14,531
thank.
Oh the boat wouldn't be about to be 

48
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:14,531
swamped if we hadn't.

49
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:18,890
Some of us had done something stupid and
wrong and there's logic in that,

50
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:19,760
you know,
you might think,

51
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:22,940
well God has nothing personal against 
you because of the storm,

52
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:26,600
so you're confusing levels of analysis,
but you've got to give these people some

53
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:31,601
credit.
So like maybe they didn't do something 

54
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:33,911
stupid,
maybe they didn't caulk the damn boat 

55
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:36,251
properly.
Maybe the ropes aren't in as good as 

56
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:38,711
shape as they might be.
Maybe they weren't paying attention to 

57
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:38,711
the weather when they went out on the 
ocean,

58
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:43,390
you know?
Or maybe they haven't made peace with 

59
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:43,390
their brother and so their hearts are 
bent,

60
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,830
twisted out of shape.
So they don't make particularly good 

61
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,441
sailors.
It's like the idea that you encounter a 

62
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:51,020
storm because you're stupid and wrong.
Is it really good idea?

63
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,680
Even though it's not an infinite 
applicability anyways,

64
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:57,830
they draw lots.
It's a primitive thing to do.

65
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,520
It's like,
wow,

66
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:00,070
it's one,
it's someone's fault.

67
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,070
We don't know who we're going to throw 
someone overboard.

68
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:06,250
The worst sinner.
Obviously that's what God wants.

69
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:11,251
Some kind of sacrifice.
So they all draw lots and someone loses 

70
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:11,350
and then Jonah stands up and says,
well,

71
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,050
sorry guys,
like I know that I've got a problem with

72
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:19,051
God at the moment so it's probably me.
You better throw me over and they don't 

73
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:20,440
really want to.
But he finally convinces them over.

74
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:22,990
He goes,
and that storm settles.

75
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,070
Well,
you know,

76
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,820
sometimes if you're in a group of people
in an organization,

77
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:35,821
there is someone in the organization 
who's head is screwed on exactly 

78
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:39,621
straight and they know exactly why it is
and what they've done wrong and what 

79
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:43,471
puts them in that position and they are 
poisoning the entire enterprise and if 

80
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:46,810
you throw them overboard or better,
if they agreed voluntarily to leave,

81
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,660
then this storm will abate and 
everything will be okay.

82
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,230
So anyways,
they throw joe job over or Jonah 

83
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,811
overboard and a whale comes up and 
swallows them and take them down to the 

84
00:03:57,811 --> 00:03:57,811
bottom of the ocean.
Well,

85
00:03:57,811 --> 00:03:59,290
we already know what that means because 
we watched Pinocchio.

86
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:04,291
It's like when God abandons you because 
you've abandoned your destiny and the 

87
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:10,111
storms come up,
the probability that you're going to be 

88
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:11,890
taken down to the,
to the depths is extraordinarily high,

89
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:13,840
and that happens in people's lives all 
the time.

90
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,270
Also down there,
Jonah repents.

91
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Well,
what do you do when you were in the 

92
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:21,720
underworld?
When you've been there before,

93
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,680
when things fall apart on your friends 
have abandoned you.

94
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,690
You're not as popular as you could be.
You can't stand to look at yourself in 

95
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:27,820
the mirror into the underworld.
You go and you think,

96
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,040
Geez,
I've done a lot of things wrong.

97
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,530
You know,
maybe I should reconcile myself with the

98
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:34,330
world that I could get out of this wall.

99
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,740
So that's what Jonah does.
He thinks,

100
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:37,660
all right,
I've got this destiny.

101
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,110
I better go do what God says.
So the whale spit some out onto the 

102
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,070
beach and off he goes to the city to 
tell them what's wrong.

103
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,460
Well,
that's what that represents.

104
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:49,960
That's these symbols.
You know,

105
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,850
it's so cool.
This second one,

106
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:53,080
I really,
I really like.

107
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:58,081
It's so interesting because you see 
Jonah and reemerging from the whale and 

108
00:04:58,081 --> 00:04:58,660
he's got a halo around his head and you 
say,

109
00:04:58,661 --> 00:04:59,620
well,
what's a halo?

110
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,010
Have you ever looked at a quarter?
Well,

111
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:08,011
think about a quarter.
A quarter is the moon and who's on the 

112
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,340
quarter?
The Queen,

113
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,220
the queen is surrounded by the halo of 
the Moon,

114
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,730
the Queens Queen of the Queen of the 
night gold coin.

115
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:19,480
That's the king's head on the sun.
That's the halo.

116
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,420
Well,
what comes out of the belly of the fish?

117
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,850
It's the illuminated human being.

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,310
It's the spirit of the illuminated human
being.

119
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,890
That's what that means.
Well,

120
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,880
what does that mean?
Well,

121
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,710
what else would come out of chaos?
You know,

122
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:37,711
if you,
if you fall apart and then you put 

123
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:37,711
yourself back together,
what is it that comes back out?

124
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,930
At least you're in better shape than you
were before,

125
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,960
you know,
and then maybe you do that 20 times in 

126
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,330
your life or 50 times and you do it 
voluntarily.

127
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,810
Every time you do it,
you're more like the thing with the halo

128
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,220
and less like the thing that's being 
thrown overboard by your friends.
