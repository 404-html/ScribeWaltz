1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,820
Can you hazard a guess what Europe is 
clamping down on speech critical of 

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,420
Islam when Islam is causing lots of 
problems with rape,

3
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:08,380
gangs,
terrorism,

4
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:10,510
and generally being a menace?
Why?

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,940
Well,
I suppose the first,

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,510
let's say if I was going to oppose that 
statement,

7
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:22,410
I would say,
well,

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,060
perhaps it's a propaganda stick.
Uh,

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,560
uh,
what would you call it,

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,620
conspiracy to blame what's happening in 
Europe on Islamic immigrants?

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,160
I guess part of the problem is,
is that at least as far as I can tell,

12
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:43,161
the news has become sufficiently 
unreliable because it's so polarized 

13
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:43,800
that we can't really tell what's going 
on.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,280
I mean,
I think the reason that Europe is 

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,100
clamping down on speech critical of 
Islam is partly the same reason that the

16
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:58,101
entire Western world is clamping down on
speech that's critical of anything that 

17
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:02,540
is associated with group identity,
which is pretty much any set of ideas 

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,321
that unites people and it's,
it's a consequence of the collective 

19
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:11,841
decision that we've made.
That egalitarianism and a conflict 

20
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:17,451
avoidance constitute the two highest 
virtues and they trump everything else 

21
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:17,520
including free speech.

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,710
Now why that's happened is very,
very difficult thing to say.

23
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:27,711
I mean I'm,
I suspect to some degree that it's a 

24
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:29,430
consequence of women becoming involved 
in the political system,

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,820
which is something that we've never 
experienced before and women are more 

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,310
agreeable by nature than men and I'm 
variable.

27
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,520
People are are compassionate towards 
those.

28
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,270
They see a suffering and that seems to 
include any minority,

29
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:49,140
especially when you combine that with a 
kind of neo Marxist doctrine that claims

30
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:51,900
that anyone who has an advantage swiped 
it.

31
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:56,901
And I think in the Islamic situation,
you get it real conflict there because 

32
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,300
it's obviously the case that many 
Islamic practices are not commensurate 

33
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,160
with postmodern neo Marxist feminism,
let's say.

34
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:09,090
But they seem to get a free pass.
And I guess that's because the idea that

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,120
all cultures are equal trumps the 
requirement for human rights for women.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And.
And maybe the other thing that's even 

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,691
darker is that there's a fair bit of 
revolutionary fervor in the more radical

38
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:29,421
end of the political spectrum.
And that radical fervor is devoted 

39
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:33,981
towards tearing down the patriarchy.
And of course that's basically Western 

40
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:35,400
civilization.
And so if,

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,640
because Islam isn't part of Western 
civilization,

42
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,810
than it can be seen as an ally in that,
in that attempt,

43
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,320
that's what it looks like to me.
I also think that ignorance and and all 

44
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:53,721
of that contribute.
It isn't obvious that people who are 

45
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:59,451
afraid of such things as Islamophobia 
really understand anything about Islam 

46
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:01,180
wouldn't say I understand anything about
Islam.

47
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,830
Even though I've read a fair bit about 
it,

48
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:07,180
it's very difficult to put yourself 
inside a different belief system.

49
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,660
I'm somewhat apprehensive about Islam 
because it looks to me like it's a 

50
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:18,841
totalizing system as well as a religion 
and it's a totalizing system because 

51
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,040
everything has to come under his 
purview,

52
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:25,600
including law and and everything that 
goes along with that.

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,850
There's no separation between church and
state.

54
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,390
And so I don't see how that's 
commensurate with the western mode of 

55
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,601
existence.
And I don't think people want to have 

56
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:36,601
that conversation because they want to 
say,

57
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:39,910
well no,
everyone diverse as they are.

58
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:44,911
And important as that diversity is 
apparently such that everyone has to be 

59
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:49,201
represented equally.
The diversity isn't really of anything 

60
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:53,280
about anything fundamental and we can 
all get along without a problem and I'm 

61
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:58,000
afraid that that's extraordinarily 
naive.

62
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,900
And then I suppose there's also an 
element of something like Western guilt,

63
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,430
I guess perhaps for what has been 
described as our imperialist past,

64
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,520
um,
the,

65
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,150
there's been a very longterm assault

66
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,560
on,
on the,

67
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,570
what would you call it,
moral

68
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,590
on the morality of the West.
We're often viewed as the rapers and 

69
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,091
pillagers of the world and that sort of 
goes along with the environmentalist 

70
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:32,361
ethos.
And so I think we do have a fair bit of 

71
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:33,810
guilt about that,
whether it's warranted or not.

72
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,110
Um,
I mean history is a bloody nightmare and

73
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:40,470
it doesn't matter where you look.
And I would say at least in the West has

74
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:43,620
brought advantages along with its 
disadvantages.

75
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,520
And I think that our attitude towards 
individuality is fundamentally correct 

76
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,130
and absolutely vital.
And I would also say that the only 

77
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,470
countries in the world that are 
essentially worth living in,

78
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,680
in any real sense are the ones that are 
predicated on the Judeo Christian 

79
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,200
tradition and manifested in western the 
western body of laws.

80
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,740
So,
but there's still plenty of guilt and 

81
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,790
there's plenty of people who,
well,

82
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,220
who are,
what contemptuous of being,

83
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,510
as we discussed it,
the last question and also angry with 

84
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,751
the political system because they're 
powerless or maybe they've been hurt by 

85
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:23,790
male authority figures.

86
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,070
Um,
and that happens very frequently.

87
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:31,071
And so they have absolutely no trust in 
higher in hierarchical structures.

88
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:36,711
And there you might add to that to a 
certain amount of laziness because the 

89
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:40,350
thing about hierarchical structures is 
that they impose values on people.

90
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:45,351
And then in order to progress in that 
value structure that you have to 

91
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:48,081
discipline yourself and work hard.
And many of the radical leftists 

92
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,590
happened to be very low in 
conscientiousness.

93
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,740
And so they don't believe in hard work 
and they don't believe that people get 

94
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,960
to where they're going by hard work.
And,

95
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,730
well,
one other thing,

96
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:03,731
there's a group of people I think who 
were basically personality disordered 

97
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:07,251
in,
those are the ones that had never had a 

98
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:07,430
positive relationship with anything that
was masculine.

99
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:11,840
And so whenever they see anything 
masculine that has motive power and that

100
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:15,230
would include authority and competence,
not just power,

101
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,100
they assume that that's tyrannical and 
it's part of the postmodern assumption 

102
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,750
that all power higher,
all hierarchies are hierarchies of power

103
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,170
when the truth of the matter is,
is that hierarchies in the West are 

104
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,130
usually hierarchies of authority and 
competence and they're like,

105
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:36,131
they're oriented towards getting a 
certain task done and they actually do 

106
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:36,131
get the task done.

107
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:38,240
So,
but we're,

108
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,870
I'm dubious about our own ethical.
Um,

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,880
what would you say?
Integrity.

110
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,210
And I guess that's also why it's a 
particular importance for people to try 

111
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,991
to act honestly,
because if you don't act honestly and 

112
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:59,740
then you start to doubt your own 
integrity and then when people come 

113
00:06:59,740 --> 00:06:59,740
after you,
you're going to be weak.

114
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,300
And that's a really bad idea.
So.
