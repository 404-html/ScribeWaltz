1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,650
And the psychoanalyst,
I think,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,870
err too much on the side of the subject.
They tend to think that too much of you 

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,870
is inside of you and too little of us 
outside of you.

4
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:15,871
And part of the reason I believe that is
because of my clinical experience.

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,050
I love the psychoanalyst Matt.
They're brilliant,

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:25,110
they're brilliant or deep.
They grapple with real problems like 

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,760
with the problems when people have real 
problems that I mean profound problems.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,900
They're really profound moral problems 
or problems of good and evil really.

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,290
You know,
there are things going on in their 

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,150
family that are so terrible that well 
that there are,

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,980
there are sometimes fatal,
you know,

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,800
lie upon,
lie upon,

13
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:47,820
lie upon lie for decades and decades and
decades.

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,990
It's awful.
And that's not exactly inside them.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,250
It's out there in the world.
And lots of the people that I see,

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,490
very famous critic of psychology,

17
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,810
I can't remember his name,
but I probably will criticize the 

18
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:18,410
practice of psychology quite effectively
in the believe in the early sixties.

19
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,770
The Myth of mental illness by Thomas 
Sad,

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,670
zed,
a s zed.

21
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:29,110
It's classic.
You should read it if you're interested 

22
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:29,110
in psychology.
Read it like it's.

23
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,800
It's a classic and he basically said,
most people have problems in living.

24
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:38,150
They don't have psychological problems,
and so I've experienced,

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,300
despite my love for the psychoanalysts,
very frequently what I'm doing as a 

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,360
therapist is helping people have a life 
that would work.

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,440
You know,
and you can parameterize that.

28
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,820
It's like,
what do you need?

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,930
How about some friends that people kind 
of like that?

30
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,960
How about an intimate relationship with 
someone that you can trust that maybe 

31
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:01,970
has a future?
That'd be good.

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,360
How about a career that puts you in a 
dominance hierarchy somewhere so at 

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,860
least you've got some possibility of 
rising,

34
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:13,870
some possibility of stabilizing yourself
and a schedule and a routine because no 

35
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:16,010
one can live without a routine.

36
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,920
You just forget that if you guys don't 
have a routine,

37
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,640
I would recommend you get one going 
because you cannot be mentally healthy 

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,441
without a routine.
You need to pick a time to get up 

39
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,800
whatever time you want,
but pick one and stick to it because 

40
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,981
otherwise you disregulate your circadian
rhythms and they regulate your mood and 

41
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:38,870
eat something.
In the morning.

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,320
I had lots of clients who've that 
anxiety disorders,

43
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,780
hired one client who was literally 
starving,

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,590
very smart girl.
She was very little that she liked.

45
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:51,500
She kind of tried to subsist on like 
half a cup of rice a day.

46
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,170
She came to me and said,
I have no energy.

47
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:56,780
I come home.
All I want to do is watch the same movie

48
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:57,640
over and over.
What?

49
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,270
Like,
is that weird?

50
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,730
And I thought,
well,

51
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:02,170
it depends on how hard you work.
You know,

52
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:04,510
it's a little weird,
but whatever.

53
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,240
It's familiar,
you're looking for comfort.

54
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,450
So I did an analysis of her diet.
It's like three quarters of a cup of 

55
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,440
rice.
It's like you're starving,

56
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,900
eat something,
you know,

57
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,140
you'll feel better.
So she modified her diet and you're all 

58
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,791
around.
Anxiety went away and she had some 

59
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:28,791
energy.
It's like,

60
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,280
yeah,
you got to eat.

61
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,140
So schedule.
That's a good thing,

62
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:35,190
man.
Your brain will.

63
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:40,191
Thank you for it.
It will stabilize your nervous system 

64
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:40,380
where there's a bit of a plan.
That's a good thing.

65
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,680
You need a career.
You need something productive to do with

66
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:48,681
your time.
You need to regulate your use of drugs 

67
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:52,401
and alcohol.
Most particularly alcohol because that 

68
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:52,401
does even a lot of people.

69
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,130
You need a family,
like the family,

70
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:00,580
you have your parents and all that.
It'd be nice if you all got along.

71
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:05,581
You could work on that.
That's a good thing to work on and then 

72
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:08,101
you know,
you probably need children at some 

73
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:08,101
point.
That's life.

74
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:10,570
That's what life is and if you're 
missing,

75
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,830
you know,
you may have a good reason to not be 

76
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,770
operating on one of those dimensions.
It's not mandatory,

77
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,690
but I can tell you that if you're not 
operating reasonably well on four,

78
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:27,691
I think I mentioned six,
if you're not operating reasonably well 

79
00:04:27,691 --> 00:04:30,391
on at least three of them,
there's no way you're going to be 

80
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,520
psychologically thriving and that's more
pragmatic in some sense than 

81
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:37,050
psychological,
right?

82
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,150
Human beings have a nature.
There's things we need and if we have 

83
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,580
them well that's good and if we don't 
have them well then we feel the lack.

84
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,150
So behaviorists,
behavioral psychologists concentrate a 

85
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,240
lot more on that sort of thing.
You know,

86
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:54,970
it's practical.
It's like strategizing.

87
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Make a career plan,
figure out how to negotiate because 

88
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:00,720
that's bloody important.
Figuring out how to say what you need,

89
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,710
figure out how to tell the truth to 
people,

90
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,920
figure out how to listen to your partner
in particular because if you listen to 

91
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:15,421
them,
they will actually tell you what they 

92
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:16,540
want and sometimes you can give it to 
them and maybe they'll return the favor.

93
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,120
And if you practice that for like 15 
years,

94
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,660
well then maybe you're constantly giving
each other what you want.

95
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,000
Well Hooray.
That would be good.

96
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:30,390
And then there's two of you under both 
circumstances and it's better to have 

97
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,080
two brains than one because people think
differently because of their temperament

98
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,110
mostly.
And so the negotiation is where the 

99
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,850
wisdom arises and it's part of the 
transformation,

100
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,870
the psychological transformation that's 
attendant on an intimate relationship,

101
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,830
and one of the fundamental purposes of a
longterm intimate relationship.
