1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I mean,
there's a lot of debate in the 

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,681
scientific literature about the meaning 
of dreams and perhaps there's even 

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:09,960
debate about whether it's possible for 
dreams to have meaning.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,430
I think partly the debate exists because
to do dream analysis properly,

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,480
as union particular pointed out,
uh,

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,740
you need a vast body of knowledge in the
dream interpreter about comparative 

7
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:31,581
mythology and ritual and symbol and,
and art history and so forth because 

8
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:38,301
dreams of course use images as their 
primary means of conceptualization now 

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,190
in order to understand what,
what dreams mean and how they can be 

10
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,611
useful in therapy apart from 
appreciating the fact that the 

11
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:54,831
interpreter needs a broad body of 
knowledge that scientists generally 

12
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:59,391
don't develop.
It's also important to know what it is 

13
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:00,870
that scientists have discovered about 
dreams.

14
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,930
So for example,
we know that dreams occur during rapid 

15
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,510
eye movement sleep.
You cycle into rapid eye movement.

16
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,270
Sleep about every 90 minutes when you're
asleep,

17
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,140
when you're in rapid eye movement,
sleep,

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,860
your motor centers.
So your action centers are very much 

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,061
activated in your brain,
but your body is paralyzed so that you 

20
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:26,540
can't move around.
Um,

21
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,780
your eyes are moving because of course 
it doesn't really matter if your eyes 

22
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,110
move while you're asleep because they 
won't take you anywhere,

23
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:36,240
but if your legs were moving while you 
were asleep,

24
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:41,241
you run into walls while you were 
dreaming and scientists have actually 

25
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,790
managed to damage the motor inhibition 
systems in cats so that they do move 

26
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:53,991
around when they're dreaming anyways.
If you wake up when someone's dreaming,

27
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:58,260
their brain is about as active as it is 
when they're awake,

28
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,100
so there's a tremendous amount of neural
processing going on in the dream state.

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,830
If you wake someone up when they're 
dreaming,

30
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,810
there's about an 80 percent chance that 
they'll report the emotion of anxiety.

31
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,980
Dreams tend to focus on threat 
processing.

32
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,850
Now,
a threat is anything that might hurt 

33
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,811
you,
but it's more than that to a threat is 

34
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:24,600
anything that doesn't fit into your 
current conceptual scheme.

35
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,730
So imagine that you have a theory about 
the way the world is and then you act on

36
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:33,660
that theory and sometimes things work 
out the way you'd like them to work out,

37
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,020
but often they don't.
And every time things work out in a way 

38
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,281
that isn't how you would like or how you
predicted that indicates that there's 

39
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:48,441
some more about the world that you have 
to learn about and that fact first 

40
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:54,051
manifests itself in anxiety.
Now the dream focuses on anxiety and 

41
00:02:55,651 --> 00:03:00,651
then it loosens up.
It's the normal conceptual constraints 

42
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:05,311
that characterize waking thinking and it
starts to play in a sense or hypothesize

43
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,290
about how your current categorical 
structure could be shifted around so 

44
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,130
that that threat could be accounted for.

45
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,090
Okay?
Now that means the dream is dealing with

46
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:23,080
things that you need to understand,
but you don't yet understand.

47
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,080
So when you wake up and you remember the
dream,

48
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,290
the dream doesn't really make sense 
because it's about something you don't 

49
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,351
understand.
Now it's your brain's best guess at 

50
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:36,940
configuring or understanding the 
unknowable,

51
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,280
but it's like it's like the first layer 
of a multilayered process,

52
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,370
which eventually would culminate in 
fully developed thought maybe over 

53
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:53,010
months or maybe over years,
or maybe you would never manage it at 

54
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,531
all.
The unknown thing or the threat is just 

55
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:56,320
too great to really come to any terms 
with it whatsoever.

56
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,980
Okay?
Now imagine that you're dreaming about 

57
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,841
something and it produces enough emotion
with the threat produces enough emotion,

58
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:07,480
not only to produce a very vivid dream,
but to wake you up.

59
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,880
When you wake up,
you remember the dream and then you go 

60
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,540
to someone about it.
Well,

61
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,600
the dream is about something you don't 
yet understand that it's upsetting and 

62
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,011
if you tell a bunch of people about it,
they're going to give you all sorts of 

63
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:25,621
opinions on the dream and that's a way 
that you can gather more information 

64
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:25,621
about the threat,

65
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,950
which is known as a nightmare.
Perhaps Cynthia dream,

66
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:36,951
which is troubling,
all puzzling because it's so abstract.

67
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,710
Could you differentiate?
I think

68
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,100
it's clearer in the case of nightmares 
and often too,

69
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:45,780
because nightmares tend to have 
archetipal themes.

70
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,750
You know,
people for example,

71
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:52,751
are often threatened by monsters at 
night and a monster is a Chi Mira that's

72
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:57,680
made up of the different parts of 
different parts of frightening thing.

73
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,020
A dragon is a camera,
for example,

74
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:05,021
because it's made out of reptilian parts
and it also includes the idea of fire in

75
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:11,441
transformation,
so a nightmare is that a dream that 

76
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:16,631
tends to use archetipal imagery to 
conceptualize a fairly powerful threat 

77
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,270
and if you recounted nightmare to a 
person with no specific training,

78
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:27,551
they're going to have some opinion about
it and their opinion might be useful in 

79
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:28,520
terms of information,
Katherine,

80
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:34,030
but if you recount a dream to someone 
who's psychologically trained and his 

81
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,260
also symbolically trained and who has,
you know,

82
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,030
great,
great depth of knowledge with regards to

83
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,900
the structure of religious thinking and 
and comparative literature.

84
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,260
The light that they're going to shed on 
your dream is much greater and more 

85
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,761
profound and sometimes a,
a dream interpretation can offer the 

86
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:57,440
person who's had the dream a leap 
forward in knowledge that might've taken

87
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,500
them five or six years to conceptualize 
by themselves.

88
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,040
No ordinarily have had.
Because the person who's the expert 

89
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,110
who's had the dream recounted to them 
knows and says,

90
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,170
Oh yes,
I know of that place that they say the 

91
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,460
theme to that experience.
They've had that symbol and it's meaning

92
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,870
and a bubble what it feels like because 
of surely it is,

93
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:25,750
um,
some people say that me included,

94
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,020
I'm that one way to interpret a dream 
when you wake up is to just like you 

95
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,460
would taste a sip of wine,
just hold the flavor and,

96
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:42,731
and hold the feeling.
What does it feel like and what does 

97
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:43,240
feel,
what feels the same in your real life?

98
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,360
And that's what the dream is trying to 
tell you with a collage of singles and 

99
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,730
memories as well that is drawn on in 
recent.

100
00:06:51,731 --> 00:06:53,730
I'm conscious,
uh,

101
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,730
experience to try and put it together.
Hence the dream can be very abstract.

102
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:59,530
Would you say that's the case?
Sometimes

103
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,510
I think there's two things are really 
worth highlighting in the first is the 

104
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:13,130
category is that a dream uses are 
generally based on emotional similarity 

105
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,820
rather than logical similarity?

106
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,460
Yes.

107
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,590
So a dream for example,
might represent fear or the fear of 

108
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:25,601
something unknown by using a 
juxtaposition of a variety of images of 

109
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:28,460
frightening thing.
So imagine that in the dream world,

110
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:33,461
the basic rule is all things that 
produced the same emotion are the same 

111
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:38,410
thing,
and so you're a description of a dream 

112
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:43,601
interpretation process that relies on 
identifying similarities in emotional 

113
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:48,911
state,
gets right to the core of how dream 

114
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:50,000
thought works.
Now secondarily,

115
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:54,530
I also believe that if you are able to 
help someone,

116
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,610
a construct at dream interpretation that
fits there also able to feel that it 

117
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:05,060
fits,
it clicks or it makes sense or it's like

118
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:10,061
the punchline of a joke in some way they
can tell that the interpretation have,

119
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,460
uh,
put some missing pieces of the puzzle 

120
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,341
into place.
And I think it's important to rely on 

121
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:21,821
that as an indicator of whether the 
interpretation is actually derived from 

122
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:26,450
the dream or sort of just at a 
theoretical imposition on its structure.

123
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Now we can go underneath that too.
And I mentioned already that basic 

124
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,790
categories are more action oriented than
object oriented.

125
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,240
So basic categories,
the basic categories of the human mind 

126
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,080
are categories to do things with.
Well,

127
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,380
by the same token,
there are also motivational and 

128
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,590
emotional categories.
So the primordial mind,

129
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,740
like the animal mind thinks sort of 
axiomatically that all things that 

130
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:59,081
produced the same are the same thing.
So there's things that make you happy or

131
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:03,570
there's things that make you sad or 
there's things that make you anxious and

132
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:08,571
the fact that all those things share the
capacity to evoke that emotion speaks of

133
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:12,360
some essential essential identity 
between them.

134
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,020
Now the identity is in relationship to 
the experiencer and not necessarily with

135
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:20,730
regards to similarity between the 
objects,

136
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:26,330
but it's still how we naturally think.
And it's certainly how mythologies 

137
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,980
thinks and it's how drama thinks and how
religion things.

138
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,810
We've lost sight of that in part because
we've become scientifically trained to 

139
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,381
some degree and we tend to believe that 
the real categories of the world are 

140
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:39,930
objective and,
uh,

141
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,950
that,
that just strikes me as it's wrong.

142
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,000
There's something about it that's wrong 
and it's wrong because we have to act.
