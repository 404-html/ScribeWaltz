1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,390
The people turning out in vast numbers,
every one of your talks in Australia 

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,380
been oversubscribed massively.
It tells you that they kind of get those

3
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:12,060
mortar,
this being told,

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,850
well,
it's one of the things that's so 

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:17,850
interesting about dealing with 
archetipal themes,

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,000
you know,
archetypal themes or archetipal because 

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,680
they actually speak of the structure of 
human experience.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,010
That's why they last,
and so it's human nature and human 

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,151
experience has a pattern.
You don't have the capacity to 

10
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:34,560
articulate that pattern as an individual
in part because your life is too short.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,310
You just can't figure it out.
But the,

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,830
the ancient representations of those 
patterns are everywhere around you.

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,010
And you know,
some of them at the image you caught 

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,010
onto them automatically,
you,

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,830
you,
you fall into them.

16
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:48,240
If you go to a movie,
for example,

17
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:50,310
because movies always express archetipal
themes.

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,340
If you hear them articulate it,
you think,

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,390
I,
I knew that.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,490
I knew that.
I just don't know how to say it.

21
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,560
That's,
that's the platonic idea of,

22
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,430
of,
um,

23
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,790
of,
of learning as remembering your soul 

24
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,220
already knows,
but it doesn't have the words.

25
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,200
And so when people talk to me about 
watching my lectures,

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,710
let's say they say they basically say 
one of two things,

27
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,280
if,
if it's.

28
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,220
If it's not just a simple thank you.
They say one of two things.

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,190
A third of them say,
quarter of them say,

30
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,510
when I listened to you talk,
it's as if you're telling me things that

31
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:26,070
I already know.
It's like,

32
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:27,150
yeah,
well that's exactly right,

33
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:29,460
because that's what archetypal stories 
are there.

34
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:31,200
The description of what you already 
know,

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,560
but that can be articulated.
And then who you are and how you see 

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,930
yourself and the way you described 
yourself all become the same thing.

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,600
So that's wonderful.
Then you're not at odds with yourself,

38
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,710
you know,
and then you have.

39
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,830
Then you're a functioning unity and that
makes you much stronger and more 

40
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,651
indomitable than you would otherwise be.
And then the other thing that people 

41
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:54,861
say,
and this is more like three quarters of 

42
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:54,861
them,
is that they say,

43
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:56,160
I was in a very dark place.
I was addicted.

44
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:57,900
I was,
I was drinking too much.

45
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:02,901
I had a fragment,
did relationship with my fiance and I 

46
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:06,021
wasn't getting married.
Things weren't going very well with my 

47
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:08,931
family.
My relationship with my father was 

48
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:08,931
damaged.
I didn't have any ame.

49
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:10,530
I was wasting my time.
Some variant of that,

50
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,560
some combination of those and they say,
well,

51
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,660
I've been watching your lectures.
I've decided to establish a purpose.

52
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,250
I'm trying to tell the truth and things 
are way better and I've.

53
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,370
And so let's say I've done maybe eight 
or nine large scale public talks in the 

54
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,240
last two months,
so that's probably 20,000

55
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:35,241
people and about half of them,
a third to half of them estate 

56
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:35,790
afterwards to talk to me,
so that's about 7,000

57
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:40,791
people who have said that to me and then
people stop me on the street all the 

58
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,450
time and tell me exactly that story,
which is just wonderful.

59
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,170
You can't imagine how good it is to be 
able to go to places you've never been 

60
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,220
and to have people stop people in the 
streets spontaneously and say,

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,010
look,
my life is way better than it was.

62
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:56,850
It's like it's so good and so,
and I've got like,

63
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,560
I don't know,
35,000

64
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:01,120
letters from people since last August.
It's more than that.

65
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,520
I can't keep track of them,
and it's exactly the same thing,

66
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,560
like three court,
a quarter of them say,

67
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,830
well,
you've given me the words to say what I 

68
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:10,830
already knew was true,
and thank you for that.

69
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,850
I can see that in the audience.
It's so interesting because I can lay 

70
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,941
out a story.
People go like this and say they're 

71
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:20,341
doing that all the time.
It's like the lights are going on and 

72
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:22,921
that's a really wild.
There's almost nothing better than that 

73
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:22,921
to watch lights go on when you're 
talking to people.

74
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:25,690
It's like,
that's just absolutely fantastic.

75
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,260
But to get this response from people.
My father,

76
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,970
I have,
my father's about 80,

77
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,600
80 is 83,
I think 81.

78
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,910
He's 81.
And uh,

79
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,360
I put him in charge of going through my 
viewer email,

80
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,340
which is an overwhelming job.
But now we've had discussions about this

81
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:50,341
constantly.
He's overwhelmed by the fact that so 

82
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:50,341
many people are writing and saying the 
same thing.

83
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:50,950
It's like,
well,

84
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,010
I have a purpose,
man.

85
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:58,050
My life actually matters.
I finally realized that and I'm putting 

86
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,781
it into practice and I'm bearing up 
under the heaviest load I can imagine 

87
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:04,621
and it's really helping.
It's like God and that's tens of 

88
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,310
thousands of responses now,
so it's.

89
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,410
It's you couldn't hope for anything 
better than that.

90
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,240
There's zero harm in it,
right?

91
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,890
It's just people putting their lives 
together,

92
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,040
they're not mucking about with other 
people and are trying to make broad 

93
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,040
scale.

94
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,430
Social transformation is about which 
they have no idea.

95
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,050
They're trying to make their immediate 
environment better and it's working.

96
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,270
It's like great.
Great.

97
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,870
You say the zero harm in,
I'd say as a former legislator,

98
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,871
that there's an enormous amount of good 
in a country is only the sum total of 

99
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:40,351
the people that make it up to the extent
that they put together resilient 

100
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:43,510
contribute,
don't have to ask others to help them.

101
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,190
The stronger the nation,
the society and rapidly like.

102
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:50,470
I mean,
I think I was thinking the other day,

103
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,530
some a journalist asked me why the 
audience by people are responding so 

104
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,500
positively to what I'm saying.
The young men for example,

105
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,520
and I thought,
hmm,

106
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,110
why?
Why?

107
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,260
Yeah.
That's a good question.

108
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,000
Says,
well,

109
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:05,010
I'm actually on their side.
I'm pretty happy that I'm really happy 

110
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,661
that they're not wasting their lives.
I'm really sad to see that people are 

111
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:12,580
disenchanted and nihilistic and 
depressed and anxious and aimless and,

112
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,910
and perverse and vengeful and,
and all of those things.

113
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:20,911
It's terrible.
And then to see people question whether 

114
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:22,910
that's necessary and then to start to 
rise out of that.

115
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:24,290
It's like,
it's so fun.

116
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:28,130
Like last night I was at after my talk,
so overwhelming.

117
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,060
I don't usually think about these 
things,

118
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:40,061
but I was,
I was after my talk last night and so 

119
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:40,600
all these people line up and you know,
they have their 15,

120
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,740
15 seconds with me and they're kind of 
tentative.

121
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:47,741
They're excited and attentive when they 
come up to talk to me and then they 

122
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:47,741
have,
you know,

123
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:49,640
15 seconds of time to tell me something.
I'm really listening to them and they're

124
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,540
hesitant about whether or not to share 
the good news about their life.

125
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,570
You know?
And I think it's often because when 

126
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,800
share good news about their life,
people don't necessarily respond 

127
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,160
positively.
You know,

128
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:08,420
they don't give encouragement and people
need so little encouragement.

129
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:11,720
It's just unbelievable.
And so they're telling me something good

130
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:12,400
and I think,
God,

131
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:13,270
it's so good.
You know,

132
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,120
somebody says,
oh,

133
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,360
I'm getting along better with my father.
I haven't seen him for 10 years and now 

134
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,840
we get along great.
And that,

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,880
the power of that,
you can't overstate the power of that 

136
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,720
for individuals to get their life 
together.

137
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:31,721
They individuals and unbelievably 
powerful force and every single person 

138
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:36,310
who gets their act together a little bit
has the capacity to spread that around 

139
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:36,310
them.
It's,

140
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,800
it's a chain reaction and so it's a 
lovely thing to see and that's 

141
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,050
fantastic.
