1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,130
The first thing I would say is that if 
you're dealing with someone who's 

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,500
depressed and they're really depressed,
you should try giving him 

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,170
antidepressants because if they die,
you can't help them.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,050
Okay,
so if you're suffering,

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,680
you are obligated in a sense to hold 
onto whatever roped someone throws you,

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,990
and one of the things I do with my 
clients all the time,

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,850
especially if they're really in trouble,
is to tell them,

8
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:31,851
look,
I don't know exactly what's going to 

9
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:34,100
help you,
but don't arbitrarily throw out any 

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,711
possibilities because you might not have
that luxury and antidepressants help a 

11
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:38,550
lot of people and there are technical 
reasons why that's the case.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,910
So that's a simple answer.
It's not relevant to what I already 

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,100
described except that if you're offered 
a gift by your society and it works,

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,160
try it.
I don't care what your presuppositions 

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,160
are.

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,660
Apart from that,

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,720
lots of lots of time,
lots of the time you see people who are 

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,600
suffering with depression,
for example.

19
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:03,820
There's a multitude of reasons,
but I'll take one common reason,

20
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,090
um,
you could think about it as associated 

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,461
with the story of Peter Pan.
Peter Pan is someone who won't grow up 

22
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:12,490
right now.
The problem with Peter Pan is he gets to

23
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:14,650
be king,
but it's King of Neverland.

24
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,830
Neverland doesn't exist,
so being king of nothing isn't that 

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,380
helpful?
Well,

26
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:25,381
one of the things that you often see 
with people who suffer from depression 

27
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:28,460
and and and not making a blanket 
statement about the cause of depression 

28
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,711
because there's lots of them,
is that people who don't have enough 

29
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:32,020
order in their life tend to get 
overwhelmed.

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,500
So for example,
if someone comes into me and see to see 

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,591
me and they say they're depressed,
I always asked him a very standard set 

32
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:41,620
of questions.
Do you have a job?

33
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,470
If you don't have a job,
you're really in trouble in our society.

34
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,370
First of all,
you,

35
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,460
your biological rhythms stand to go off 
the rails right away because there's no 

36
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:51,890
reason to go to bed at any particular 
time and there's no reason to get up.

37
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:55,310
And for many people,
if they don't get up at the same time,

38
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,610
they follow up the functioning of their 
circadian rhythms and that's enough to 

39
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,851
make them depressed right off the bat.
Especially if they start napping during 

40
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:04,460
the afternoon,
they also don't have a purpose.

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,950
People aren't good without a purpose,
and this isn't.

42
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,190
This isn't hypothesizing.
We absolutely understand the circuitry 

43
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,810
that underlies positive emotion.
We know how it works.

44
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Almost all the positive emotion that any
of you are likely to experience in your 

45
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,780
life will not be a consequence of 
attaining things.

46
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:26,170
It will be a consequence of seeing that 
things are working as you proceed 

47
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,400
towards a goal you value,
that's completely different and you need

48
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:30,440
to know this because people are often 
stunned.

49
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,170
For example,
they finished their phd thesis and their

50
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:38,171
presupposition is that they're going to 
be elated for a month and often instead 

51
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:38,710
they're actually depressed and they 
think,

52
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,830
what?
Hell I'd been working on this for seven 

53
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,060
years and I handed it in and what do I 
do now?

54
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:45,620
And that's what depresses them,
right?

55
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:46,790
It's the,
what do I do now?

56
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,750
Well,
they're are fine.

57
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,790
If they enjoyed it,
pursuing the thing,

58
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,850
as long as it was working out,
they get a lot of enthusiasm and 

59
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:54,850
excitement over that because that's how 
our nervous systems work.

60
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,710
Most of your positive emotion is goal 
pursuit.

61
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:02,711
Emotion.
If take drugs like cocaine or 

62
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:05,191
amphetamine,
the reason they're enjoyable is because 

63
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:05,191
they turn on the systems that help you 
pursue goals.

64
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:07,540
That's why people like them.
So if you don't have a job,

65
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,730
you got no structure,
that's not good.

66
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,710
Plus you tend not to have a point.

67
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,340
So you're overwhelmed by chaotic lack of
structure and you don't have any 

68
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:17,340
positive emotion.
Well,

69
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,661
do you have any friends?
So sometimes you see people who are 

70
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:21,661
depressed,
they have no job,

71
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,140
they have no friends,
they have no intimate relationship,

72
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,350
they have an additional health problem 
and they have a drug and alcohol 

73
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:28,480
problem.
My experience has been,

74
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:32,950
if you have three of those problems,
it's almost impossible to help you.

75
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:38,490
You're so deeply mired in chaos that you
can't get out because you make progress 

76
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,180
on one front and one of your other 
problems pulls you down.

77
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,200
So one of the things I tell people who 
are depressed is like,

78
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,470
don't sacrifice your stability.
Get a job.

79
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,510
Even if it's not the job you exactly 
want,

80
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,010
get a damn job.
You need a job.

81
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,550
Find some friends,
get out in the dating circuit,

82
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,130
see if you can establish an intimate 
relationship,

83
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,890
put together some of the foundation 
litems that,

84
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,140
that are like pillars that you're life 
rests on.

85
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,880
Well,
that's the practical thing to do.

86
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,360
So that's one example with regards to 
depression.

87
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,500
Well,
the thing is you don't just launch it on

88
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:15,040
them,
you know,

89
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,100
you got to negotiate with the person and
you also got to teach them to negotiate 

90
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,310
with themselves.
And this is something that's very useful

91
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:22,360
to know,
you know,

92
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:27,361
um,
you can tyrannized yourself into doing 

93
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:27,361
things,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

94
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:31,330
What I would recommend instead is that 
you ask yourself what you're willing to 

95
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:31,510
do.
It's a really effective technique.

96
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:33,670
It's like a meditative techniques.
So for example,

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,350
you can get up in the morning,
you can take,

98
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,310
well,
you know,

99
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:39,010
I'd like to have a good day to day.
So I'd like to go to bed tonight without

100
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:42,460
feeling guilty because I didn't do some 
things I said I was going to do and I,

101
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,520
you know,
I'd like to have kind of an interesting 

102
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,021
day.
So you've got to fulfill my 

103
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:49,021
responsibilities.
And I want to,

104
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:49,021
you know,
enjoy the day.

105
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:49,330
Then you can ask yourself,
well,

106
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,600
okay,
what would I have to do in order for 

107
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,350
that to happen that I would do?
And the probability if you practice this

108
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:58,090
for three or four days is your brain 
will just tell you.

109
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:58,510
They'll say,
well,

110
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:03,511
you know,
there's that piece of homework that you 

111
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:03,511
haven't done for like three weeks.
You should knock that sucker off because

112
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,531
it will only take you 10 minutes and 
you've been avoiding it and torturing 

113
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:08,020
yourself to death for like 72 hours 
straight.

114
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:13,021
And if you do that,
here's a little interesting thing you 

115
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:13,021
can do.
And you know,

116
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:13,510
maybe this is a little obligations you 
should clean up.

117
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:18,511
And so what,
what you do in a situation like that as 

118
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:19,950
you teach the person to negotiate with 
themselves say,

119
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,460
well let's figure out what your aims 
are.

120
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:23,800
You going to have some ames,
whatever they are.

121
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,490
And they might say,
well,

122
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,500
I'm so depressed I don't have any aims.
And then I say,

123
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:29,110
well,
pick the least objectionable of the Ames

124
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,060
and act it out for awhile and see what 
happens.

125
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:36,061
Because sometimes your emotional,
your emotional systems are so followed 

126
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:39,511
up that you have to pretend you have to 
act the thing out before you can start 

127
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:40,030
to believe it.
I mean,

128
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:42,000
people always assume they have to 
believe in Vanap,

129
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,440
but,
but that's sometimes that's true in lots

130
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:45,130
of times.
It isn't.

131
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,640
So the trick,
if you're doing therapeutic work with 

132
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:50,640
somebody and you're helping them 
establish a structure,

133
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,090
is to find out what they'll do.
Now,

134
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,360
if they want to get better,
which is not a given because there are 

135
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,270
often payoffs for not getting better 
other.

136
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,300
That's basically the payoffs of being a 
martyr or maybe the payoffs of doing 

137
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,691
what you're entirely pathological family
members want you to do because they 

138
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:07,691
actually want you to fail.

139
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,510
Assuming you want to get better,
there's usually something you can figure

140
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:15,050
out that would constitute a step toward 
some sort of concrete goal.

141
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,470
And my presumption,
it's a behavior of presumptions 

142
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,350
fundamentally is that small accruing 
gains that repeat unbelievably powerful.

143
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,190
So you know,
this is another thing to know about in 

144
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,011
your own life.
It's something I learned in part from 

145
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:33,011
reading the writings of Aleksandr 
Solzhenitsyn.

146
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:34,190
He was a great Russian philosopher and 
novelist,

147
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,560
you know,
he said you can look at your life and 

148
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,280
you can see what isn't right about it.
We know you have to do is look,

149
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,940
and then you can start to fix that.
And the way you fix it is by noticing 

150
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,410
what you could in fact fix,
you know,

151
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:50,510
people are often trying to fix things 
they can fix,

152
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,570
which I would not recommend because if 
you try to fix something you can't text,

153
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:54,350
you'll just ruin it.

154
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,470
Like you can find all sorts of 
undergraduates who are perfectly willing

155
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:59,120
to restructure the,
uh,

156
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:04,121
you know,
the international economic system who 

157
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:05,420
cannot keep the room clean and there's 
actually a gap there,

158
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:05,990
you know,
which,

159
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:08,210
and it's surprising that people don't 
actually notice.

160
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,200
So I would say if you pay attention,
you can see things that you could fix.

161
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,000
They yell at you,
they really do.

162
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,850
We even know how that happens.
Let me,

163
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:21,110
let me give you an example because rooms
are full of stories and the stories have

164
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,050
have effects on you.
So here's a classic experiment.

165
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,630
So you take two groups of 
undergraduates,

166
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:30,590
you bring them into your lab and you 
give one group on a multiple choice test

167
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,830
that has a bunch of words in it that are
associated with being old and you give 

168
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,311
the other group the same multiple choice
test except the words are associated 

169
00:07:39,311 --> 00:07:39,311
with being young.

170
00:07:39,311 --> 00:07:40,640
This is independent of the content of 
the test.

171
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,450
It's just descriptions and then you 
time.

172
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,530
The undergraduate says they walked back 
to the elevators,

173
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,160
the ones who read,
the ones who completed the multiple 

174
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,160
choice tests that had more words 
associated with aging,

175
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,650
walk slower back to the elevators and 
they don't know that and they don't know

176
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:58,220
they're doing it and that that study has
been replicated in various forms.

177
00:07:58,221 --> 00:07:59,270
Many,
many times.

178
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:04,271
You're unbelievably sensitive to the 
story that your environment is telling 

179
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:04,820
you because your environment is not made
out of objects.

180
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,090
That's just wrong.
Your environment is basically made out 

181
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,790
of something like tools and obstacles.
You're a tool using creature.

182
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,550
You a tool perceiving creature,
the things you like.

183
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:14,860
If I take you out of this room and I 
said,

184
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:15,770
well,
what was in the room?

185
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,100
You're not going to say,
uh,

186
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,820
you know,
random patterns in the carpet because 

187
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:22,820
they're,
they're real or just as good an object.

188
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,430
Is there anything else?
You're going to say chairs because you 

189
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,500
can sit on them and you're going to say 
handrails because you can hold them.

190
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,570
You can say stairs because you can walk 
down them.

191
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,990
That's what you see and that's what you 
interact with and if you'll pay 

192
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:34,990
attention to your environment,
which is you,

193
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,280
by the way,
extended all of your experiences,

194
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:42,281
you,
it will tell you all the time what you 

195
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:42,281
should do.
All you have to do is do it,

196
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:42,740
but then you have to decide if you want 
to do it.

197
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,280
One of the things I've noticed about 
people because I've wondered once I 

198
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,830
started studying this mythological 
stories and I got this idea about the,

199
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:55,130
the fact that life can be meaningful 
enough to justify it suffering.

200
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,620
I thought,
God,

201
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:58,290
that's such a good idea because it's not
optimistic.

202
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,100
Exactly.
You know,

203
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:00,870
some people will tell you what,
you can be happy.

204
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,420
It's like those people are idiots.
I'm telling you,

205
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:08,421
they're idiots.
There's going to be things that come 

206
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:09,570
along that flat new so hard you won't 
believe it and you're not happy then,

207
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,090
and so if life is to be happy while in 
those situations,

208
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,890
what are you doing?
Why even live,

209
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,770
but that isn't?
Life isn't to be happy.

210
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:21,771
If you're happy,
you're bloody fortunate and you should 

211
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:23,811
enjoy it.
You should because it's the grace of 

212
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:23,811
God,
so to speak.

213
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:25,770
With regards to meaning,
I thought,

214
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:28,020
well,
people know when they're doing something

215
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:28,950
meaningful,
they can tell,

216
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,680
so why the hell don't they do meaningful
things all the time?

217
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:34,350
It seems obvious you could do it.
I mean it's hard,

218
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,810
you know,
because other people want you to do 

219
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,121
other things and it's a struggle,
but everything's a struggle and then I 

220
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:41,121
thought,
well,

221
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:41,670
oh,
I get it.

222
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,980
I see why it took me about 10 years to 
figure this out.

223
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,530
People have a choice.
Choice number one,

224
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,140
nothing you do means anything.
Well,

225
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,370
that's kind of a drag,
right?

226
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,400
Meaninglessness of life and all that 
existential angst,

227
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,990
you know,
that's kind of a pain,

228
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,080
but the upside of nothing that you do is
meaningful is you don't have to do 

229
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:02,400
anything.
You've got no responsibility.

230
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,430
No,
you have to suffer because things are 

231
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,961
meaningless,
but that's a small price to pay for 

232
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:09,930
being able to be completely useless.
The alternative,

233
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,900
the alternative is everything you do 
matters.

234
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,330
Really,
if you make a mistake,

235
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,120
it's a real mistake.
If you'd be traced someone,

236
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,020
you tilt the world a little more sharply
towards evil rather than good.

237
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,900
It matters what you do well.
If you buy that,

238
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:28,380
then you can have a meaningful life,
but there's no mucking around.

239
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,430
It means responsibility.
It means that the decisions you make are

240
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:37,431
important.
It means that when you do something 

241
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:37,431
wrong,
it's wrong.

242
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:38,940
Well,
do you want that.
