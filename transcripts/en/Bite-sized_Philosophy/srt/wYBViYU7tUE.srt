1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,080
You can imagine the flood

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:10,050
and then you can set yourself straight 
and then you can prepare for it and that

3
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:14,290
means maybe you can stave it off,
but it also means that maybe even if you

4
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:19,291
don't stave it off,
you could ride it out and that's 

5
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,870
actually the story of Noah because what 
happens with Noah is that he can see 

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,541
that things are not good and that 
there's a flood coming and God is maybe 

7
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:32,830
letting him know and it says in the 
story that Noah walked with God,

8
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:37,831
remembering that's what Adam did before 
he got all self conscious about the 

9
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:37,831
whole thing.
He walked with God.

10
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:42,210
We'll talk about that more next time,
but what that would mean maybe is 

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,241
because Noah was straight and he put 
himself together and his familial 

12
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:50,551
relationships were good because it also 
says that it his antenna were working 

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,160
and he could see a little farther into 
the future than someone whose vision was

14
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:57,430
completely obscured by,
by fog and chaos.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,350
And he could tell that things were not 
going to go well.

16
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,700
And so he prepared for it.
And because he prepared for it.

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,980
Well then things are actually went 
pretty well for Noah even though the 

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,040
flood came and so that's an interesting 
thing because that's an.

19
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,570
That's an indeterminant issue in human 
existence.

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,320
How big a hurricane would it take to 
wipe out New Orleans if everyone was 

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,320
heard?
Well,

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,920
the,
you're not going to wipe out the Dutch.

23
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:27,510
I mean that's going to be a tough one,
man.

24
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:32,511
You're going to have to conjure up a 
pretty damn big storm to take out their 

25
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:32,670
dykes.
Oh,

26
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,730
how thoroughly defendant New Orleans be 
if nobody in the municipal municipal and

27
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,430
state governments was corrupt.

28
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,780
Well,
end of the hurricane problem because 

29
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:47,780
that's something that we could clearly 
deal with.

30
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,531
We know how to do it and the same 
applies in your own life is that there 

31
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:53,250
are floods come and you can bloody well 
be sure of that.

32
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:57,540
That's absolutely 100 percent certain.
Some of them are going to be personal,

33
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:02,541
some of them are going to be familiar.
Some of them are going to be social and 

34
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:02,820
political and economic.
It's like,

35
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,260
are they going to be catastrophes for 
you or are you going to ride them out?

36
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,140
Are you going to prepare or the first 
issue might be,

37
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:15,141
well,
do you have your act together well 

38
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:15,141
enough to see them coming

39
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:18,890
with enough advance warning so that you 
can take proper measures maybe just to 

40
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,341
sidestep it,
maybe just don't go where the flood is 

41
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:22,341
going to be.
That's a simple thing,

42
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:23,880
but maybe you don't have that luxury.
Right,

43
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,800
and so it is going to be a catastrophe.
Maybe someone in your family is going to

44
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:30,240
get really,
really sick,

45
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,260
right,
and maybe maybe there's just a tiny 

46
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,590
pathway through that that everything 
doesn't fall apart.

47
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,470
It doesn't end in divorce.
It doesn't end in death.

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,900
It doesn't end in sorrow,
doesn't end in catastrophe,

49
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:47,901
but the margin of errors like slimmed 
down to virtually zero and every 

50
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:52,971
imperfection that you bring to that 
situation is going to increase the 

51
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:55,791
probability that that tragedy is going 
to turn it into something 

52
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:56,670
indistinguishable from hell.
And that's coming.

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,340
It's coming your way.
Absolutely,

54
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,780
and so then you might think,
well,

55
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:06,781
since it's coming your way,
maybe the best thing to do is to put 

56
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:09,781
yourself together so that when it comes,
it can be the least amount of awful 

57
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:12,160
possible,
so I'll close with this story.

58
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,850
This was a very affecting story for me.
My mother in law had frontal temporal 

59
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,840
dementia and she developed it quite 
young.

60
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,510
She was about 55,
something like that,

61
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,820
and her husband who is very extroverted,
man about town guy,

62
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,980
I grew up in a small town.
Everybody knew him.

63
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:37,900
He was charismatic,
drank too much charismatic,

64
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,590
good businessmen.
Quite a remarkable person,

65
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:45,520
a real character,
but not exactly a family man.

66
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:46,630
Even though he,
he,

67
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,220
he provided for his family very well,
but when his wife got sick,

68
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:56,550
he really took care of her man.
It was something to see because that's 

69
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,330
no joke.
Dealing with someone who has Alzheimer's

70
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:03,331
for all intents and purposes,
because they get taken away from you 

71
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:06,310
piece by piece and that is not pretty,
and then it's also hard,

72
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,500
right?
Not only is it catastrophic,

73
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:10,000
but it's hard,
and Jesus,

74
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:15,001
he just stepped into that like perfectly
and it was way less awful than it could 

75
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,880
have been way.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,600
It was just a tragedy.
It wasn't hell,

77
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:28,170
and then I was there when she died and 
my wife's family are actually pretty 

78
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,470
good at dealing with death.
As it turns out.

79
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,680
My wife's sister is a palliative care 
nurse and you have to be pretty tough 

80
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,250
cookie to be a palliative care nurse,
but you can do it,

81
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:42,850
which is pretty interesting because that
means that you can go make relationships

82
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:47,851
with people at the last stages of their 
life that are genuine relationships and 

83
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:50,500
people just die on you nonstop.
And yet,

84
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,560
you know she's a competent,
alive,

85
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:59,020
alert,
fun person.

86
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,170
It's like two thumbs up for her man that
someone you can rely on in a tragedy and

87
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:09,241
her other sister is a pharmacist and my 
wife has volunteered in palliative care 

88
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:15,691
wards and is also very good at taking 
care of people who are genuinely not in 

89
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:15,760
good health.

90
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,090
And so we were there when my mother in 
law died and course you can imagine.

91
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,680
Here's a,
here's a deathbed situation for you.

92
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,850
Your mother in law is dying and 
everyone's at each other's throats,

93
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,880
so like you think that's uncommon.
Then your eyes aren't open because it's 

94
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,240
plenty bloody comment and then it's not 
just a tragedy.

95
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:40,390
It's hell.
And like maybe you can stand the tragedy

96
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:45,391
but you can't stand the hell.
And in this situation that isn't what 

97
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:49,750
happened is everybody pulled together 
and what happened was while she died,

98
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,290
but what was so interesting was the 
family actually came together more 

99
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,131
tightly as a consequences.
So although there was something taken 

100
00:05:59,131 --> 00:05:59,131
away,
on the one hand,

101
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:03,910
there was something gained on the other 
that wasn't trivial and I'm not trying 

102
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,091
to be optimistic and you know,
isn't the universe a wonderful place 

103
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:07,130
about all this?

104
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,360
Like someone died in an ugly way and it 
was harsh,

105
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,810
but God,
it was a hell of a lot better than it 

106
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:16,810
could have been and maybe it was good 
enough.

107
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,070
That's the thing you know,
is that this is something that I 

108
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,561
constantly wonder is that if people did 
what they could to speak the truth and 

109
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:30,641
pay attention,
then maybe the tragedy that's part of 

110
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:35,201
life wouldn't have to deteriorate into 
the unbearable hell that doesn't have to

111
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:40,901
be part of life and maybe we could 
actually tolerate the tragedy or maybe 

112
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,350
we could even rise above it and maybe we
could even mitigate it,

113
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:43,670
you know,
because we can.

114
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:47,390
We do that sort of thing all the time 
and so it's always an open question.

115
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,160
When the Eliana and put it very well,
are the floods the consequence of the 

116
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:58,691
fact that things fall apart or are the 
floods of consequence of the fact that 

117
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:03,640
people make mistakes that they know they
shouldn't make and make anyways they 

118
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:05,780
sin?

119
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,400
Right?
And that's to miss the mark,

120
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:12,401
right?
Because that's an archery term to send 

121
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:12,401
in.
That means maybe they don't even specify

122
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:13,400
the damn target,
which is really,

123
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,540
you're not going to hit it unless you 
specified or having specified it.

124
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,880
They just say,
Oh,

125
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:22,160
to hell with it.
It's not that important.

126
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:25,790
It's like you gotta be careful when you 
say something like to hell with it.

127
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,030
It's not that important because one of 
the things that might happen to you if 

128
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,751
you say to hell with it,
it's not that important is that you 

129
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:37,820
might actually end up in hell for a 
pretty prolonged period of time or maybe

130
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:42,821
for the remainder of your miserable 
existence because it's certainly the 

131
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:47,321
case that people do exist there and I've
seen them exists there and once you're 

132
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:48,020
there,
it's no trick.

133
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,050
It's no simple matter to get the hell 
out and so it might matter that the 

134
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,920
things that matter get addressed.

135
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,760
It might matter that you do what you can
to walk with God.

136
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,910
Like I said,
we'll talk more about that next time and

137
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:06,911
it might be that that is how you build 
an ark in are protected from the flood 

138
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:11,390
even if the damn thing comes.
And the thing is it will,

139
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,990
and this is a funny thing too,
that I've noticed about our education 

140
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,771
system and the way we teach students and
their trigger warnings and all of that 

141
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,990
absolute rubbish.
I think in most of my lectures I'd have 

142
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,840
to have a trigger warning every 15 
seconds.

143
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,040
So as I tell my students when they're 
young,

144
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:31,670
it's like,
look,

145
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:36,671
don't fool yourself.
You know you're going to develop a 

146
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:38,390
serious illness,
at least one,

147
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,750
maybe two or three,
and one of them is likely to be chronic 

148
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,180
and if it isn't you,
it's going to be someone you love.

149
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,370
It's going to be your husband,
it's going to be your parent,

150
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:51,371
it's going to be your kids that's coming
and so as a lot of death and pain and so

151
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:57,971
like just exactly what sort of person 
are you going to be when that shows up 

152
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:02,300
and that's the right question.
It isn't how are you going to be happy 

153
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:02,400
in your life?
It's like,

154
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:05,070
good luck with that.
It's a stupid ambition anyways,

155
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:07,140
as far as I'm concerned because it's too
shallow,

156
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,310
you know,
happiness.

157
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:09,690
You're lucky that comes,
uh,

158
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,720
comes and goes,
like the sun coming out from behind the 

159
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:14,720
cloud.
If you're happy,

160
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,210
man,
more power to you,

161
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,980
enjoy it,
enjoy it.

162
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,890
It's a,
it's a gift from the cosmos to be happy,

163
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,140
but at pursuit.
No,

164
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,470
no.
The pursuit is when the dam flood comes,

165
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,430
you want to be the person who built arc 
and that's what the story of Noah is 

166
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,870
about and the thing is the flood is 
always coming.

167
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,740
That's another thing that's worth 
commenting on with regards to this story

168
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:42,741
is you know there's an apocalyptic 
element to the Judeo Christian 

169
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:42,741
tradition.

170
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,370
There's an idea that the end of the 
world is always at hand and that you 

171
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:54,831
should prepare to be judged.
And the thing about that is it's true 

172
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:58,940
and the reason that's true is because 
the end of your world is at hand and it 

173
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:04,821
will certainly come and when it comes,
you will be judged because it will be up

174
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:09,240
to you to figure out what to do with the
fact that your world just collapsed.

175
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,460
And that'll be a moral problem of 
ultimate severity because it'll push you

176
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:19,461
right to your limits and you'll find out
exactly where your unaddressed 

177
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:22,800
weaknesses lie because that's what 
happens in a crisis.

178
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:28,130
And so the reason that that's an 
archetypal reality and it lurks 

179
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,770
underneath the entire Judaeo Christian 
structure,

180
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:30,720
the apocalypse,
the impending apocalypse,

181
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:35,721
is because we always live in apocalyptic
times and your world is always in small 

182
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:40,170
ways and large ways coming to an end.
And so what do you do?

183
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,270
You prepare for it,
you prepare for your world to come to an

184
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:47,670
end,
and then maybe when the end comes,

185
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:50,160
you get another world.
That'd be a good deal.
