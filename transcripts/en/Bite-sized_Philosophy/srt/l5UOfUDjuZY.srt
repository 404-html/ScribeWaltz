1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
The story in the story of Adam and Eve 
is a Meta story and it's a story for two

2
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:11,181
reasons.
One is it's about how stories transform 

3
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:15,260
because Adam and Eve are in this 
unconscious paradise and then it 

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,260
collapses and that happens to every 
potential story,

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,360
right?
That's niches realization.

6
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:19,020
He said,
look,

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,470
imagine that you live within a belief 
system and then something arises to 

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,071
challenge the belief system.
Not only does the belief system 

9
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:28,860
collapse,
but something worse happens.

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,090
Your belief in belief systems collapses,
and that's the road tonight.

11
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:36,480
Now it doesn't have to because you can 
jump from one belief system to another,

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,050
but sometimes that doesn't work is that 
you do a medic critique and you say,

13
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:45,051
oh,
I was living in this protective 

14
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:45,051
structure and it turned out to be 
flawed.

15
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:49,880
Okay?
One alternative is jumped to another 

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:49,880
protective structure.
Fine.

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,590
Another alternative is protective 
structures that themselves are not to be

18
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:53,100
trusted.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,570
Bang,
you're in chaos.

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,280
How the hell are you going to get out of
that?

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,050
That's the pathway.
Denialism.

22
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,030
While you can,
you can.

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,850
You can work your way through that.
That's difficult,

24
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:07,851
or you can do what young would regard as
a soul damaging move and you can 

25
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:12,261
sacrifice your new knowledge and re 
identify with something real rigid and 

26
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:16,641
restricted,
which is what I would say is happening 

27
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:18,951
to some degree with the people in or 
Europe who are turning to a regressive 

28
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:23,340
nationalism as an alternative to to the 
current state of chaos.

29
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,060
It's like I know that that people need 
to identify with local groups.

30
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:32,061
I understand that,
but they risk the danger of making the 

31
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:35,911
state the ultimate God and that's order,
but that's not a good replacement for 

32
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:37,350
chaos.
It's just another kind of catastrophe.

33
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:38,670
Right?
Too much order.

34
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,560
Too much chaos,
both.

35
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:41,520
Catastrophes.

36
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,970
You want to stand in the middle somehow 
and mediate between the two and that's 

37
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,721
where you have your real strength 
because then it isn't that you've 

38
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:53,721
discovered a safe place because even the
bloody right wingers or after a safe 

39
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:54,300
place,
right?

40
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,880
They just want it to be the state.
Yeah,

41
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:57,990
exactly.
Well,

42
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:02,991
there's no safe places and the next 
issue is do you really want a safe 

43
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:03,630
place?
Is that what you want?

44
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,860
You want to be so weak that you want to 
be protected from threat.

45
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,190
What the hell kind of life is that?
You're a paralyzed rabbit in a hole 

46
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,050
that's no life for a human being.
You should be confronting danger and the

47
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:17,700
unknown and mlevel.
It's because,

48
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,330
and the reason for that too is this is 
the weird paradox.

49
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:23,430
This is,
and I believe this is the paradox,

50
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,130
first of all,
that was discovered in part by Buddha,

51
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,860
but also laid forth very clearly in 
Christianity,

52
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:33,861
which is that the PA,
the solution to the problem of tragedy 

53
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:39,891
and malevolence is the willingness to 
face the who the hell would ever guess 

54
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:40,050
that.

55
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,050
It's completely paradoxical.
It's a completely paradoxical 

56
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,570
suggestion,
is that,

57
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,920
well,
why does it work well?

58
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,230
Because the more you confront the two of
them,

59
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:54,231
the more you grow and maybe you can grow
so that you're actually larger than the 

60
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:55,440
chaos and malevolence itself and you 
think,

61
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,820
well,
what's the evidence for that?

62
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,860
And that's easy.
That's what people do.

63
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,130
That is how we learn.
Like every time you expose your child to

64
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:04,900
something new,
a playground,

65
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,080
what are they exposed to?
Chaos and malevolence now there's more 

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,160
to it than that obviously because kids 
play and they,

67
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,450
you know,
they promote each other and they form 

68
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:17,450
friendships and all of that,
but in the playground itself,

69
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,290
there is the complexity of the social 
structure and the malevolence of the 

70
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,311
bully.
It's right there and the q throw your 

71
00:03:26,311 --> 00:03:26,311
kid in there and you say adapt,
and they do.

72
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,260
Okay,
so they can do it at a small scale.

73
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:34,261
It's not trivial,
but the playground is a complicated 

74
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:34,261
place.
The kid can adapt.

75
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:36,160
Well,
how much can you scale that up?

76
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Can you scale that up to from the chaos 
and order and malevolence of the 

77
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:44,860
playground to chaos and order and 
malevolence itself?

78
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,200
Well,
that's the question.

79
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,470
Well,
I don't think there's any reason to 

80
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,650
answer that in the negative,
so because we don't know the full extent

81
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,710
of the human being and it is the problem
that's worked out.

82
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,630
So in the Buddhist story,
for example,

83
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:03,631
what happens after,
so Buddha's world collapses in the same 

84
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:07,291
way that Adam and Eve's world collapses,
it's a consequence of repetitive 

85
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,290
exposure to mortality and death.
What happens to Buddha's?

86
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,340
He realizes that the little protected 
city that his father made for him,

87
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:19,621
the walled garden,
it's exactly the same motif that's in 

88
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:20,740
this Adam and Eve story is,
is it's.

89
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,560
It's what it's.
It's fatally flawed.

90
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,600
That kind of protection cannot exist and
he discovered that in pieces,

91
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,660
right?
Which is exactly what happens to 

92
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:33,660
children is that they go out,
they discover a limit.

93
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,280
They run back and the parents can help 
them with the limit.

94
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,720
They run out,
they discover limit.

95
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:40,660
They run back,
but some at some point they run out,

96
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:45,661
they discover a limit.
They run back and the parents have 

97
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,690
nothing to say to them because they've 
hit the same limit that the parents hit.

98
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,670
Just like,
well,

99
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:50,040
what are you gonna do with your life?
How are you going to.

100
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,780
How are you going to operate in this 
archetipal universe?

101
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,000
While your parents can only say,
well,

102
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:58,660
they can say you identify with the 
proper archetypal figures they do that.

103
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:03,661
They at least act that out for you,
but at some point it's a problem that 

104
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:05,350
they cannot solve for you without making
you weaker.

105
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,480
That's the thing,
you know,

106
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:12,481
so it's an interesting thing that I've 
learned in therapy because one of the 

107
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:16,591
things you have to learn as a therapist 
is how do you not take your client's 

108
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:21,601
problems home with you,
so very common existential problem that 

109
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:24,130
beginning therapists face because 
they're afraid.

110
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:29,131
It's like while you're dealing with 
people all the time who have serious 

111
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:29,131
problems,
sometimes it's mental illness,

112
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:33,930
although less frequently than you think 
and sometimes it's just that they're 

113
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,021
having a good catastrophe right there.
Their parents have cancer or something 

114
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:41,431
like that,
or their father has Alzheimer's and 

115
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:43,081
they're unemployed.
They have a drug problem or they have a 

116
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:44,950
schizophrenia zonar like these aren't 
mental illness problems,

117
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:46,540
right?
Those are just catastrophes.

118
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,600
And so people are discussing those with 
you all the time.

119
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,990
How do you avoid being crushed by that 
or avoid taking it home?

120
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,140
And the answer to that is you don't 
steal the problem that that's the 

121
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,140
answer.

122
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,430
It's like you have some problems.
If you come and talk to me,

123
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:03,560
I'll help you figure out how to solve 
them.

124
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,710
I will not tell you how to solve.
I won't steal your problems because what

125
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:10,820
we're trying to do in therapy is number 
one,

126
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:15,350
so your problem number two,
turn you into a great solver of problems

127
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,500
and the second one is way more important
than the first one,

128
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,740
and so you never solve someone's problem
by removing from them the opportunity to

129
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:25,940
solve their problem.
That's theft.

130
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,970
That's the eatables situation.
That's the eatables situation.

131
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,570
That's the over protective mother.
No father can play that role too.

132
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,910
We're talking about architectural 
representations.

133
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,690
It's like all protect you at the cost of
your ability to protect yourself.

134
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,970
No wrong.
That's that.

135
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,150
That's a sin.
That's a good way of thinking about it.

136
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:47,480
That is not what you do with people,
not with your children,

137
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:49,760
not with your partner,
not with yourself.

138
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,030
You don't do that.
That destroys people's adaptive 

139
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,121
competence and it and it disarms them in
the face of chaos and malevolence and 

140
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:59,610
that's a terrible,
you know,

141
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,820
send someone out are unarmed in a world 
like that,

142
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:07,510
it's a terrible thing to do so.
And if people aren't strong enough to 

143
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,981
manage it,
then they get resentful and then when 

144
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:11,981
you get the downhill spiral that goes 
along with that.

145
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,770
Okay,
so the Med is story is partly you're in 

146
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:17,770
a mat,
you're,

147
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,180
you have a map,
but it's insufficient and things will 

148
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,431
come up to disrupt it.
And sometimes the disruption is 

149
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:24,560
catastrophic.
Everything falls apart.

150
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,950
That's what happens to the Buddha.
And that's what happens to Adam and eve 

151
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,950
and the rest of the biblical stories are
actually an attempt to put that back 

152
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,760
together.
Now that that's been assembled,

153
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:37,370
as I said,
it's been assembled over centuries.

154
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,210
Right?
Okay.

155
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:41,600
We've got the problem.
The problem is the apocalypse,

156
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,350
the ever present reality of the 
apocalyptic fall,

157
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,510
that's the problem.
And so you could say,

158
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:52,511
well what is that?
It's the insufficiency of all potential 

159
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:52,730
conceptual schemes,
right?

160
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,940
Your conceptual schemes are insufficient
to deal with the complexity of the 

161
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:57,940
world.
It's a permanent problem.

162
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,130
So what do you do?
You stop relying on your conceptual 

163
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:03,130
schemes.
That's part of the answer.

164
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,110
You start relying on your instead on 
your ability to actively generate 

165
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,061
conceptual schemes in the face of chaos.
And malevolence and so that makes you 

166
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:17,180
someone that identifies with your 
creative capacity,

167
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:21,290
your creative,
courageous capacity for articulation and

168
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:26,291
action in the face of the unknown rather
than some formulaic approach to the 

169
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:30,641
territory and that is not.
And that the idea is that that elevates 

170
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:34,991
your character to the point where you 
can withstand tragedy and malevolence 

171
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:38,681
without becoming corrupt and that 
provides a permanent solution to the 

172
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:38,681
problem.

173
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,940
Well then you might say,
cynically,

174
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,360
what's your evidence that that's a 
permanent solution and answer that is 

175
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,740
while the evidence isn't all in yet,
first of all,

176
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:53,741
because people only live that way 
partially and so we haven't put the 

177
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:58,061
hypothesis to the full test and second,
we don't know what our limitations are.

178
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,130
We have no idea what our limitations are
and they're,

179
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,830
they're both greater and lesser than we 
imagined because you know,

180
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:09,831
you have to ask yourself like if people 
stopped adding voluntarily to the misery

181
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:14,160
of the world and devoted themselves to 
setting things straight,

182
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:16,620
setting themselves straight and setting 
the things around them straight,

183
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,980
what would happen?
And the answer to that is,

184
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,340
well,
there'd be a hell of a lot less 

185
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,321
unnecessary misery in the world,
so that might not be a bad place to 

186
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:27,321
start.
But apart from that,

187
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:32,301
there's very little that we can say,
could we overcome the catastrophe of 

188
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:32,301
mortality?

189
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,730
Why not?
You think that's beyond our capacity?

190
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,150
Could we make the world a place where no
one was suffering any more than 

191
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,730
necessary and still allow the world to 
exist?

192
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,970
Well,
possibly because we don't know the 

193
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,101
limitations of our capacity.
We're only running at 40 percent if 

194
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:51,120
that.
I would say if we don't make full use of

195
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:56,121
all the people that are in the world,
we don't have our situation set up so 

196
00:09:56,121 --> 00:10:00,231
that the gifts that they could offer to 
everyone are fully realized.

197
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,610
We haven't set the systems up for that 
yet.

198
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:06,390
So we waste people like mad and then we 
waste ourselves like mad.
