1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,370
One of the things you want to do with 
the conception,

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:07,371
like compassionate as you actually want 
to start thinking about it like a 

3
00:00:07,371 --> 00:00:09,860
psychologist or like a scientist,
because compassion is actually definable

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,530
and it.
I think the easiest way to approach it 

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:15,620
is to think about it in big five terms 
because it.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,720
It maps onto agreeableness and 
especially you can break agreeableness 

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,910
down into compassion and politeness and 
the liberal types,

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,030
especially the social justice types are 
way higher in compassion.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,240
It's actually their fundamental 
characteristic and you might think,

10
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:32,130
well,
compassion is is a virtue.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,210
It's like,
yes,

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,540
it is average you,
but any unit,

13
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:41,541
dimensional virtue immediately becomes a
vice because real virtue is the 

14
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,710
intermingling of a number of virtues and
their and their integration into a 

15
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:50,220
functional identity that can be 
expressed socially and compassion.

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,950
Passion is great if you happen to be the
entity towards which it is directive,

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,340
but compassion tends to divide the world
into a crying children and predatory 

18
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:02,670
snakes.

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,220
Right?
And so if you're a crying child,

20
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:06,330
hey,
great man,

21
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,750
but if you happen to be identified as 
one of the predatory snakes,

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,810
you better look the hell out.
And so,

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,060
you know,
compassionate is what the mother,

24
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:19,260
grizzly bear feels for her cubs when she
eats you because you've got in the way.

25
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,910
Right?
Exactly.

26
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:25,100
So we don't want to be thinking for a 
second that compassion isn't a,

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,320
uh,
a virtue that could lead to violence 

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,410
because it certainly can't.
And the other problem with compassion,

29
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,220
this is why we have conscientiousness,
right?

30
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,830
There's five canonical personality 
dimensions.

31
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,870
Agreeableness is pretty good if you're 
dealing,

32
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:41,850
again,
in akin system,

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,370
you want to distribute resources 
equally,

34
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,900
for example,
among your children,

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,960
because you want all of them to have not
only the same chance you even walk them 

36
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,330
roughly to have the same outcome,
a good one,

37
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,870
but the problem is you can't extend that
moral network to larger groups.

38
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,970
Not as far as I can tell.
You need conscientiousness,

39
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:04,971
which is a much colder virtue.
And it's also a virtue that's much more 

40
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:08,700
concerned with larger structures over 
the longer period of time.

41
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,480
So,
and you can take about conscientiousness

42
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:14,790
is a form of compassion to.
It's a strange form.

43
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:18,090
It's like straighten the hell out and 
work hard and your life will go well.

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,240
It's like,
I don't care how your feelings,

45
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,310
how you feel about that right now.
And like someone who's cold low in 

46
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,600
agreeableness and high in 
conscientiousness,

47
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:29,340
that's what they'll tell you every time.
Don't,

48
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,980
don't come whining to me.
I don't care about your hurt feelings.

49
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,440
Do Your Goddamn job.
Are you going to be out on the street?

50
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,250
It's like,
oh,

51
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:38,040
that person's being really hard on me.
It's like not necessarily.

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,210
They might have your long term best 
interest in mind and you're fortunate if

53
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:47,211
you come across someone who's like not 
too radically disagreeable but 

54
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:52,070
moderately disagreeable and high in 
conscientiousness because the whip you 

55
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,070
into shape.

56
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,450
And that's really helpful.
I mean you,

57
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,000
you'll admire people like that.
You won't be able to help it,

58
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,840
you know,
and you think,

59
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:02,841
oh wow,
this person's going to be good 

60
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:04,880
inflammation even though you know,
you feel like a slug after you after 

61
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,820
they've taken you apart.
So.

62
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,740
Okay,
so that's the compassion issue.

63
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:13,330
It's like you can't just transform that 
into a political stance and I think part

64
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:18,331
of what we're seeing is actually the 
rise of a form of female 

65
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,061
totalitarianism,
so we have no idea what totalitarianism 

66
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:25,051
would be like if women ran it because 
that's never happened before in the 

67
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:29,221
history of the planet and so we've 
introduced women into the political 

68
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:33,151
sphere radically over the last 50 years.
We have no idea what the consequences of

69
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:35,680
that is going to be,
but we do know from our research,

70
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:40,681
which is preliminary,
that agreeableness really predicts 

71
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:44,641
political correctness,
but female gender predicts over and 

72
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,301
above the personality trait and that's 
something we found very rarely in our 

73
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:51,871
research.
Usually the sex differences are wiped 

74
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:53,020
out by the personality differences,
but not in this particular case.

75
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,500
And then you know,
women are getting married later and 

76
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,741
they're having children much later and 
they're having fewer of them and so you 

77
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,951
also have to wonder what their feminine 
orientation is doing with itself in the 

78
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,440
interim.
Roughly speaking,

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,020
and a lot of it's being expressed as 
political opinion,

80
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,700
like in fair enough.
You know,

81
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,900
that's,
that's fine,

82
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,710
but it's not fine.
When it starts to shut down discussion.
