1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,900
This is the Peter Pan Story,
roughly speaking is Peter Pan is this 

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,790
magical boy.
Pan means Pan is the god of everything,

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,930
roughly speaking,
right?

4
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:14,760
And so it's not an accident that he has 
the name Pan and he's the boy that won't

5
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:16,860
grow up and he's magical.
Well,

6
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:19,880
that's because children are magical.
They can be anything there,

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,890
nothing but potential,
and Peter Pan doesn't want to give that 

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,440
up.
Why?

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,630
Well,
he's got some adults around them,

10
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:30,600
but the main adult is captain hook.
Well,

11
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,580
who the hell wants to grow up to be 
Captain Hark?

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,140
First of all,
you've got a hook.

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,070
Second year a tyrant and third,
you're chased by the dragon of chaos 

14
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,120
with a clock in its stomach,
right?

15
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:44,010
The crocodile.
It's already got a piece of you.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,590
Well,
that's what happens when you get older.

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,650
Time has already got a piece of you and 
eventually it's going to taste for you 

18
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,530
and eventually it's going to eat you.

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,930
And so the hook is so traumatized by 
that that he can't help but be a tyrant.

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,590
And then Peter Parent looks out 
traumatized Herc and says,

21
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:02,040
well,
no,

22
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,080
I'm not sacrificing my childhood for 
that.

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,880
So that's fine,
except he ends up,

24
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:09,210
can you lost Boyz in Neverland?
Well,

25
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:12,480
Neverland doesn't exist and who the hell
wants to be king of the lost boys.

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,080
And he also sacrifice is the possibility
that a hell of a real relationship with 

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,681
a woman because that's Wendy Wright and 
she's kind of conservative middle class 

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,840
London dwelling girl.
She wants to grow up and have kids and 

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,150
have a life.
She accepts her mortality.

30
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:32,151
She accepts her maturity.
Peter Pan as to contend himself with 

31
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:34,500
tinkerbell.
She doesn't even exist.

32
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,070
She's like,
she's like the fairy of porn.

33
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,050
She doesn't exist.
She's the substitute for the real thing.

34
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,860
And so,
but the dichotomy that you're talking 

35
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,201
about,
it's very tricky because there's a 

36
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:51,630
sacrificial element in maturation,
right?

37
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,630
You have to sacrifice the pleura 
potentiality of childhood for the 

38
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,140
actuality of a frame.
And the question is,

39
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:02,220
well,
why would you do that?

40
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:07,221
Well,
one reason is it happens to you whether 

41
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:09,261
you do it or not,
you can either choose your damn 

42
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:11,811
limitation or you can let it take you 
unaware when you're 30 or even worse 

43
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:17,460
when you're 40 and then that is not a 
happy day.

44
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,910
You see,
I see people like this and I think it's 

45
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,250
more and more common in our culture 
because people can put off matt maturity

46
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,550
without suffering and immediate penalty,
but all that happens is the penalty 

47
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,760
accrues and then when it finally hits it
just wallops you because when you're 25 

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,680
you can be an idiot.
It's no problem.

49
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,500
Even when you're out in a job search,
it's like,

50
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,450
well you don't have any experience in.
You're kind of clueless.

51
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:39,810
It's,
yeah,

52
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,770
you're young,
you know,

53
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:41,760
it's no problem.
We can.

54
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,280
That's what young people are like,
but they're full of potential.

55
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,710
Okay,
well now you're the same person at 30.

56
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,950
It's like people aren't so thrilled 
about you at that point.

57
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,220
It's like,
what the hell have you been doing for 

58
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,220
the last 10 years?
Well,

59
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,230
I'm just as clueless as I was when I was
22.

60
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:55,830
So.
Yeah.

61
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,160
But you're not 22,
you're an old infant,

62
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,340
right?
And that's an ugly thing and all the 

63
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,400
incident.
So the the reason,

64
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,460
part of the reason you choose your damn 
sacrifice because the sacrifice is 

65
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,420
inevitable,
but at least you get to choose it.

66
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:18,421
And then there's something that's even 
more complex than that in some sense is 

67
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:22,261
that the problem with being a child is 
that all you are is potential and it's 

68
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:27,361
really low resolution.
You could be anything but you're not 

69
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:27,361
anything.

70
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:28,960
So then you go and you do adopt an 
apprenticeship,

71
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,560
roughly speaking,
and then you become at least you become 

72
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,650
something.
And when you're something that makes the

73
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:37,690
world opened up to you again,
you know,

74
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:42,691
like if you're a really good plumber,
then you ended up being far more than a 

75
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:42,790
plumber,
right?

76
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,500
You end up being a good employer.
Not,

77
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:49,501
not that plumbers are not putting 
plumber stale and it's like more power 

78
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:50,350
to plumbers.
They've saved more lives than doctors.

79
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,050
So hygiene,
right?

80
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:55,510
So you know,
if you're a really good plumber,

81
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:57,580
well then you have some employees,
you run a business,

82
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,980
you make,
you train some other people,

83
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:04,981
you enlarge their lives,
you're kind of a pillar of the 

84
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:04,981
community,
you have your family,

85
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:09,331
it's you can once you pass through that 
narrow training period which narrows you

86
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:13,000
and constricts you and develops you at 
the same time,

87
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:18,001
then you can come out the other end with
a bunch of new possibility at help at 

88
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:21,841
hand and young talked about that,
a thought that the proper part of the 

89
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:27,571
proper path of development in the last 
half of life was to rediscover that 

90
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:30,790
child that you left behind as you were 
apprenticing.

91
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,670
And so then you get to be something and 
regain that potential at the same time.

92
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,870
Very,
very smart.

93
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,620
Well,
he was very,

94
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:41,200
very smart.
So that's very wise,

95
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,640
very wise thing to know.
So Yep.

96
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,790
Sacrifice.
We'll,

97
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,800
we'll talk more about that too.
You get to pick your damn sacrifice.

98
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,370
That's all.
You don't get to not make what your 

99
00:04:59,370 --> 00:04:59,440
sacrificial,
whether you want to be or not.

100
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,280
That's a good thing to know as well.
So even though it's rather rough thing 

101
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,720
to figure out,
but other questions

102
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,870
I have no one else.

103
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,900
Okay.
That thing you just said about noticing 

104
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:22,900
and more and more and people live into 
their 20 [inaudible] yeah.

105
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,300
What do you think about that or anything
that comes from in terms of culture,

106
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:27,780
we live in,

107
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,450
think universities facilitate it because
you can go to university to not be 

108
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:38,931
something instead of going to university
to be something and that's it's pleasure

109
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:39,450
island

110
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,800
and the price you pay for it,
especially in the U.

111
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,070
S is debt and you're enticed into it 
because the administrators can pick your

112
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:53,071
pocket.
So they they rob your future self while 

113
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:55,150
allowing you to pretend that you have an
identity.

114
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,190
Right?
Very,

115
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,710
and you can't declare bankruptcy with 
your student loans.

116
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:05,711
In the US,
it's indentured servitude and it is 

117
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:06,620
precisely pleasure island.
It's exactly that.

118
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,280
And so tuition fees have shot way out of
control and part of the reason that 

119
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,541
universities don't make more demands on 
their students and let them get away 

120
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,380
with all the things they let them get 
away with is because they're basically,

121
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,920
why the hell would you chase them out?
They're $100,000

122
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,550
or more so they can do whatever they 
want as long as you get to sell them to 

123
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,430
the salt mines.

124
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:30,890
Right.

125
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,940
Did you know it's not the only reason 
because the other thing that's happened 

126
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,041
is that the rate of technological 
transformation is so fast now and the 

127
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,341
rate of turnover of things is that it's.
It is genuinely harder for people who 

128
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:46,570
are say 18 to 20.
When I was a kid,

129
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,970
roughly speaking,
the kind of rough patch for,

130
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,210
for,
for life was probably 14 to 17,

131
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,980
something like that.
Now it's,

132
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,920
I think it's 18 to 25,
something like that.

133
00:06:56,921 --> 00:07:01,921
And I think the reason for that is that 
all of the jobs that the bloody hippies 

134
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,140
complained about being doomed to in the 
19 sixties have now disappeared.

135
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,070
There.
Problem was,

136
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:11,130
oh my God,
I'm going to have to work for a 

137
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,230
corporation and get a salary for the 
rest of my life,

138
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,900
you know,
and then I'll just end up with a pension

139
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,000
and that'll be my whole life.
It's like,

140
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:21,001
well,
it seems like a lot better deal than an 

141
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,450
endless round of part time starbucks 
jobs.

142
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,700
So,
you know,

143
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:27,520
some of it is that it's,
it's just,

144
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,420
it's,
it's,

145
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,560
there's a space now in our culture that,
that is lacking for people to make that 

146
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,960
transformation from,
from adolescence into adulthood.

147
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,800
And so it's just,
it's,

148
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,210
it's the cost of that is stalled.
It's not a good thing.
