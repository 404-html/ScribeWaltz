1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,570
And that sort of,
that's where the West is powerful.

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:08,571
I would say like we have a really well 
developed mythology of the exploratory 

3
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:09,300
hero,
but where we're not so well developed is

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,630
the second part because in the second 
part of the classic Hero's story,

5
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:17,631
you're supposed to come back and 
communicate about what you found and so 

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,240
there's a individual exploration element
and then there's a communicate and 

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,410
update the culture element and both of 
those are equally important and it's 

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,150
something that we don't do well.
We don't have much respect for tradition

9
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:35,151
in the west and it's a really,
really big problem because the ethical 

10
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:39,090
responsibility of a human being is to 
take the dead culture so that's the dead

11
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:44,091
father or the Dad God,
and to revivify it with attention and 

12
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,470
communication and you've failed to do 
that.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,100
Then everything disappears.
And we we are failing to do that.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,520
We're leaving it all behind instead.
It's not a good idea.

15
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,410
You know,
if the old gods die,

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,930
as Nietzsche said,
they had new gods swoop in very rapidly,

17
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:04,770
and if you think the old guard was bad,
you wait until the new gods get ahold of

18
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:09,771
you.
So while we saw what happened in the 

19
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:09,771
20th century,
right,

20
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:14,601
with all the ideologies that sprang up 
in the absence of classical religious 

21
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:14,601
belief,
it's like,

22
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:16,860
okay,
you're not so thrilled with Catholicism.

23
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:18,410
If you think about that is,
you know,

24
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,940
the fundamental tradition of the West,
you know,

25
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:23,250
with the witch burnings and the 
inquisition and all that,

26
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:23,820
it's like,
yeah,

27
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:28,821
yeah,
well get a load of the Nazis and then 

28
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:28,821
see what you think.
So,

29
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:32,780
or the communists for that matter.
It's like from bad to worse in an 

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,660
unimaginable way,
you know,

31
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,690
so,
and it's partly because those archaic 

32
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,300
systems,
those are religious systems,

33
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,440
they weren't ideologies.

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,440
There are a whole different class of 
thing and we don't understand them very 

35
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,180
well and it's not good because you 
cannot live without understanding them.

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,360
You don't know who you are.
And then you fall prey to weird mental 

37
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,420
diseases like nihilism.
That's one.

38
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,650
Another one is ideological possession.
So you become a totalitarian or an 

39
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,190
analyst and that's a bad outcome and you
might think,

40
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,420
well,
what's the alternative?

41
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,850
Well,
you know what happens in Pinocchio,

42
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:10,080
right?
You've watched Pinocchio.

43
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,410
Okay.
I often show up in oak you to this 

44
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:15,410
class,
but I don't know if I'm going to do that

45
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:15,410
this year.
But anyways,

46
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,930
but now he's a puppet marionette.
Someone else's pulling his strings has,

47
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,940
it wouldn't head.
He's not very bright.

48
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,740
He hasn't banged around the world at 
all.

49
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,340
He's not a good father.
The old Japan who really would rather 

50
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,340
that he was a real boy,
right?

51
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,300
A real person.
So he's the kind of father that wants to

52
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:34,080
produce an individual and not a slave.
So.

53
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:35,040
And that's why,
you know,

54
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,250
in his workshop it's all friendly and 
there's a nice fire and he's making toys

55
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,100
and there's lots of music.
It's like go Japan.

56
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:41,070
Oh,
he's a good guy.

57
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,810
So it makes this little puppet and he 
sends them out in the world,

58
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,450
says,
go be a real boy.

59
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,930
Well,
Pinocchio runs into a whole class of 

60
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,300
different obstacles.
One is evil,

61
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,590
right?
That's the,

62
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,330
uh,
that's the coachman.

63
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,690
And the Italian stereotype guy who makes
him a dancing puppets celebrity,

64
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,720
which I think is pretty funny.
I mean that's really prescient,

65
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,550
you know,
because you might think,

66
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:11,551
well,
what's the goal of your typical bone 

67
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:11,551
headed?
You know,

68
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:14,350
mid adolescent in North America.
It's like unearned celebrity.

69
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,770
Well that's exactly what Pinocchio goes 
for first and that doesn't work out so 

70
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:19,930
well because he ends up with slave.

71
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,930
And then the next thing that happens is 
he capitalizes on the fact that he's 

72
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,911
vulnerable and pretends he's sick and 
goes off for a vacation under the 

73
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:33,001
direction of the coachman who's 
basically Satan in disguise and it goes 

74
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:34,120
out to treasure island,
pleasure island,

75
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,330
and meets all the delinquent.
So we're just like Nazis.

76
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:41,560
And it turns out that in fact,
the whole ploy is to enslave everyone to

77
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,410
deprive them of their voice.
That's the donkey's brain.

78
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,740
And to make them into slaves pretty damn
horrifying.

79
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:52,741
And that was,
that movie came out about the same time 

80
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:54,490
that the Nazis were really grasping 
power in,

81
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,670
in central Europe.
It's like they got it exactly right.

82
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,340
Here's what's really going on behind the
scenes.

83
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,960
So.
And then what happens?

84
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:06,961
Well,
Pinocchio turns halfway into a brain 

85
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:09,091
donkey because you know,
he's gone off the path and in order to 

86
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:09,280
get back on it,
he tries to go home,

87
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,690
but it's too late.

88
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,160
He's grown up.
You can't go home.

89
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,380
He's not a kid anymore.
Goes home and dad,

90
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:16,060
isn't there surprise,
surprise,

91
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:18,310
because once you grow up and you go 
home,

92
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,820
dad isn't there.
It's just another human being.

93
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,150
So then what happens?
Well then he has to go into the ocean.

94
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,950
Now that's particularly weird,
right?

95
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,660
It's like there he is,
half donkey.

96
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:33,661
He's a puppet.
The dove comes down and drops him a 

97
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:35,260
message from God.
It's like the Holy Spirit descending,

98
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:37,990
except it's actually from the blue fairy
weirdly enough.

99
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,620
And the message says,
you have to go to the deepest part of 

100
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:43,620
the ocean and rescue your father.
It's like,

101
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,560
yeah,
that is what you have to do.

102
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:47,530
If you don't want to be a bloody puppet 
donkey,

103
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,040
you have to go down into the depths and 
find your dead father and you have to 

104
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,160
revivify him.
And that's what happened.

105
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,050
So Pinocchio goes way down there to the 
deepest depths and finds monster who's a

106
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,840
monster.
So terrible that the fish swim away just

107
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:03,880
at the sound of his voice,
just like,

108
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,190
what's his name?
Uh,

109
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,960
he who,
who,

110
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:09,880
you shall not be named Voldemort,
right?

111
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:13,120
You can't even say his damn name.
Same with monster.

112
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,730
Put Ohio goes down there.
It goes into the whale.

113
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,840
What happens?
Japan?

114
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:20,950
Oh,
says there's no getting out with this.

115
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:25,951
There's no getting out of this.
We just have to sit here and Cook Fish 

116
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,621
and Pinocchio Thinks Cook.
And then he starts breaking up all the 

117
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:29,660
chairs and everything and his father 
freaking out.

118
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:30,420
It's like,
what are you doing?

119
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,260
Breaking all these chairs?
What are we going to sit on?

120
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,620
And then Pinocchio Lights them on fire.
He's a master of fire.

121
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:39,040
It's a shamonic ritual,
but he is a master of fire.

122
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,680
That's what human being as he.

123
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,020
He gets everything burning.
Of course,

124
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,030
Jupiter pedals all freaked out about 
that because what are they going to sit 

125
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,030
on?
An Pinocchio?

126
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,030
Thanks.
Who Cares about setting?

127
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,310
We're going to solve the problem once 
and for all.

128
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,340
And so then the whale turns into a fire 
breathing driving,

129
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:56,410
which is pretty damn weird thing for a 
whale to do.

130
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,520
Half Pinocchio,
he lived,

131
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,190
washes up on shore dead,
but he saves his father.

132
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,490
Then at the very end of the movie,
he's lying on his bed,

133
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,810
all drowned.
They're all like having a show.

134
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,810
He's a dead pop it now.
It's like,

135
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:10,110
do you want to be alive?
Popular?

136
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,480
A dead puppet.
Well,

137
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:13,840
maybe the dead puppet is better than the
life puppet.

138
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,460
It depends on where you're going.
So then he's on the bed,

139
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,110
the blue fairy comes down and says,
well,

140
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,270
you've been honest and courageous.
Bang.

141
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,210
Now you're real.
You know?

142
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,710
And then they have a little party and 
that's,

143
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,800
that's just exactly right.
Exactly right.

144
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,180
So that's how.
That's part of the hero mythology is the

145
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:35,090
rescuing of the father after rescue the 
father.

146
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,720
Because otherwise you're a corpse.
Like you're a historical creature.

147
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,510
You're a cultural creature.
You're a,

148
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,800
you cannot live without your culture.
You think you can,

149
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:56,801
but you can't.
It disappears in and you don't even 

150
00:06:56,801 --> 00:07:00,250
look.
I'll give you an example in the 

151
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,531
Mesopotamian creation myth,
which I'm going to tell you about next 

152
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:05,320
week,
one of the things that happens is that 

153
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,830
the first round of gods,
so they're like primordial forces.

154
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,100
They're pretty damn careless and they 
killed their father and they make this 

155
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,060
place to live on his corpse.
Okay?

156
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:19,061
That's where we live.
We live on the corpse of our ancestors 

157
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:20,230
because we live in this society.
It's dad,

158
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,330
it's the product of dead people,
so he's gotten his ged element,

159
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:25,130
but we're living on it.
Okay?

160
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,170
There are very careless.
They kill it.

161
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:28,250
They sold it,
they leave,

162
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,230
render it completely dead.
Well,

163
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:33,560
what happens is tire Matt,
who's the mother of chaos,

164
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:35,960
she comes flooding back and she thinks,
oh,

165
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:38,090
you killed the thing that protects you.

166
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,240
You just wait to see what happens and 
that's exactly.

167
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,220
Yet you killed the thing that structures
you.

168
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,560
You will know it.
It's like niches,

169
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,800
prediction from the death of God.
It's like you killed this.

170
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,900
You think are.
It doesn't make any difference.

171
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:51,830
It's like,
ha,

172
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,130
wrong.
It's like the striders protecting the 

173
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,491
hobbits.
You get rid of that thing that protects 

174
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:00,491
you in chaos,
comes flooding in and you like.

175
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:02,990
You have no idea what's possible.
We do though,

176
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:04,550
because we lived through the 20th 
century,

177
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,370
we know exactly what's possible.
You know,

178
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,400
hundreds of millions of unnecessary 
deaths.

179
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,640
That's what's possible.
We're lucky we didn't blow the whole 

180
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:15,640
damn thing up,
so when we still could,

181
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,710
so people pursuing their dead 
etiologies.

182
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,040
You don't rescue the dead father.
You're the puppet of death.

183
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,330
That's what you are.
On that cheery note.
