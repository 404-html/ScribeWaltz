1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:03,710
Good

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,090
for decades,
ethnic groups have,

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:13,091
on average,
scored significantly differently on Iq 

4
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:16,151
tests.
According to psychology professor 

5
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:19,211
Richard Harris,
whom you interviewed on your channel 

6
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:19,430
Youtube,
there was no scientific consensus on the

7
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:22,490
causes of these average differences in 
Iq test scores.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,110
Yet,
according to Haier,

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,350
psychologists do generally agree that 
general intelligence exists that Iq 

10
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:34,721
measures that well and in a non 
culturally biased way that Iq is highly 

11
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:39,641
predictive of success and educational 
and professional terms and that for 

12
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:41,420
decades,
ethnic groups have on average,

13
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:45,080
scored significantly differently.
So assuming this is true,

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,140
should we talk about it?
Sam Harris raised this question and a 

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,140
podcast conversation with Charles 
Murray.

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,860
Some argue that we should not talk about
this as doing so could fuel the racial 

17
00:00:57,051 --> 00:01:01,370
supremacist movements that you mentioned
with potentially horrific consequences.

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,820
Others mainly on the intellectual dark 
web and to a very limited extent in 

19
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:11,831
academia.
I think we should talk about this topic 

20
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:13,580
because average differences in Iq scores
have existed for decades.

21
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,200
They may have played a role in 
generating the disparate educational and

22
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:21,380
professional outcomes that we observe 
and care about,

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,860
and thus that we cannot properly analyze
these disparate outcomes unless we do 

24
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,590
talk about the subject openly.
Geneticists,

25
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,630
David Reich recently argued in the New 
York Times that have scientists do not 

26
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,070
openly discuss the biological basis of 
race.

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,540
Pseudo scientists could fill the vacuum 
with dangerous consequences.

28
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,190
Furthermore,
you,

29
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:48,191
Professor Peterson are highly critical 
of the oppression narrative that 

30
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:52,841
permeates segments of the academy and 
activist left and knowledge about 

31
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:56,450
average differences in Iq scores between
ethnic groups,

32
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,990
while tough to assimilate could puncture
this narrative.

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,560
So the question is,
what is your view on all that?

34
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:05,270
I've just said,
Jesus,

35
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,220
you guys already didn't take a long time
to prepare these questions.

36
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:08,640
Didn't know.

37
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,770
Alright,
so

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,240
when I went to Harvard,
I came from mcgill and I had spent a lot

39
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:25,881
of time with my advisor there and a 
research team that he had trying to 

40
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:32,151
understand the genesis of antisocial 
behavior and him among adolescents,

41
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:38,481
mostly so well as kids as well.
It's antisocial behavior is very 

42
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:42,771
persistent.
So if you have a child whose conduct 

43
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:45,051
disordered at the age of four,
the probability that they will be 

44
00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:48,030
criminal at the age of 15 or 20 is 
extremely high.

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,120
It's unbelievably stable.
It's a very dismal literature because 

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,230
you see these early onset aggressive 
kids and and it's persistent and then 

47
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:03,201
you look at the intervention literature 
and you throw up your hands because no 

48
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:07,381
interventions work and believe me,
psychologists have tried everything you 

49
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:10,921
could possibly imagine and a bunch of 
things that you can't in order to 

50
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:14,641
ameliorate that.
So we're really interested in trying to 

51
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:14,641
understand,
for example,

52
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,920
if you're antisocial by the age of four,
then there isn't an intervention that 

53
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,320
seems to be effective.

54
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,340
So,
and the standard penal logical theory is

55
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:29,341
really quite horrifying in this regard 
because what you see is that male 

56
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:33,241
aggression peaks around the age of 15 
and then it declines fairly 

57
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:33,241
precipitously and,
and,

58
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,640
and sort of normalizes again by the age 
of 27.

59
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:40,180
And Standard penal logical theory 
essentially is this cold hearted.

60
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:45,181
It's like if you have a mold,
if you have someone who is a multiple 

61
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:48,451
offender,
you just throw them in prison til 

62
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:48,451
they're 27,
then the age out of it,

63
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:51,580
and that's all there is to it.
That's what we've got.

64
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,060
Now,
there's some downside to that because 

65
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,771
there's a corollary literature that 
suggests that the worst thing that you 

66
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,230
can do with antisocial people is to 
group them together,

67
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,690
which is what we do in prisons.
So,

68
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,490
so that's a whole mess.
Anyways.

69
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,240
One of the things we were doing was 
trying to see if there might be 

70
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,850
cognitive predictors of antisocial 
behavior.

71
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,850
And so we use this battery of 
neuropsychological tests that was put 

72
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,970
together at the Montreal Neurological 
Institute,

73
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,180
took about 11 hours to administer and 
hypothetically assessed prefrontal 

74
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,170
cortical function.
We computerized that,

75
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:28,171
reduced it to about 90 minutes and then 
assessed antisocial adolescents in 

76
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,400
Montreal and found out that they did 
show deficits in problem solving ability

77
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,230
that we were associated with,
uh,

78
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,880
with prefrontal ability.
Um,

79
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,510
when I got to Harvard,
I thought,

80
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:41,560
well,
that's interesting.

81
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,750
We could use the neuro psych battery to 
predict negative behavior.

82
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,210
Perhaps we could use it to predict 
positive behavior.

83
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:51,010
So I thought,
well,

84
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:55,360
what if we turned the neuro psych 
battery and over and thought,

85
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,650
well,
can we predict grades,

86
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:57,910
for example,
because you know,

87
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,030
that's a decent thing to predict.
So we ran a study,

88
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,000
we ran a study that looked at Harvard 
kids,

89
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:09,001
University of Toronto kids line workers 
at a Milwaukee factory and managers and 

90
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,170
executives at the same factory.

91
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,170
And what we found was that the average 
score across these neuropsychological 

92
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,430
tests,
they were kind of like games.

93
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,660
They were game like,
you know.

94
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:22,350
So in one,
in one test you had,

95
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,650
there were five lights in the middle of 
the screen and a box was associated with

96
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,960
each light and you had to learn by trial
and error,

97
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,330
which box was associated with,
with each light.

98
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,550
That was one of the tests.
Um,

99
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,210
so we took people's average score across
the tests because they seem to clump 

100
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:42,820
together into a single structure.
You can do,

101
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,550
you can find that out statistically.
If you take a bunch of tests,

102
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,850
you can find out how they clumped 
together statistically by looking at 

103
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,520
their patterns of correlations.
And you might get multiple clumps,

104
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:54,940
which is what happens with personality 
research where you get five or you might

105
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:57,100
get a singular clump,
which is what happens.

106
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,980
Cognitive research.
And we got a single clump essentially.

107
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,430
And then we were trying to figure out if
at the same time I was reading the 

108
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,631
literature on performance prediction and
there's an extensive literature on 

109
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:14,561
performance prediction,
a lot of it generated by the armed 

110
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:14,561
forces,
by the way,

111
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:17,360
I'm indicating that ICU is a very good 
predictor of longterm life success.

112
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,690
And so here's the,
here's the general rule.

113
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,860
If your job is simple,
which means you do the same thing every 

114
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,590
day than Iq predicts how fast you'll 
learn the job,

115
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:31,100
but not how well you do it.
But if your job is complex,

116
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,220
which means that the demands change on 
an ongoing basis,

117
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:37,280
then the best predictor of success is 
general cognitive ability.

118
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,060
And uh,
and I learned that the general cognitive

119
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:46,061
ability tests clump together into a 
single factor that's fluid intelligence 

120
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:49,980
or Iq.
And then we didn't know if the factor 

121
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,680
that we had found was the same factor as
Iq and it.

122
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,590
And we still haven't really figured out 
whether or not that was the case because

123
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:56,540
it kind of depends on how you do the 
analysis.

124
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,840
But anyways,
I got deeply into the performance 

125
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,631
prediction literature and I found out,
well if you wanted to predict people's 

126
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:04,631
performance in life,
there's,

127
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:05,750
there's a couple of things you need to 
know.

128
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:07,610
You need to know their general cognitive
ability.

129
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:11,150
If they're going to do a complex job,
you need to know their trait.

130
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:16,151
Conscientiousness,
some of you might've heard that 

131
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:17,630
rebranded as grit in a very corrupt act 
by the way,

132
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,880
um,
because it's a good predictor of 

133
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,780
longterm life success,
freedom from negative emotion.

134
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,980
Low neuroticism is another predictor,
but it's sort of third on the hierarchy.

135
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,100
And then openness to experience which is
a personality trait,

136
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:34,160
is associated with,
with expertise in creative domains.

137
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,190
The evidence that now I should tell you.

138
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,370
So it's such a complicated question.
I should tell you how to make an Iq 

139
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,581
test.
It's actually really easy and you need 

140
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:45,620
to know this to actually understand what
Iq is.

141
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:50,060
So imagine that you generated a,
a set of 10,000

142
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:54,170
questions about anything.
It could be math problems,

143
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:56,360
they could be general knowledge,
they could be vocabulary,

144
00:07:56,361 --> 00:08:01,361
that could be multiple choice.
It really doesn't matter what they're 

145
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:01,370
about as long as they require 
abstraction to solve,

146
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,780
so they'd be formulated linguistically,
but mathematically would also apply.

147
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,900
And then you have those 10,000
questions.

148
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,960
Now you take a random set of 100 of 
those questions and you give them to a 

149
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,300
thousand people and all you do is sum up
the answers right from so some people 

150
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,231
are going to get most of them right and 
some of some of them are going to get 

151
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:23,231
most of them wrong.

152
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:23,870
You just rank order the people in terms 
of their score,

153
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,790
correct that for age and you have Iq.
That's all there is to it.

154
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,180
And what you'll find is that no matter 
which random set of 100 questions you 

155
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,111
take,
the people at the top of one random set 

156
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:39,230
will be at the top of all the others and
it with very,

157
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:41,000
very,
very high consistency.

158
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:46,210
So one thing you need to know is that if
any social science claims whatsoever are

159
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:51,581
correct,
then the ICU claims are correct because 

160
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:57,101
the ICU claims are more psychometrically
rigorous than any other phenomena 

161
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:59,430
phenomena that's been discovered by 
social scientists.

162
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Now,
the ICU literature is a dismal 

163
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:04,880
literature.
No one likes it.

164
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,220
Here's why.
Here's an example.

165
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,490
So here's a little,
here's a fun little fact for you,

166
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,730
for Liberals and conservatives alike,
because conservatives think there's a 

167
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:13,730
job for everyone.

168
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,420
If people just get off their asses and 
get the work and liberals think while 

169
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,850
you can train anyone to do anything,
it's like,

170
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,060
no,
there isn't a job for everyone and no,

171
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,240
you can't train everyone to do 
everything that's wrong.

172
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,670
And here's one of the consequences of 
that.

173
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,210
So as I mentioned,
the Armed Forces has done a lot of work 

174
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:32,330
on ICU when they started back in 19,
19.

175
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,560
And the reason they did that was 
because,

176
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,280
well,
for obvious reasons,

177
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:41,281
say let's say there's a war and you want
to get qualified people into the officer

178
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:44,190
positions as rapidly as possible or 
you'll lose.

179
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,860
So that's a reason.
Now,

180
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:50,790
the armed forces has experimented with 
Iq tests since 19,

181
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:55,791
19,
and in the last 20 years I'm a law was 

182
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,150
passed as a consequence of that 
analysis,

183
00:09:57,151 --> 00:10:02,151
which was that it was illegal to induct 
anyone into the armed forces who had an 

184
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:02,550
Iq of less than 83.

185
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,840
Now the question is why and the answer 
was all of that effort put in by the 

186
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:11,970
armed forces indicated that if you had 
an Iq of 83 or less,

187
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:16,971
there wasn't anything that you could be 
trained to do in the military that 

188
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:18,630
wasn't positively counterproductive.
Now you got to think about that a,

189
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:23,230
because the military is chronically 
desperate for people right there.

190
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:26,640
It's not like they're so like people are
lining up to be inducted,

191
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,890
right?
They have to go out and recruit and it's

192
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:33,891
not easy and so they're desperate to get
their hands on every body they can 

193
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:36,030
possibly manage and then especially in 
war time,

194
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:38,580
but also in peacetime.
But then there was another reason too,

195
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:43,581
which was the armed forces,
was also set up from a policy 

196
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:44,640
perspective to take people in the 
underclass,

197
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:47,610
let's say,
and train them and move them up at least

198
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,350
into the working class or maybe the 
middle class.

199
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:52,890
So there's a policy element to it too.
And so even from that perspective,

200
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:56,040
you could see that the military is 
desperate to bring people in,

201
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,850
but it well with an Iq of 83 or less,
it's not happening.

202
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,900
Okay?
So how many people have an Iq of 83 or 

203
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:05,900
less?

204
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,640
Ten percent.
Now,

205
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,570
if that doesn't,

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,110
if that doesn't hurt you to hear,
then you didn't hear it properly.

207
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,450
Because what it implies is that in a 
complex society like ours and one that's

208
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:26,451
becoming increasingly complex,
there isn't anything for 10 percent of 

209
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,770
the population to do.
Alright,

210
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,660
well what are we going to do?
We're going to ignore that.

211
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,570
We're going to run away from that and 
believe me,

212
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:38,571
we have every reason to.
Or we're going to contend with the fact 

213
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:39,930
that we need to figure out how it is,
how it is,

214
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,020
how it might be possible to find a place
for people on the lower end of the 

215
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:50,931
general cognitive distribution to take 
their productive and worthwhile place in

216
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:53,740
society.
And that isn't just going to a matter of

217
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:58,741
dumping money down the hierarchy because
giving people who have nothing to do 

218
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:01,000
money isn't helpful.
It doesn't work.

219
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,910
It's not that simple.
Well,

220
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,600
so that's kind of an answer to the 
question of whether or not we should 

221
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:09,600
deal with,
uh,

222
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,330
with Iq forthrightly.
It's like,

223
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,720
if you can find a flaw in that logic,
like just go right ahead.

224
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:18,030
It's not like I was thrilled to death to
discover all of this by nose,

225
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,630
by no stretch of the imagination.
Was that the case?

226
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,750
So,
so what?

227
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:27,890
So Iq is reliable and valid.
That's the first thing.

228
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,090
It's more reliable and valid than any 
other psychometric test ever designed by

229
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:35,540
social scientists by a factor of about 
three.

230
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:41,350
That's fact number one.
Fact number two is it predicts longterm 

231
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,880
life outcome at about point three,
point four,

232
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:49,090
which leaves about 85 percent,
70 to 85 percent of the story 

233
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,661
unexplained,
but it's still the best thing that we 

234
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:52,661
have.
Well,

235
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:54,530
it's also the case that in places like 
Great Britain,

236
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,310
when Iq tests were first introduced,
they were actually used by the 

237
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,641
socialists and they were used to 
identify poor people who had potential 

238
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,880
cognitive potential and to move them 
into higher Ed Institutes of higher 

239
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,850
education.
So there's an upside,

240
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,890
you know,
social upside as well.

241
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,530
Ethnic differences.

242
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:23,010
This is something you can't say anything
about without without immediately being 

243
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,230
killed.
So I'm hesitant to broach the topic,

244
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:31,530
but I'll tell you one thing that I did 
in the last week that's relevant to 

245
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:31,530
this.
So the,

246
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,000
and this just shows you how complex the 
problem is.

247
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,120
First of all,
we should point out that race is a very 

248
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,250
difficult thing to define because racial
boundaries aren't tight,

249
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,480
right?
So,

250
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,480
and so when you talk about racial 
differences in Iq,

251
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:48,481
you,
you're faced with a thorny problem of 

252
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:50,551
defining race.
And that's a big problem from a 

253
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:52,771
scientific perspective,
but we'll leave that aside and I wrote 

254
00:13:52,771 --> 00:13:56,500
an article this week.
Somebody stood up at one point,

255
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,400
one of my talks and vice bless their 
hearts,

256
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,820
took this particular question and used 
it as an indication of the quality of 

257
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,360
the people who are my so called 
followers.

258
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:10,090
And by the way,
the quality of my so called followers is

259
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:11,140
pretty damn high.

260
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:16,410
And you can find that out quite rapidly 
just by going looking at the youtube 

261
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,281
comments which are head and shoulders 
above what the standard set of youtube 

262
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:20,740
comments.
I can tell you that.

263
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,090
So someone asked me that both the Jewish
question,

264
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,560
right?
And the,

265
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,650
the implication it was actually someone 
Jewish and the implication was that Jews

266
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:36,480
are overrepresented in positions of 
authority and power and,

267
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,100
and I was,
had just spoken for like an hour and a 

268
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,211
half and you know,
this guy had an ax to grind and I 

269
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:45,790
thought there is no God damn way I'm 
getting into this at the moment.

270
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,740
And so I,
I said I'm.

271
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,630
I said,
I can't answer that question,

272
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:55,080
but that's not a very good answer.
So I wrote a blog post this week and I 

273
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,080
said,
look,

274
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,610
here's the.
Here's the situation.

275
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,630
All right,
Jews are overrepresented in positions of

276
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,660
power and authority,
but then let's open our eyes a little 

277
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:04,660
bit.

278
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,110
Hey,
thank for like two or three seconds and 

279
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,110
think,
hey,

280
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,021
guess what?
They're also overrepresented in 

281
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:12,380
positions of competence and it's not 
like we have more geniuses.

282
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:17,381
Then we know what to do with and if the 
Jews happened to be producing more of 

283
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:17,381
them,
which they are,

284
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:22,181
by the way,
then that's a pretty good thing for the 

285
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:24,731
rest of us.
So let's not confuse competence with 

286
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:27,611
power and authority,
even though that's a favorite trick of 

287
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:28,010
the radical leftists who always failed 
to make that distinction.

288
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,090
Well,
why does this over representation occur?

289
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:37,330
Because it does it also.
There's also overrepresentation in 

290
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,650
political movements including radical 
political movements.

291
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,730
Okay,
why?

292
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,820
Well,
answer one Jewish conspiracy.

293
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,190
Okay.
That's not a very good answer.

294
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,830
We've had.
We've used that answer before.

295
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:49,960
Alright,
but,

296
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,070
but do we have an alternative?
Well,

297
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:57,071
here's an alternative.
The average Ashkenazi Iq is somewhere 

298
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:58,430
between 1:10
and 1:15,

299
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,570
which is about one standard deviation 
above the population average.

300
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,720
And so what that means is that the 
average Ashkenazi Slash European Jew has

301
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:13,211
an Iq that's higher than 85 percent of 
the population that's a lot higher now,

302
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,560
that doesn't make that much difference 
in the middle of the distribution.

303
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:23,650
Okay?
But geniuses don't exist at the middle 

304
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,261
of the distribution.
They exist at the tails of the 

305
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:28,991
distribution and you don't need much of 
a move at the mean to produce walloping 

306
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:34,661
differences at the tails.
And the tails are important because a 

307
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,051
lot of where we draw,
we draw exceptional people from the 

308
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:38,990
exceptions.
Right?

309
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:43,991
So here's an example.
Here's another example of the same 

310
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:44,390
thing.
Most engineers are male.

311
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,380
Why?
Because men are more interested in 

312
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,890
things and women are more interested in 
people and you might say,

313
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:53,200
well,
that's socio-cultural.

314
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,350
It's like,
no,

315
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:58,220
it's not.
And we know that because if you stack up

316
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:02,180
countries by their,
by their egalitarian social policies,

317
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,070
which you can do quite effectively.

318
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,220
And then you look at the 
overrepresentation of men in stem 

319
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,031
fields,
the overrepresentation increases as the 

320
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:16,640
countries become more egalitarian.
So it's not socio-cultural.

321
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,660
Okay,
now men aren't that much more interested

322
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:23,150
in things than women.
It's one standard deviation,

323
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:25,040
which is about the same difference by 
the way,

324
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,590
between the population norm in the 
Ashkenazi Jews.

325
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,860
But if you're looking at the person who 
the one person in 20 or the one person 

326
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,121
in 50 who's most who's hyper interested 
in things and that's likely to become an

327
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,490
engineer,
then most of them are men.

328
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,980
Here's another example of the same 
thing.

329
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Men are more aggressive than women.
Now you might ask how much and the 

330
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:52,650
answer to that is best place to look at 
that as in Sweden,

331
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,680
where the egalitarian policies of be 
laid out for a long period of time and 

332
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,461
you can.
You can get a more direct inference 

333
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:01,461
about biology.

334
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:05,120
If you took a random man and a random 
woman out of the population and you had 

335
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,681
to bet on who was more aggressive and 
you bet on the man you'd be right 60 

336
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:10,890
percent of the time.
So that's not that much,

337
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:11,350
right?
It's,

338
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:14,760
it's deviates from 50 slash 50,
but it's not like 90 slash 10.

339
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,650
It's 60 40.
Okay.

340
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,290
So,
so what does that mean?

341
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,690
Well,
we got a tail problem here.

342
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:26,691
Again,
let's say that now you decide to go out 

343
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:28,941
onto the extremes of aggression and you 
identify the most aggressive one in 100 

344
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:31,800
persons.
They're all men.

345
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,000
Guess who's in prison?
Those people.

346
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,300
That's why most of the people in prison 
are men.

347
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,960
And so this is elementary part of the 
problem in our society is that we don't 

348
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,191
understand statistics.
We don't understand that you can have 

349
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:52,551
relatively small differences at the 
population level that produce walloping 

350
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:55,230
consequences at the tails of the 
distribution.

351
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,600
Okay.
So back to ICU.

352
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,840
One final thing to say about Iq.

353
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,380
The ethnic differences are difficult to 
dispense with.

354
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,190
It's not easy to make them go away.
You can say,

355
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,970
well the tests aren't culture fair.
Well here's the test of that.

356
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:18,420
So imagine you,
you test group a with an Iq test and the

357
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:23,421
test group B with an Iq test and then 
you look at their actual performance in 

358
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:28,491
whatever you're predicting.
If the test was biased against ethnic 

359
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:32,421
group A,
then it would under predict their 

360
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,110
performance and that doesn't happen.
Now you could say,

361
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:36,180
well,
there's systemic bias in the performance

362
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:40,050
measures and the potential measures and 
that's a possibility.

363
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,220
All right.
Now one other thing about that.

364
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,870
There's a real danger in the ethnicity 
Iq debate and the danger is that we 

365
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,660
confuse intelligence with value or that 
we include we we confuse intelligence 

366
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:01,860
with yet with human value.
That's a better way of thinking about it

367
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,220
and one of the things that we're going 
to have to understand here is that 

368
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,361
that's a mistake,
is that being more intelligent doesn't 

369
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:11,361
make you a better person.

370
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,460
That's not the case.
It makes you more useful for complex 

371
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,960
cognitive operations,
but you can be pretty damn horrific as a

372
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:21,240
genius son of a bitch,
right?

373
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:26,241
It's morally neutral,
and we also know that from the 

374
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:26,241
psychometric data.
By the way,

375
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:29,871
there doesn't seem to be any 
relationship whatsoever between 

376
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:32,121
intelligence and virtue,
and so if it does turn out that nature 

377
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:35,820
and the fates do not align with our 
egalitarianism presuppositions,

378
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:40,821
which is highly probable.
We shouldn't therefore make the mistake 

379
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:43,881
of assuming that if group A or person a 
is lower on one of these attributes than

380
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:48,210
group B or person b,
that that is somehow reflective of their

381
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:51,390
intrinsic value as human beings.
That's a big mistake.
