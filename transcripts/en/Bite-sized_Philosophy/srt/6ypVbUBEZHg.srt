1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,600
So these creatures engaging in dominance
disputes and,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,650
and I think dominance is the right way 
to think about it because lobsters 

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:09,650
aren't very empathic and they're not 
very social.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,030
And so it really is the toughest lobster
that wins,

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,330
you know,
and what's so cool about the lobster is 

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,900
that when a lobster wins,
he flexes and gets bigger.

7
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,250
So he looks bigger because he's a 
winner.

8
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:24,150
It's like he's advertising that and the 
biological,

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,290
the neurochemical system that makes him 
flex his serotonergic and you think,

10
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:28,950
well,
who cares?

11
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:30,240
What the hell does that mean?
Well,

12
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:35,241
tell you what it means.
It's the same chemical that's affected 

13
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:35,340
by antidepressants in human beings.
And so like,

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,560
if you're depressed,
you're defeated lobster.

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,630
Like you're like this.
I'm small,

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,380
I'm not,
you know,

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,540
things are dangerous.
I don't want to fight.

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,720
You give somebody an anti depressants 
like cup they stretch and then they're 

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,120
ready to like take on the world again.

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,450
Well,
if you give lobsters who just got 

21
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:53,450
defeated in a fight,
Serotonin,

22
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,180
then they stretch out and they'll fight 
again.

23
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,590
And that's like we separated from those 
creatures on the evolutionary timescale.

24
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,850
Somewhere between 350 and 600 million 
years ago and the damn neurochemistry is

25
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:06,210
the same,
and so that's another indication of just

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,660
how important hierarchies of authority 
are.

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,390
I mean,
they've been conserved since the time of

28
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:13,350
lobsters,
right?

29
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,090
There were trees around when lobsters 
first first manifested themselves on the

30
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:23,091
planet.
And so what that means is these 

31
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:23,091
hierarchies that I've been talking 
about,

32
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:27,170
those things are older than trees.
And so one of the truisms for what 

33
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:32,370
constitutes real from a Darwinian 
perspective is that,

34
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:35,130
which has been around the longest period
of time,

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,220
right?
Because it's had the longest period of 

36
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,220
time to exert selection pressure.
Well,

37
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,780
we know we evolved and lived in trees,
something on the order of 60 million 

38
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:44,780
years ago.

39
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,630
We're talking 10 times as far back as 
that for the hierarchy.

40
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,930
And so the idea that human beings that 
the hierarchy is something that has 

41
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,711
exerted selection pressure on human 
beings is I don't think that's a 

42
00:01:57,711 --> 00:01:59,550
disputable.
That's not a disputable issue.

43
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,960
How it's done at an exactly what that 
means we can argue about,

44
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,970
but like that sort of biological 
continuity is just absolutely 

45
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:07,970
unbelievable.
I,

46
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,970
um,
it was funny because I revealed this 

47
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:12,970
finding,
you know,

48
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,560
I didn't discover this,
I read about it,

49
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,440
but I talked to my graduate students 
about,

50
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,070
I used to take them out for breakfast,
you know,

51
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:20,640
and they were very contentious,
snappy bunch and uh,

52
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,060
and they're always trying to one up each
other and they were quite witty and for 

53
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,160
like six months until it got very 
annoying.

54
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,810
Every time one of them went up the 
other,

55
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:30,040
they'd stretch themselves out,
like snap their hands.

56
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,850
Like.
So that was,

57
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,230
that was very funny.
It was,

58
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,260
it was really very funny.
So you see this in lobsters and so 

59
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,260
that's pretty amazing.
So,

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,640
you know,
and one of the other thing that's really

61
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:43,940
cool about lobsters is that,
um,

62
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,320
let's say you've been like top lobster 
for a long time,

63
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:49,550
but you're getting kind of old and some 
young lobster just,

64
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,330
you know,
whales the hell out of you.

65
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,110
And so you're all depressed,
but thing is your brain is dominant,

66
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,870
but you don't have much of a brain 
because you're a lobster.

67
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:00,310
And so now what are you going to do?
Because you just lost.

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,480
And the answer is while your brain will 
dissolve and then you'll grow a 

69
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,370
subordinate brain.
Yeah.

70
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:08,530
And so that's where thinking about too,
right here,

71
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,970
for a couple of reasons.
First of all,

72
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,050
if any of you who've ever been seriously
defeated in life,

73
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,610
you know what that's like.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,050
It's like it's a death,
a dissenter,

75
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,380
a dissolution,
and if you're lucky,

76
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,380
a regrowth and,
and maybe not as the same person,

77
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:25,780
that's what happens to people with 
posttraumatic stress disorder,

78
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:30,781
right?
Their brains undergo permanent 

79
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:32,611
neurological transformation and,
and they then inhabit a world that's 

80
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:34,060
much more dangerous than the world that 
they inhabited to begin with.

81
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:39,061
But we also know too,
if you have posttraumatic stress 

82
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:39,700
disorder or depression,
that your hippocampus shrinks,

83
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,530
right?
He dies and shrinks,

84
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,570
and you can sometimes get it to grow 
back.

85
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:48,571
Your hippocampus shrinks and your 
Amygdala and the Amygdala increases 

86
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:52,711
emotional sensitivity.
And the hippocampus inhibits emotional 

87
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:52,990
sensitivity.
And so if you've been badly defeated,

88
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:55,060
the hippocampus shrinks and the amygdala
grows.

89
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,110
Now if you recover,
the hippocampus will regrow.

90
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,360
And antidepressants actually seem to 
help that.

91
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:03,220
But the damn Amygdala never shrinks 
again.

92
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,030
And so well.
So that's another lesson from the 

93
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,030
lobster.
It's quite a terrifying one,

94
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,190
but,
but it's one like,

95
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,490
it's so interesting that you can relate 
to that.

96
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:13,090
Right.
I was like,

97
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:15,070
I get what that poor crustaceans going 
through,

98
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:15,730
you know.
