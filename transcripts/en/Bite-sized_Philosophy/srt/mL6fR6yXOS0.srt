1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,720
At the end of 1929,
the Kremlin decreed that millions of 

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,901
peasants from individually owned farms 
will be forced into agricultural 

3
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:12,410
collectives or cold causes seen in the 
eyes of the bureau as pliant providers 

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,320
of Soviet agricultural needs in defiance
of the facts,

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,590
so they,
the the ologists hammered out 

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,361
inappropriate Marxist terminology to 
explain what was going on throughout 

7
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:26,950
grain producing areas.
It was said resistance to this 

8
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:32,001
scientific scheme was being organized by
so called rich peasants are kulaks with 

9
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:37,221
his customer brutality.
Therefore stellan decreed the 

10
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:40,071
liquidation of the cool acts as a class.
We'll stand in like this idea of like 

11
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:44,031
group guilt.
That was a major theme for Stella and 

12
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:45,240
that meant I really didn't have to ever 
pay attention to you as an individual.

13
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:47,190
I could just decide if you were a 
doctor,

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,270
engineer or a Kulak or a German or 
whatever.

15
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:56,271
Ethnic,
racial or educational division happened 

16
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:56,330
to characterize my particular target at 
the time,

17
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:59,460
and it didn't matter if you were guilty 
as an individual.

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,180
That whole notion never even obtained.
It was class guilted mattered and if you

19
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:05,640
were in one of those classes,
well we're better without you.

20
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:08,520
And of course the nature of the class 
just changed constantly.

21
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:12,120
But it was perfectly logical thing to 
think if you believed in like historical

22
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:15,120
determinism,
if your parents were rich birch wha,

23
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:20,121
what was the probability that you are 
going to be a useful part of the 

24
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,541
workers' collective bs?
You're just to get rid of you ahead of 

25
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:23,541
time so you didn't cause too much 
trouble.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,580
So then you think about these cool acts,
rich peasants,

27
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,910
who are these people like when we get 
down to the individual level,

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,680
so you go on a village village was full 
of surfs like not 40 years before.

29
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:38,850
So these are people just struggling out 
of the feudal society.

30
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:43,851
Right?
And you've got some people in there 

31
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:43,851
who've managed to be successful enough 
as farmers,

32
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:48,321
which is no easy thing to like have a 
house and maybe hire one person and you 

33
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:52,551
know,
maybe have a little extra food in the 

34
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:53,290
larger and a few kind of material 
possession.

35
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,920
So these are successful people and so 
you could say,

36
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:59,520
well they're the ones that actually knew
how to farm to one theory or you can say

37
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:04,521
the reason they had all this stuff was 
because they stoled it from all the 

38
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:04,521
other people.
Right?

39
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:04,521
And then you think,
okay,

40
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:07,140
so I marched into town,
I'm a Soviet revolutionary,

41
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:08,910
and I say,
hey guys,

42
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,600
you know those rich people,
they stole everything they have from you

43
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,950
and then you think,
okay,

44
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,990
which are you guys is going to listen to
that.

45
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Well,
it's not going to be the sort of 

46
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:21,500
struggling people just underneath them 
who are really trying to get ahead,

47
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,091
right?
Because that's where they're hoping to 

48
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:26,091
get.
It's going to be.

49
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:26,700
They're resentful and revengeful few who
think,

50
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,880
well,
the world is fundamentally unfair and 

51
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,861
it's obvious that those sons of bitches 
got what they want by stealing it from 

52
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:33,861
me.

53
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:36,210
And here it turns out that if I just go 
down the street and steal it back,

54
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,810
well not only,
not only am I allowed to do that,

55
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:42,210
but according to this new and emergent 
etiology,

56
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,300
man,
that's the best thing I could possibly 

57
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,151
do.
So then multiply that story by several 

58
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:53,420
million participants and you have like 
the first five years of the Soviet 

59
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,150
Empire,
and so what do we have there?

60
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,480
The result was a catastrophic onslaught 
on millions of peasant households at 

61
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,711
first,
activists and local officials read 

62
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:03,711
bullies,
right,

63
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:08,640
brutalized peasants,
forcing them to surrender their 

64
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:08,640
homesteads and their possessions,
deportations,

65
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,690
arrests,
and killing soon followed as terror.

66
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:15,691
Generalized the violence mounted to full
scale rebellion in various places with 

67
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:18,820
regular troops engaged for months.
For example,

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,830
suppressing peasant uprisings resistance
took various forms,

69
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:27,460
usually reflecting the hopeless,
desperate anguish of a doomed population

70
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,040
in the Ukraine.
There were even women's rebellions,

71
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,190
spontaneous uprisings of peasant women 
who attacked the local Coco's is to 

72
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,630
demand a return of confiscated foreign 
products with a colossal impact on the 

73
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,200
Soviet economy.

74
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,510
Peasants slaughtered their animals by 
the millions rather than see them seized

75
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,840
for two years.
The fighting raged as the dreadful 

76
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,610
process of deep Kula Ization continued 
style in order to further assault on the

77
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:59,611
recalcitrant peasantry.
What conquest caused the terror famine 

78
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:03,241
of 1932 Moscow rights conquest.
It's from a book called the harvest of 

79
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:09,421
sorrow.
Knowingly decreed green procurement 

80
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:13,070
procurement's from the Ukraine.
Analysis were exceeding by far with the 

81
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,201
local population could produce right,
which meant that everyone who lived 

82
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,640
there was forest in order to deliver 
more grain than they had ever grown.

83
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,040
Communist brigades roam the countryside,
forcing agriculturalists to disgorge the

84
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,460
little they had been able to produce 
under conditions of severe dislocation.

85
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,110
Grain sat unused in state reserves while
the local population starved.
