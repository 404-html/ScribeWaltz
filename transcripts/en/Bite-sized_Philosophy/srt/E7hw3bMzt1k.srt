1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,900
Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and 
Gomorrah,

2
00:00:02,901 --> 00:00:05,030
brimstone and fire from the Lord out of 
Heaven,

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,840
and he overthrew the cities and all the 
plane and all the inhabitants of the 

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:10,850
cities and that which grew up on the 
ground,

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,490
but his wife looked back from behind him
and she became a pillar of salt,

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,490
known histology for catastrophe.
I think that's what that means is that 

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,650
when you leave what's not good,
you wash the dust off your feet and you 

8
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:36,580
don't look back,
and that's a very harsh lesson.

9
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,370
This is echoed a bit,
the New Testament,

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,570
the idea of the necessity for immediate 
action.

11
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:49,540
These are some of the harsher words that
Christ said.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,840
This is from Matthew Eight.
Christ is addressing a multitude and 

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,950
asking people to follow him,
and a disciple comes up to him and says,

14
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:04,951
Lord,
suffer me first to go and bury my 

15
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:07,591
father.
Seems like a perfectly reasonable 

16
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:07,591
request,
but Jesus said unto him,

17
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:10,450
follow me,
and let the dead bury their dead.

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,220
This is from Matthew 12.
Well,

19
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:18,430
he had talked to the people.
Behold his mother and his brethren stood

20
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:21,220
without desiring to speak with him.
Then one said to him,

21
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,170
behold,
thy mother and I,

22
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:28,171
brethren,
stand without desiring to speak with 

23
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,361
the,
but Jesus answered the one who was 

24
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:30,880
telling him and said,
who is my mother and who is my brother's

25
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,880
for whosoever shall do the will of my 
father,

26
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:40,881
which is in heaven,
the same as my brother and sister and 

27
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:40,990
mother.
Well,

28
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:45,991
what does all that mean?
It means that there's no excuses 

29
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:49,910
whatsoever for not getting up and 
getting out it.

30
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,540
That's what it means and it means that

31
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,880
it even means that when people are beset
with a catastrophe,

32
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:01,710
like let's say the death of their 
father,

33
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,960
that they are prone to use that as an 
excuse for not going about the business 

34
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,140
that they should be going about because 
they can say to themselves,

35
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:12,480
well,
I would except,

36
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,330
and except there's always good reasons.
I mean,

37
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:20,331
believe me,
there's always good reasons for not 

38
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:22,011
doing what you should.
It's for sure the reasons pile up day 

39
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:23,360
after day to not do what you should,
especially cause you're,

40
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,530
you're aiming at things in the future.
You can put them off and definitely 

41
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,230
right because of the demands of the day,
but these stories,

42
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,450
they say a variety of things,
you know,

43
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:38,451
and especially in combination.
They say when you leave somewhere 

44
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:38,451
terrible,
do not look back.

45
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,580
There's known astrologer that's,
that's the letting the dead parts of 

46
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,210
yourself go

47
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,770
and then if you're going to follow the 
good,

48
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:53,771
there's no excuse not to do it and that 
it means no excuse whatsoever under any 

49
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:55,700
circumstances.
And then it's taken even farther.

50
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:57,770
With regards to familial relationships,
it is.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,400
You can't even let them stand in your 
way and I think that's all true and I 

52
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:06,850
think I've seen virtually all of that in
my clinical practice.

53
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,420
Like there is no excuse whatsoever for 
not getting at what it is that you 

54
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:18,070
should be doing and I think there's 
something else that's going on here,

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,520
especially in the new testament stories 
which has even made maybe worse,

56
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:26,521
which is it's absolutely reprehensible 
to justify your inaction with a 

57
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:30,070
catastrophe that extract mercy from 
other people.

58
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,660
Right?
There's a tricky,

59
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,240
tricky game that's going well,
of course I can't do that.

60
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:36,640
Look at the terrible thing that's just 
happened to me and say,

61
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:37,180
oh,
okay,

62
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,300
I understand you're absolved of any 
necessity to move forward because of 

63
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,960
your current catastrophe.
It's like,

64
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:45,580
well,
actually you're not,

65
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,910
and it's rather rude of you to use it as
an excuse and it's certainly 

66
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:50,910
counterproductive.
