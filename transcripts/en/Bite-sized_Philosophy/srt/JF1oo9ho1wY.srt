1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,050
So Dr Peterson,
you talking about this idea of ending 

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,420
unnecessary suffering and this idea of 
committing one's life to that at a 

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,220
minimum,
I mean that's the minimum thing that you

4
00:00:10,221 --> 00:00:12,350
could do.
A lot of students,

5
00:00:12,351 --> 00:00:17,351
I think accept that premise and view 
what they're doing as trying to 

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:21,200
eliminate or reduce unnecessary 
suffering and they see activism or other

7
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:23,900
forms of direct service as fulfilling 
that goal.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,080
Do you simply disagree with like the 
content of what they think the tactic 

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,040
that they are using to end unnecessary 
suffering?

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,220
Or do you think that their motives or 
their intentions are not even the same 

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:36,220
as yours

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,660
to public?
You know,

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,190
there's,
there's this old saying from the,

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,160
from the new testament about not praying
in public.

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,950
Right?
And the idea is that if you're going to 

16
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,221
commune for the higher good,
you should do it in private because 

17
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:58,820
otherwise you're warping your ethic in 
some sense by demonstrating how virtuous

18
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:01,020
you virtuous you are to the world.
It's like,

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,470
you know,
you go out there with a stick and a sign

20
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:05,330
on it that says I'm against poverty.
It's like,

21
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,310
yeah,
no kidding.

22
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,340
That's really like for poverty,
poverty,

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,190
so it's,
it's,

24
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,260
it's,
it's an abdication of responsibility 

25
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,210
with the mask of social virtue and you 
want to solve difficult problems.

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,810
You've figured out how to get along with
your brother,

27
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:22,460
the one you've been fighting with for 
five years,

28
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:24,890
or see if you can staple your family 
back together,

29
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,950
see if you can stop fighting with your 
girlfriend and have a relationship that 

30
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:29,950
lasts for more than two weeks.

31
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,810
You know,
it's like there are things that you 

32
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,090
should be doing in the confines of your 
own life that are private and humble,

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,950
that would,
would,

34
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,960
that would constitute genuine 
accomplishments and those are the things

35
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:41,150
that you should attend to.
And no one's gonna come along and say,

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,020
hey,
you know,

37
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,970
good job,
you're,

38
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,950
you're changing the world because it's 
private,

39
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,100
but it's real and people don't do that.
And so no,

40
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:50,690
I don't.
I don't trust the activist.

41
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,660
I don't trust the activist ethos at all.
I think.

42
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,770
I think everything about it is,
is superficial and,

43
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,130
and trendy and,
and too easy.

44
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,460
And and at the externalizes the blame,
the evil is always elsewhere,

45
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:13,820
which is a dreadful mistake to make 
because the evil isn't elsewhere.

46
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:18,821
That's,
that's the thing that you understand 

47
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:18,860
when you're wise is the evil is not 
elsewhere,

48
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,160
it's you because you're not everything 
you could be.

49
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,650
And so you know,
you should work on that before going in 

50
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:27,650
and telling someone else that maybe 
they're not who they should be.

51
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,960
So I think it's,
you know,

52
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,940
so I don't buy it.
It's too easy.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,440
It's far too easy and it's too public 
and it's too self congratulatory.

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,750
And then there's the murderous like 
Marxist element,

55
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:41,330
which I'm always often inclined to 
mention.

56
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,670
So certainly I think you've identified 
certain causes where the public element 

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,710
or the self congratulatory time to do 
good.

58
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,530
Could it be harmful?
But do you think there are cases,

59
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:59,531
for instance,
I'm thinking of policy influencing 

60
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:01,871
policy and being a policymaker.
It seems something like that public 

61
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:05,581
policy could be used to eliminate some 
unnecessary suffering but would involve 

62
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:12,121
a more public domain.
Something where you are trying to 

63
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:14,851
attract followers,
trying to attract praise from other 

64
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:14,851
people.
Look,

65
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:19,270
if you,
if you've established yourself in the 

66
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,571
world as a credible human being and 
people are asking you to enter public 

67
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:26,540
service because of your accomplishments,
then it's time to do it right,

68
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,250
but before that it's a little on the 
premature side and if you're just 

69
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,260
setting your for self forward as an 
Avatar of an idea of an ideology,

70
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,310
then there's nothing to you except I 
think of it as the chattering of various

71
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,510
forms of demons.

72
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,780
It's like you're not helpful and if you.
If you look,

73
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:44,530
you want to think,
okay,

74
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:46,330
are you fit to lead?
Let's,

75
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:47,650
let's put it that way.
Okay.

76
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,840
First of all,
do you know where you're going?

77
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,990
Because that's actually one of the 
hallmarks of a leader.

78
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:57,010
Leader knows where he's going and maybe 
other people are also interested in 

79
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,421
going that way,
but the leaders I've met have carved 

80
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:00,421
themselves out a personal vision,
right?

81
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:05,371
It's not some,
it's not some cookie cutter ideological 

82
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,510
solution to the ills of the planet.
They've done a detailed analysis,

83
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:09,430
right?
They know what they're talking about and

84
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:10,710
they're usually people.
Well,

85
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,720
they've had a successful relationship,
they've had a successful family,

86
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,900
they have a couple of degrees,
they've established a business like 

87
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,900
they've made themselves credible in five
or six dimensions.

88
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:25,110
Well then maybe you know enough about 
the world to dare to mess with its 

89
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,651
internal mechanisms and if you,
if you don't have that kind of in depth 

90
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:28,651
knowledge,
then you should.

91
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:33,630
You shouldn't.
You should know more work on the 

92
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:33,630
economic systems of Western 
civilization.

93
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,670
Then you should try to adjust the 
electronic systems of your automobile 

94
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,370
because the latter is far less complex 
than the former.

95
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,760
So of course there's utility in policy 
formulation and in,

96
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,220
in government service,
and then all of those sorts of things.

97
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,910
But you have to.
You have to have transformed yourself at

98
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:56,911
least to some degree,
into someone who's actually competent 

99
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:56,911
before you should even dare to do such 
things.

100
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:57,490
You think,
well,

101
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,470
I have read some marks and now I know 
how to change the world.

102
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,680
That that's a very bad idea because the 
probability that you're going to take 

103
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,901
something complex that doesn't work too 
badly and fix it with your idiotic 

104
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:12,660
intervention is zero.

105
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,550
Hmm.
Well put.
