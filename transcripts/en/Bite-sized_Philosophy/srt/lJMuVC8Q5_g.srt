1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,410
People aren't taught that comparing what
we have to.

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:07,680
They're hypothetical politically,
politically,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,370
ideologically motivated.
Utopia is actually a bad idea,

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,540
you know,
because it's,

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,430
it just isn't difficult to take a look 
at a system like our system and say,

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,760
well,
look at all the problems that has 

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,130
compared to a hypothetical system that 
doesn't have any problems at all.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,910
And it's like,
well,

9
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,360
yeah man,
there's problems,

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,220
there's,
you know,

11
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:31,221
we've,
we've taken like 99 percent of the fish 

12
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:31,880
out of the ocean and,
and you know,

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,890
the degree to which our current level of
economic activity is truly sustainable 

14
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,250
without alteration is at least 
debatable.

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,820
Even though I don't think it's nearly as
terrible as people make out,

16
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:46,821
make it out to be.
But I don't think it's disputable that 

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,950
our current socioeconomic structures are
the most productive and the most free 

18
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:55,680
structures that have ever been produced 
by people anywhere in the world.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,680
And one of the things you can say about 
capitalism and free enterprise and and 

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,500
the western stress on individuality is 
that even though it does produce 

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,921
inequality,
a all systems producing inequality and 

22
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:14,061
and without any real distinction between
the right and the left by the wayside 

23
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:17,971
because I'm so new book called the Great
Leveler by Walter Shadelle,

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,030
who I'm going to be talking to later 
this month,

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,300
he did an analysis,
empirical analysis trying to figure out 

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,680
if you,
if you grouped governments by right wing

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,710
philosophy say or by left wing 
philosophy and then you calculated 

28
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,700
inequality coefficient.
Would that left wing organizations be 

29
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,290
characterized by reduced inequality?
And the answer was no.

30
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,620
There's no evidence that they are.
And what that points to,

31
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:48,621
and this is something very fundamental,
it's a far more fundamental than than 

32
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:52,681
political,
is that inequality is the rule in 

33
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,260
cooperative slash competitive 
organizations.

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,950
You can't positive value without 
producing a hierarchy,

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,350
right?

36
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,440
Because you paused,
it devalues,

37
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,370
say this is worth doing.
And everyone says,

38
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:03,780
yeah,
this is worth doing well.

39
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:07,380
Then what happens automatically is that 
it turns out that some people are better

40
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:10,350
at doing it than other people,
no matter what it is,

41
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:11,550
and then they'll get better and better 
at it,

42
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:13,320
like the Credo principle you're talking 
about too,

43
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:14,760
and then they start getting better at 
it.

44
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:19,260
So the problem is is that without you 
with if you're going to positive value,

45
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:24,261
which you have to do,
if you're going to act and immediately 

46
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:25,710
you create a hierarchy and you also 
build into the value claim,

47
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,800
the claim that a is better than b.
You also built into that the idea that 

48
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,320
if a is better than B,
than people who are doing better at a 

49
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,220
should be differentially rewarded 
compared to people who who aren't.

50
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,790
There's no way around that if you're 
going to play the game and so you're 

51
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,640
stuck with inequality,
but there isn't any evidence that that 

52
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,490
social engineering policies are really 
very good at dispensing with inequality,

53
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:54,060
which is a fundamental political problem
and no one really knows what to do about

54
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:56,490
it,
but criticizing the entire society.

55
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,250
I mean,
the thing about the west,

56
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,930
and this is increasingly true all over 
the world,

57
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:06,931
is that it's generating our approach 
generates a tremendous amount of wealth 

58
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:06,931
for ever.
I mean,

59
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:08,740
it even happened in China,
you know,

60
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,130
despite their exceptionally totalitarian
leanings.

61
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,330
And so what happens with the lefties is 
that they say,

62
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:21,331
well,
inequality as a consequence of the west 

63
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:23,650
and the consequences of capitalism,
which is palpably false claim and say,

64
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,330
well,
because it produces inequality,

65
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,920
then it's a corrupt system.
It's like,

66
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:28,630
no,
every system produces inequality,

67
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:30,850
but hardly any also produce wealth.
