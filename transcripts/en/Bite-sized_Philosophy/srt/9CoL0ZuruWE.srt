1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,230
Buddha finds his enlightenment under a 
tree.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,610
It's not fluke that that's the case.
That's his natural environment and he's 

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,490
sitting in the Lotus here.
The Lotus opens up.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,350
It's this thing that springs up from the
depths and he sits there illuminated the

5
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:20,351
same way.
He's got a halo that's the sun that 

6
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:20,690
stands for higher consciousness and 
he's.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,410
He's transcended by accepting the fact 
that life is suffering.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,360
He's transcended the limitations that 
are part of mortality.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,770
You see that symbol there,
that swastika.

10
00:00:35,771 --> 00:00:37,210
You see it there.
It's reversed.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,590
The Nazis reversed it.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,470
Well,
think about that mean they weren't 

13
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,291
stupid.
If symbolism there symbols had meaning 

14
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,590
is what this was,
were represented was what this 

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,691
represents reversed.
Well,

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,540
that's a very bad idea.
This is the thing that this,

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,450
this idea is what enables people to 
transcend their suffering,

18
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:01,230
and Buddha said,
well,

19
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:03,600
don't,
don't be too attached to things,

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,360
and what does that mean?
It doesn't mean deny the world.

21
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:09,510
It might mean deny the world.
If you're too in love with the material,

22
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,930
like with material wellbeing,
let's say.

23
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,550
Then your pathway to transcendence and 
meaning might be to abandon that because

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,030
it's constraining you.
It's making you less than you could be,

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,420
but the fundamental lesson,
the more fundamental lesson that's 

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,841
underneath that is don't let what you 
are stopped you from being what you 

27
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:30,870
could be.
Right,

28
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,310
and so then the question is,
well,

29
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:35,910
what do you identify with?
Do you identify with what you are?

30
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,780
Then you're a tyrant.
Do you identify with with chaos,

31
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:47,050
because that's the opposite of order.
Say then you're nihilistic ball.

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,140
You don't identify with either of those.
You know that they're both necessary.

33
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:52,850
You know that you have to live with both
of them,

34
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:57,851
but you would.
You identify with the capacity to 

35
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:01,070
continually transcend what you are and 
then you seek out error.

36
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,860
That's what humility is.
It's like I'm an error ridden psych,

37
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,020
so I want to see.
I want to put myself in a situation 

38
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,051
where I can discover one of my errors.
Hopefully not in a way that's going to 

39
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:14,660
knock me completely out of the game,
right?

40
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:15,860
I,
I wanna.

41
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,130
I want to seek out a challenge.
I want to find out where my limits are,

42
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:24,131
I want to find out where there's not 
enough of me yet and I want to do it 

43
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:27,701
that in a way that's engaging because 
you know you can wear yourself out 

44
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:31,000
fighting dragons,
so obviously you can exhaust yourself 

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
completely and that's not helpful.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,290
You know,
one,

47
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,080
one of the things I learned,
for example,

48
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:38,081
when I was coaching,
when I was coaching lawyers who these 

49
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:41,831
were people who had very high end 
careers and so they had an infinite 

50
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:45,101
workload,
no matter how much they worked flat out 

51
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:45,101
there was always way more work that they
should do.

52
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:49,061
It's very difficult thing to learn to 
manage and so they were exhausting 

53
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:49,790
themselves and I said,
well,

54
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,380
you know,
you have to work less per day.

55
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:52,580
It's like,
well no,

56
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,590
that's not happening.
I can't do that.

57
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,010
And so what I learned over time was,
okay,

58
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,070
so this is what you have to do every 
three months.

59
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:03,370
You have to block off four days and go 
have a vacation,

60
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,400
and you have to plan that in advance.
So it's in your calendar so that your 

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,101
secretary doesn't book your time and 
then you need that because you have to 

62
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:13,360
recuperate enough so that you can work 
as hard as you're going to work.

63
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,310
And of course they were nervous about 
that and I said,

64
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,090
well look,
we can.

65
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,120
We can calibrate this.
Let's keep track of your billable hours 

66
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,511
over the next year and see if they 
increase or decrease because I bet you 

67
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:27,931
if you take more time off,
you'll actually have more billable 

68
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:31,290
hours.
You'll actually have your cake and eat 

69
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:31,290
it too.
You'll get to have a vacation and you'll

70
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,000
be more productive and that inevitably 
that was what happened.

71
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,060
And so that's a matter of calibrating 
the game properly.

72
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:42,061
Right?
You want to play a game that you can 

73
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:42,061
play today,
but also one that you can play next week

74
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:42,610
and next month.
We're not talking about,

75
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,890
you know,
your,

76
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,360
your career.
This week we're talking about you having

77
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:49,360
a career that lasts 30 years,
that doesn't kill you,

78
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:53,020
that doesn't make you hate yourself or 
the job that doesn't make you better.

79
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:54,520
That doesn't where you to a frazzle.

80
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,790
So it has to be optimized and so I think
that you can in fact decide to take on 

81
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:03,670
the load that's optimally meaningful if 
you want,

82
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,440
and then you get to have your cake and 
eat it too.

83
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,830
You're on the pathway to continual 
incremental improvement.

84
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:13,831
You only have to burn off a feather at a
time instead of having the whole bloody 

85
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:15,220
thing burst into flames.
But it's a constant.

86
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,400
It's a constant source of renewal and 
there's an idea that to be renewed you 

87
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
have to drink the water of life,
right?

88
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,270
That that's an old mythological idea.
And what's the water?

89
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,430
The water of life.
Chaos is water,

90
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,900
water,
water is chaos.

91
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,540
Water is what washes away.
Too much order.

92
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,840
And to stay continually,
let's say a refreshed by the water of 

93
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:42,241
life is to take on exactly the right 
amount of chaos to make sure that your 

94
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:46,740
garden is properly nourished and I think
meaning is actually the marker of that.

95
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,790
And,
and as I said,

96
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:53,791
you know that I'm not,
I wouldn't consider myself either naive 

97
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,970
or particularly optimistic person.
I don't think I'm either of those,

98
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,210
but this is an actually an idea.
This is one of the only ideas that I've 

99
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,870
ever found that I really believe to be 
rock solid.

100
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:06,871
I actually think that it's true and it's
very optimistic because it says you can 

101
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:09,460
use your sense of meaning to calibrate 
your progress through life,

102
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,380
but,
but there's rules.

103
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:16,381
You have to aim at the highest possible 
good that you can conceive now and 

104
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:17,200
that's subject to update because what 
the hell you know,

105
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:22,201
but you start by aiming at the star you 
can see rather than the dimmer one that 

106
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:24,550
you can't yet perceive,
and then you decide that you're going to

107
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:25,870
do that honestly.
Right?

108
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:27,610
There's that.
That's a big decision.

109
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:32,611
So the first decision,
I think in some senses that decision of 

110
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:35,971
love,
you're going to decide that being is 

111
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:37,300
worthwhile and that you're going to work
for its betterment and that's a decision

112
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:38,320
that's based on love.

113
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,060
And the second decision is based on 
truth.

114
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:43,210
Having made that decision,
you're going to play a straight game.

115
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,390
Having made those two decisions,
I think that you can allow your sense of

116
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:51,391
meaning to calibrate your pathway and 
then what's so interesting is that you 

117
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:54,940
hit a state that's as close to paradise 
as you're going to hit right away.

118
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:59,941
Because being engaged like that,
it's better to be engaged in the 

119
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:02,570
solution of a complex problem that not 
to have a problem at all.

120
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,650
And that's no different than saying it's
better for there to be being the non 

121
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,481
being because being is a problem.
And so if you want to have no problems,

122
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,610
then you have no being and and you could
say,

123
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,740
well,
being so miserable that maybe that's the

124
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:21,890
route we should take and fair enough,
but maybe you can have your cake and eat

125
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:22,280
it too.

126
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,490
You can have the damn problem.
It can be a problem we're solving and 

127
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,781
you can be so engaged in solving the 
problem that it justifies the fact that 

128
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:33,740
the problem exists and then you get.
Then you get to have.

129
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,370
You get to have the problem and the 
solution at the same time.

130
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:39,470
And maybe that's better than not having 
the problem at all.

131
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:41,720
And I believe that because one of the 
things I have seen,

132
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:46,721
and I've seen this so interesting being 
so interesting when I've been lecturing 

133
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:50,291
to people especially more recently,
and this is also manifested itself on 

134
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,540
Youtube.
I'm talking to people a lot about 

135
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,870
responsibility and it's young men in 
particular that seem to be responding to

136
00:06:56,871 --> 00:07:01,871
that and I think that's partly because I
think that young women in some sense 

137
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:03,500
have their responsibility map already 
laid out for them.

138
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,950
It's also less voluntary in some sense 
for women because they have more 

139
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,860
complicated problems to solve in the 
first part of their life,

140
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,700
right?
Take because they have to get the family

141
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,340
problem solved.
But whatever.

142
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,880
I've been talking very in a very 
delineated matter about responsibility,

143
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,710
which is a strange thing to sell to 
people,

144
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:25,640
but responsibility is what gives your 
life meaning and so then you might say,

145
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:29,420
well then take ultimate responsibility 
and what happens?

146
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,000
You have an ultimately meaningful life.
Then you might say,

147
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,650
well,
if your life is ultimately meaningful,

148
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,840
it doesn't matter if it's punctuated by 
tragedy or even predicated on tragedy.

149
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,010
It's worth it.

150
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,440
And I think that's true,
and it,

151
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,810
everything I've seen indicates to me 
that's true.

152
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:50,290
Every time I get my clients to take on 
more responsibility,

153
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,420
you know,
and it isn't an injunction.

154
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:54,670
You're a bad person.
You should take on responsibility.

155
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,940
It has nothing to do with that.
You can define the damn responsibility.

156
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,700
It isn't something that someone else 
should impose on you.

157
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:04,060
It's not a matter of doing what you 
should do in some abstract manner.

158
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:09,340
It's not that it's the choice of what 
game you're going to play and you know 

159
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:11,920
you can play the game of the seeker,
I would say.

160
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:16,921
And if you play that game,
then everyone wins and it's the best 

161
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:17,440
game you can play.
And so the,

162
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,530
the,
the answer in some sense to the tragedy 

163
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:22,900
of life,
to the catastrophe of life to the fall,

164
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:28,590
is to adopt the responsibility of 
mortality that goes along with that and 

165
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:32,350
to play that game maximally.
And paradoxically,

166
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,320
it's in the willingness to do that,
that the solution emerges.
