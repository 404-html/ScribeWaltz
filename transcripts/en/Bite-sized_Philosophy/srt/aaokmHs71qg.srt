1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:00,590
Yeah,

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,080
oh,
it's an appalling ideology because the 

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,080
people who created it had the idea about
what it should be before they made it.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,210
So it's propaganda.
You can say exactly what frozen is 

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,150
about.
So it's propaganda.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,760
A truly mythologically based story.
You can never fully say what it's about.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,600
You can just talk about it forever and 
ever and ever and ever.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,030
So it's,
it's a wellspring of meaning,

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,150
so.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,010
Oh sure they are.
Of course that's what they're doing.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,600
Oh yeah,
it's calculated marketing.

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,880
Yeah.
Yeah,

13
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,770
sure.
It was hyper politically correct.

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:39,900
Yeah,
yeah.

15
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,580
Yeah.
And they didn't need men and you know,

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,170
God,
give me a break,

17
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,790
you know,
just because you need men doesn't mean 

18
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,740
you have to like them.
Yeah.

19
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:54,741
So,
so I mean I thought a lot about the 

20
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:57,051
difference between propaganda and art.
So art actually a process rather than an

21
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:01,470
end product and with any luck if you 
have a piece of art,

22
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:06,471
the process is embedded in the byproduct
and so it reflects the process when you 

23
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:09,060
bring it into your house.
And so it's an active,

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,270
it's a,
it's a crystallized active exploration 

25
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,780
and the real artist doesn't know what 
they're doing.

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,510
They don't know what they're doing.
They're exploring.

27
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,160
I can,
I can recommend a film.

28
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:25,161
There's a film made of Picasso wouldn't 
boat 1957 and it was a black and white 

29
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:29,541
film and it was actually a film of him 
making a painting and he painted it on 

30
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:29,970
glass so you could see what he was 
doing.

31
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,480
It's really quite fascinating because 
you can see that he's playing,

32
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,570
he sketches it in and then he rubs it 
out so then he sketches it in again and 

33
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,081
he rubs it out and he sketches over here
and it's like there's a real dynamism 

34
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:42,750
about it.
He doesn't plan it out to begin with.

35
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,780
Not that there's necessarily anything 
wrong with that as an artistic endeavor 

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,081
to.
But PAGASA was trying to explore and 

37
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:52,470
understand and you know,
I don't know what you knew about cubism,

38
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:55,140
but cubism.
It's a strange thing.

39
00:01:55,141 --> 00:02:00,141
But what he was doing with his cubism 
was to try to show you that you only see

40
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:05,241
things from one perspective,
but the things exist in multiple 

41
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:05,910
perspective,
so you know,

42
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:10,380
a cubist painting is your face this way 
and your face this way at the same time.

43
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,120
And so you could say,
well,

44
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:17,121
is that a more accurate way of of 
representing a person that just the 

45
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:20,441
standard portrait and Picasso would say,
well in some ways definitely because it 

46
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:23,880
captures the transformative element 
rather than the static element.

47
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,410
And so someone who's a true artist 
doesn't have a political message.

48
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,910
And it's funny because my house is full 
of ideological propaganda from the 

49
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,360
Soviet Union.
It's just packed full of it and it's so 

50
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,761
interesting to watch these artifacts 
because a lot of them were socialist 

51
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:41,880
realist,
although mostly they're impressionist.

52
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:46,881
Really.
It's so interesting to watch them 

53
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:49,161
because in that painting themselves,
there is a war that you can perceive and

54
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:54,381
the war is a lot of the people who made 
these paintings were incredibly 

55
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:54,420
talented,
really,

56
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:56,380
really skilled because the Russians kept
their.

57
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,970
Their Formula Academy's open so the can 
really paint impressionism.

58
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:05,971
It's remarkable,
but their talents were encapsulated 

59
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:09,541
within this what mostly this ideology 
and so in each canvas there's this war 

60
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:14,701
between the ideological message and the 
artistic message and what's so cool is 

61
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:16,360
the farther we get away from the Soviet 
Union,

62
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,630
the more the art winds,
because in 300 years there isn't going 

63
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,241
to be a shred left of that ideology and 
all that will be left to the paintings 

64
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:25,241
is the art,

65
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,180
so

66
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,430
part of the reason that people are so 
attracted to art is because the artist 

67
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,961
actually manifests identity with the 
process of transformation and so that's 

68
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:41,210
why the artist is a cultural hero.
That's also why every nihilist worth his

69
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:44,030
salt wants to be an artist like,
who are you?

70
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,580
What are you going to say?
I'm a nihilist snow.

71
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:47,720
I'm an artist.
It's like,

72
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:48,350
no,
you're not,

73
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,710
but I can see why you want to be.
Right,

74
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,980
right.
Yeah.

75
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,200
Just because you're a failure,
it doesn't mean you're an artist.

76
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:01,950
Right.

77
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,900
Well,
I think it depends on who you are.

78
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,030
Like,
it's really interesting to me,

79
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:12,280
but I'm really interested enough,
you know,

80
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:17,281
and I'm also interested in the way that 
ideologies coopt more fundamental 

81
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:20,050
processes to,
to,

82
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,450
and harness their energy as a,
as a rational and motivating force.

83
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,720
And so for me,
these pieces of art propaganda are 

84
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,330
extremely interesting.
I mean,

85
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,650
it's very interesting to be surrounded 
by them because I can see this war going

86
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,950
on all the time.
So it's very cool.

87
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,530
And there are twinning far as I can 
tell,

88
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,460
so that's very interesting because they 
were pure propaganda,

89
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:53,461
many of them when I bought them.
But it's getting farther and farther 

90
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:56,311
away from the Soviet Union.
So the more architectural elements are 

91
00:04:56,311 --> 00:04:56,950
coming to the forefront.
