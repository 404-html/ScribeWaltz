1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,880
And the sons of Noah,
they went forth of the Ark were shem and

2
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:07,930
ham and Japheth and ham is the father of
Canaan.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,490
These are the three sons of Noah and of 
them was the whole Earth overspread and 

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,650
no began to be a hud.
Husbands,

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,700
men,
and he planted a vineyard and he drank 

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,680
of the wine and was drunk,
and he was uncovered within his tent and

7
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:28,681
Ham.
The father of Canaan saw the nakedness 

8
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:31,261
of his father and told his two brethren 
without and Shem and Japheth took a 

9
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:37,221
garment and laid upon both their 
shoulders and went backward and covered 

10
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:40,821
the nakedness of their father.
And their faces were backward and they 

11
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:43,881
saw not their father's nakedness.
And Noah awoke from his wine and knew 

12
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:46,200
what his younger son had done unto him.
And he said,

13
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,870
curse it to be Canaan.
A servant of servants,

14
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:53,440
shall he be unto his brethren.
And he said,

15
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:57,160
blessed shall be the Lord God of Sham 
and Canaan shall be his servant.

16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,730
And God enlarge Japheth.
And he shall dwell in the tents of Shem 

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,170
and Canaan shall be his servant.
And Noah lived after the flood,

18
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:09,430
350 years and all the days of Noah were 
950 years and he died

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,920
and the whole earth was of one language 
and of one speech.

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,100
Okay.
So I remember thinking about this story,

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,750
it's got to be 30 years ago

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,240
and I think the meaning of the story 
stood out for me.

23
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,050
Sometimes when you read complicated 
materials,

24
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:37,520
sometimes a piece of it will stand out.
It's for some reason like it glitters.

25
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,500
I suppose that might be one way of 
thinking about it.

26
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,270
It's you're in sync with it and you can 
understand what it means.

27
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,580
I've really experienced that reading the
Tao Te Ching,

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,940
which is document I would really like to
do a lecture on at some point because 

29
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,051
some of the verses I don't understand,
but others stand right out and I can 

30
00:01:56,051 --> 00:01:59,081
understand them.
And I think I understood what this part 

31
00:01:59,081 --> 00:01:59,081
of the story of no amount.
And I think it means,

32
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:03,960
you know,
we talked a little bit about what 

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:03,960
nakedness meant in the story of Adam and
eve.

34
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,530
And the idea essentially was that to 
know yourself naked is to become aware 

35
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:11,780
of your vulnerability,
the physical,

36
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,000
your physical boundaries in time and 
space,

37
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,670
and your,
your,

38
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,180
your physiological,
your fundamental physiological 

39
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,320
insufficiencies as they make might be 
judged by others.

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,320
So there's biological insufficiency that
sort of built into you because you're a 

41
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,360
fragile mortal,
vulnerable half insane creature and,

42
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:33,770
and that's,
that's just an existential truth.

43
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:38,090
And then of course,
even merely as a human being,

44
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:43,091
even with all those faults,
there are faults that you have that are 

45
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:45,170
particular to you that might be judged 
harshly by the group while might be,

46
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:47,870
we'll definitely be judged harshly by 
the group.

47
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,390
And so to become aware of your nakedness
is to become self conscious and,

48
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,650
and to,
and to,

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,650
to know your limits and to know your 
vulnerability.

50
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:59,651
And that's what is revealed to when he 
comes across his father naked.

51
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:07,201
It's.
So the question is what does it mean to 

52
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:07,990
see your father naked?
And it seems to me,

53
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:10,250
and especially in an inappropriate 
manner like this,

54
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,730
it,
it,

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,590
it,
it,

56
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,850
it's,
it's,

57
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,880
it's as if ham,
he does the same thing that happens in 

58
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:24,091
the Mesopotamian creation myth when when
timeout an absolute give rise to the 

59
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:29,161
first God's there,
they're the father of the eventual daddy

60
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,120
of redemption,
Marduk there are very careless and noisy

61
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:38,650
and the kill app suit their father and 
attempt to inhabit his corpse.

62
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,710
And that makes timeout enraged.
And so she bursts forth from the 

63
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,230
darkness to do the men.
It's like a precursor to the flood story

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,500
or an analog to the flood story.
And I see the same thing happening here 

65
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,101
with him is that he's,
he's insufficiently respectful of his 

66
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:56,500
father.
And,

67
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,350
and the question is exactly what does 
the father represent?

68
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:00,220
And you can say,
well there's,

69
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,550
there's,
there's the father that you have and 

70
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:05,550
that's a human being.
That's,

71
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,300
that's a man like other men,
a man among men.

72
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,780
But then there's the farther as such.
And that's the spirit of the father.

73
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:14,830
And in so far as you have a father,
you have both at the same time.

74
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:19,420
You have the personal father that's a 
man among other men,

75
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,980
just like anyone out there,
his father,

76
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:23,860
but in so far as that man is your 
father,

77
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:28,861
that means that he's something different
than just another person and what he is 

78
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:33,121
is the incarnation of the spirit of the 
father and to see that,

79
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,320
to take it to what to disrespect that 
carelessly,

80
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,780
maybe even like no,
it makes a mistake,

81
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:40,990
right?

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,520
He produces wine and gets himself drunk 
and you might say,

83
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:46,240
well,
you know,

84
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:48,790
if he's sprawled out there for everyone 
to see,

85
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,950
it's hardly hams fault if he stumbles 
across him,

86
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:55,951
but the book is laying out a danger and 
the danger is that,

87
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,890
well,
maybe you catch your father at his most 

88
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,310
vulnerable moment and if you're 
disrespectful,

89
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,760
then you transgress against the spirit 
of the father and if you transgress 

90
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,081
against the spirit of father and lose 
the spirit of the father and lose 

91
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:16,261
respect for the spirit of the father,
then that is likely to transform you 

92
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,420
into a slave.
That's a very interesting idea and I 

93
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,470
think it's particularly interesting.
Maybe not particularly interesting,

94
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:26,200
but it's.
It's particularly Germane.

95
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,660
I think to our current cultural 
situation,

96
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:33,661
because I think that were pushed 
constantly to see the nakedness of our 

97
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:34,690
father,
so to speak,

98
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:41,010
because of the intense criticism that's 
directed towards our culture and the 

99
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,440
patriarchal culture,
so to speak.

100
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,130
We're constantly exposing its weaknesses
and vulnerabilities and let's say 

101
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,050
nakedness and there's nothing wrong with
criticism,

102
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:58,051
but the thing about criticism is the 
purpose of criticism is to separate 

103
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:02,050
wheat from the chaff.
It's not the burn everything to the 

104
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:02,050
ground,
right?

105
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:02,050
It's to say,
well,

106
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,720
we're going to carefully look at this.
We're going to carefully differentiate.

107
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:10,721
We're going to keep what's good and 
we're going to move away from what's 

108
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:13,181
bad,
but the point of the criticism isn't to 

109
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:13,880
identify everything is bad.
It's two separate.

110
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:18,881
What's good from what's bad so that you 
can retain what's good and move towards 

111
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:23,090
it and to be careless at that is deadly 
because you're inhabited by the spirit 

112
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,430
of the father.
Right?

113
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:27,770
In so far as you're a cultural 
construction,

114
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:32,771
which of course is something that the.
The postmodern neo Marxist sort 

115
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:36,110
absolutely emphatic about.
You're a cultural construction in so far

116
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:41,111
as you're a cultural construction than 
your inhabited by the spirit of the 

117
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:44,261
father,
and to be disrespectful towards that 

118
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:47,480
means to undermine the very structure 
that makes you not all of what you are.

119
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,610
Certainly certainly not all of what you 
are,

120
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:54,611
but a good portion of what you are in so
far as you're a socialized cultural 

121
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:58,991
entity and if you pull out,
if you pull the foundation out from 

122
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:01,460
underneath that,
what do you have left?

123
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,800
You can hardly manage on your own.
You know,

124
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,850
it's just not possible.
You're a cultural creation and so hamm 

125
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,280
makes this desperate error and is 
careless about exposing himself to the 

126
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,820
vulnerability of his father.
Something like that.

127
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:24,821
He does it without sufficient respect 
and the judgment is that not only will 

128
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:30,041
he be a slave,
but so will all of his descendants and 

129
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,161
these contrasted with the other two sons
who I suppose are willing to give their 

130
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:35,720
father the benefit of the doubt.
Something like that.

131
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,600
And so when they see him in a 
compromising position,

132
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,110
they handle it with respect and,
and,

133
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,480
and don't capitalize on it.
And maybe that makes them strong,

134
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,020
that's what it seems to me.
And so I think that's what that story 

135
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,381
means.
It has something to do with respect,

136
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,920
you know,
and the funny thing about having respect

137
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:04,921
for your culture,
and I suppose that's partly why I'm 

138
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:05,180
doing the biblical stories is because 
they're part of,

139
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,280
they're part of my culture.
They're part of our culture perhaps,

140
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:14,050
but they're certainly part of my culture
and it seems to me that

141
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,840
it's worthwhile to treat that with 
respect to see what you can glean from 

142
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,340
it and,
and not kick it when it's down,

143
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:25,830
let's say.
So.

144
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,970
And so that's how the story of Noah 
ends,

145
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:40,030
you know.
And the thing too is Noah is actually a 

146
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,500
pretty decent incarnation of the spirit 
of the father.

147
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:47,501
That which I suppose is one of the 
things that makes Hams misstep more 

148
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:50,130
egregious is that,
I mean,

149
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,140
no,
I just built an ark and got everybody 

150
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,140
through the flood.
Man,

151
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,140
you know,
it's not so bad in.

152
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,681
So maybe the fact that he happened to 
drink too much wine one day wasn't 

153
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:03,270
enough to justify humiliating him.
And you know,

154
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I don't think it's pushing the limits of
symbolic interpretation to note on a 

155
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,860
daily basis that were all contained in 
an arc.

156
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,670
Right?
And that's the arc that you can think 

157
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,310
about that as the arc that's been 
bequeathed to us by our forefathers.

158
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,120
That's the tremendous infrastructure 
that we inhabit,

159
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,840
that we take for granted because it 
works so well that protects us from 

160
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,170
things that we can't even imagine.

161
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,720
And we don't have to imagine because 
we're so well protected.

162
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,140
And so one of the things that's really 
struck me hard,

163
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,470
I would say about the disintegration and
corruption of the universities is the 

164
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,670
absolute in gratitude that goes along 
with that.

165
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,700
You know,
criticism as I said,

166
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:49,701
is a fine thing if it's done in the 
spirit in a proper spirit and that's the

167
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:52,050
spirit of separating the wheat from the 
chaff.

168
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,360
But it needs to be accompanied by 
gratitude.

169
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,950
And it does seem to me that anyone who 
lives in in the west,

170
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:04,270
in the western culture at this time,
in history and in this place and who 

171
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:09,170
isn't similar [inaudible] grateful for 
that is,

172
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,590
is,
is half blind at least because it's 

173
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,250
never been better than this.
And it could be so much worse.

174
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,190
And it's highly likely that it will be 
so much worse.

175
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,420
Because for most of human history,
so much worse is the norm.
