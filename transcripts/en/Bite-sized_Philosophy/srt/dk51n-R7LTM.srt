1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,260
Well,
what about trump?

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,370
What's going on there?
What's going on there?

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:06,390
Exactly.
You know,

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,540
it was interesting listening to trump's 
inauguration speech because are detected

5
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:14,040
elements of national socialist thought 
in it,

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,440
you know,
and not being dismissive.

7
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:21,441
I'm seriously not being dismissive,
but when you radically activate on the 

8
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:26,541
side of the left,
you call forth compensatory forces and 

9
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:29,070
they're not in your control.
And like Trump opened his speech.

10
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:32,070
You just read it.
It sounds like a 1950 socialist,

11
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:34,350
you know,
he's going to use the power of the state

12
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:37,560
to bring the industry home to produce a 
lot of infrastructure.

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,830
It's a state business unity with the 
state in charge.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,100
And then at the end of his speech,
which is where he stopped speaking,

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,470
at least the international kind of 
socialist,

16
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:47,280
he says,
well,

17
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,670
borders are really important and so is 
national identity and you know,

18
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:54,660
he does embed that within belief in God,
which is probably a good thing,

19
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:56,700
assuming that he's serious about that.

20
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,970
But you know,
the fact that trump was elected in the 

21
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,800
end,
that there was such a fight between him 

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,421
and the Clintonites and that the Clinton
nights were playing identity politics 

23
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:09,060
instead of speaking for the working 
class,

24
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,670
who then trump co-opted,
like he should have.

25
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,430
Um,
there there's a war going on there.

26
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:16,860
And then what about brexit?
What's going on there?

27
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:18,810
And what about France with Marine Le 
Pen?

28
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:22,020
And what about Holland with wilderness?
You know,

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,100
watch it.
We're in a chaotic time and you know,

30
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:29,760
I've got letters from people all over 
the world who tell me how they can't say

31
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:30,870
what they think.
It's like,

32
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:35,871
oh,
well that's not very good and they're 

33
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:37,671
kind of happy with me because maybe they
think that are emboldened them in some 

34
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:38,250
way and so good,
good for that.

35
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,670
Hypothetically.
And most of the people who wrote me the 

36
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,670
overwhelming majority were reasonable.

37
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,510
So pretty happy about that too.
But,

38
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,230
and maybe I'm wrong about my damn 
diagnosis because like what do I know?

39
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:54,231
But I do have this proclivity to get to 
the bottom of things and what's out the 

40
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:57,340
bottom of this as an ideological war or 
philosophical war.

41
00:01:57,341 --> 00:02:02,341
It's even deeper than that.
It might even be deeper than a 

42
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:05,061
philosophical bore,
which is something that's more like a 

43
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:05,430
metaphysical or theological war.
You know?

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,440
It depends on how far down you look and 
the postmodernist know exactly what 

45
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,830
they're doing.
This isn't accidental.

46
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:15,831
Of course you shut down speakers you 
don't agree with because you can't have 

47
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:17,970
a dialogue within then anyways because 
human beings can't have dialogue.

48
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,680
There's no such thing as a human 
individual.

49
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,920
There's no such thing as truth.
Here's the postmodern world.

50
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,910
It's the hogs nightmare.
It's everyone against everyone else 

51
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,130
except it's not individuals.

52
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,910
It's groups and you're stuck in your 
damn group and it's the only thing about

53
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:34,260
you anyways,
that's relevant,

54
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,660
which is why we might base our hiring on
it,

55
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:41,661
for example,
and you're oppressed and even if you 

56
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,051
don't know it just only because you've 
internalized it and it's the only thing 

57
00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:48,051
that's real about you anyways.
And I can't talk to you because I'm in 

58
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:52,071
my own little silo of privileged belief 
and besides we can't use logic because 

59
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:56,331
that doesn't exist and so you're in a 
group and I'm in a group and all we can 

60
00:02:56,331 --> 00:03:00,171
do is have a war or we can talk,
but we don't get to talk because he 

61
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:03,010
can't talk if you're a postmodernist 
because speech is just chatter,

62
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,840
so when it's just chatter that supports 
the people in power,

63
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:12,841
that's how they think and so the whole 
world is this little arm war of identity

64
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:16,330
group against identity group against 
identity group,

65
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,220
and you shut down people who don't agree
with you because why should you let them

66
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:21,760
talk?

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,930
It's you don't believe in any of the 
reasons why you would let someone talk.

68
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,770
So this isn't accidental.
It's not [inaudible] they're afraid.

69
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,040
Although it's also because of that,
they hijack,

70
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,900
you know,
fear.

71
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:39,040
They hijack compassion.
They make anyone who who puts forward an

72
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:44,041
alternative view into a terrorist of 
ideas and someone who's heartless at the

73
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,020
core,
which is really incredibly intelligent.

74
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:52,021
It's such a good strategy.
It's so devious and brilliant and it's 

75
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:56,401
so effective because who wants to,
who the hell wants to be labeled a 

76
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:57,350
bigot?
You probably are a damn big.

77
00:03:57,351 --> 00:04:00,430
It's just like everyone else.
So you know,

78
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:02,590
and it's easy to make people feel guilty
about that.

79
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:03,760
Maybe they should.
