1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,180
No,
I think the idea of white privilege is 

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:05,890
absolutely reprehensible and it's not 
because white people aren't,

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,750
you know,
we have all sorts of privileges and most

4
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:15,751
people have privileges of all sorts and 
you should be grateful for your 

5
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:15,970
privileges and work to deserve them,
I would say.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,450
But the idea that you can target an 
ethnic group with a collective crime 

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,850
regardless of the specific innocence or 
guilt of the constituent elements of 

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,931
that group,
there is absolutely nothing that's more 

9
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:31,360
racist than that.
It's absolutely a boring.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:31,760
I can't

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,660
thank you.

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:44,190
If you,
if you really want to know more about 

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,051
that sort of thing,
you should read about the Kulaks in the 

14
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:46,051
Soviet Union in the 19 twenties,
k,

15
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:48,250
u l a,
k s because they were.

16
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,830
They were farmers who were very 
productive.

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,000
They were the most productive element of
the agricultural strata in,

18
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,050
in Russia.
And they were virtually all killed or 

19
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,230
raped and robbed by the collectivists 
who insisted that because they showed 

20
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:06,370
signs of wealth,
they were criminals.

21
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:07,120
And,
and,

22
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,190
and,
and,

23
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,670
and,
and Roberts.

24
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,570
So,
and the one of the consequences of the 

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,290
prosecution of the Kulaks was the death 
of 6 million Ukrainians from a famine in

26
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:22,291
the 19 thirties.
The idea of collectively held guilt at 

27
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:26,281
the level of the individual as a legal 
or philosophical principle is dangerous.

28
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,730
It's precisely this sort of danger that 
people who are really looking for 

29
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,240
trouble would push.
So and,

30
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:39,270
and just a cursory glance at 20th 
century history should teach anyone who 

31
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,010
wants to know exactly how,
how unacceptable that is.
