1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,830
One thing that I'd been doing in my tour
repeatedly when I talk about the first 

2
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:11,301
chapter of my book,
which is stand up straight with your 

3
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:13,581
shoulders back,
it's a discussion of hierarchies and 

4
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:13,581
their eternal nature,
right?

5
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:14,730
Because my claim is,
and it's not my claim,

6
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:19,731
I think it's mirror fact that organisms 
that have to cooperate and compete with 

7
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:27,741
other organisms have their type 
inevitably arranged themselves into 

8
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:30,300
hierarchies and that's been going on for
so long,

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:30,750
which,
uh,

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,900
which is at least 300 million years that
our nervous systems have adapted to 

11
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:40,971
hierarchies as if they're a permanent 
element of being right,

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,430
more permanent than trees,
like seriously permanent at the most 

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,710
fundamental neurochemical,
the one that regulates the entire brain.

14
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:53,760
Serotonin is acutely sensitive to 
hierarchical distinctions.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,120
And so that's part of the proposition.
So the reason I laid that proposition 

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,781
forward was to say whatever pitfalls 
hierarchies might produce,

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,870
you cannot lay them at the feet of the 
West Patriarchy or capitalism.

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,060
It's like that's a nonstarter.
You're wrong and not just a little bit 

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,261
wrong.
You're so seriously wrong that if you 

20
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:20,811
insist upon doing that,
you won't even achieve your own aims 

21
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:22,020
because you're actually not grappling 
with the problem.

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,840
The problem is if hierarchies are a 
problem,

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,140
which they are,
the problem is way more serious than 

24
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,920
mere capitalist.
It's way deeper and if you're actually 

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,240
interested in rectifying the constantly 
the negative consequences of 

26
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:43,311
hierarchies,
then you're going to have to get a lot 

27
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:43,560
more sophisticated than their,
than your idiot Marxism.

28
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,300
So,
so,

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,910
so part of the elaboration of that 
argument is,

30
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:52,911
well,
hierarchies are inevitable because we 

31
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:54,360
have to solve complex problems and we 
have to solve them socially.

32
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,390
And when you implement a solution to a 
complex problem,

33
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:02,391
socially you produce a hierarchy because
some people are better at the 

34
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:04,380
implementation than others.
So there's a hierarchy of competence and

35
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:07,860
then there's a hierarchy of distribution
of the spoils.

36
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,500
And so,
and in both of those hierarchies,

37
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:15,501
you get a disproportionate clumping of 
resources at the top and dispossession 

38
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:17,670
at the bottle and the nature of 
hierarchies.

39
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,030
So what's the left for?
The left is to remind those who are 

40
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:28,521
benefiting from the hierarchies that the
hierarchy comes at a cost and the cost 

41
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:35,061
is the clumping of people at the bottom 
and that that's an eternal cost and it's

42
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:40,401
not trivial,
and so that's what the left should be 

43
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:43,881
properly focused on.
The left should be providing the voice 

44
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:47,661
of those who are dispossessed by 
hierarchies and the right should be 

45
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:47,661
saying,
yeah,

46
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,040
but the damn hierarchies are necessary 
and they're not only necessary,

47
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,090
but there are also productive than the 
left says yes,

48
00:02:57,091 --> 00:03:02,091
but they tilt towards tyranny and they 
can be occupied inappropriately by 

49
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:07,681
people who are playing games of power.
Fair enough to write has to take that 

50
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:07,720
into account.

51
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,010
The hierarchy can rigidity,
rigidity,

52
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,480
and is likely to do that.
And it can be taken over by people who 

53
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,990
are corrupt and that's likely to happen.
And so,

54
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,600
but,
but it's okay because the dialogue could

55
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:22,000
work out the right can say,
well yeah,

56
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:27,001
we need the damn hierarchies and they 
need to be buttressed and the left can 

57
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:30,091
say yes,
but they have to be maintained property 

58
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:31,930
so they don't deteriorate and 
degenerate.

59
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,400
And,
and I think that's,

60
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,430
I think that's ancient wisdom.
I think the ancient Egyptians had 

61
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,040
figured that out in their symbolic 
representations.

62
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,460
So now when the left goes too far,
it does something like say,

63
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,180
well,
how about no hierarchy?

64
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:46,990
It's like,
no,

65
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:51,991
how about not wrong?
Because all that happens if you fly.

66
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,240
One of the things that happens if you 
flatten out the hierarchy is that you 

67
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,240
can't even organize your perceptions.

68
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,570
You can't perceive the world without 
looking at the world through a hierarchy

69
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:06,571
of value.
And if because you can't perceive the 

70
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:09,841
world unless you make one thing more 
important than all the other things 

71
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:09,841
because you don't even know what to look
at,

72
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,340
and if one thing isn't more important 
than all the other things,

73
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:14,740
then you have nothing to aim at.
If you have nothing to aim at,

74
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:19,741
then you have no meaning in your life.
So the left can't just demolish the 

75
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,820
hierarchies in the name of some equality
of outcome,

76
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:24,400
let's say,
because you blow out the future,

77
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:29,401
you leave people aimless,
and you destroyed the very institutions 

78
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:30,730
that allow people to make competent 
progress in the world.

79
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,300
That's not an acceptable outcome,
so we have to,

80
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,720
we have to agree to live with the 
tension necessity for hierarchies that 

81
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:46,431
proclivity for them to pathologize and 
the necessary voice of the left and 

82
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:49,030
speaking for the.
For the dispossessed.
