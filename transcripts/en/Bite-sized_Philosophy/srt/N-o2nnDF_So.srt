1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,800
So what does it mean for this symbol to 
emerge from the feminine symbol,

2
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:06,900
let's say,
to emerge from chaos?

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:08,670
Well,
this picture,

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,340
this is a picture of Venus,
the goddess of love,

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,520
right?
And so I cut this picture out of a 

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,801
larger picture and it's Venus 
manifesting yourself in a transcendent 

7
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:22,461
space in the sky in the same way that 
Christ did in the previous 

8
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:23,940
representation and she has raised coming
off her.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,350
And there's all these men who are nights
kneeling in front of the image.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,760
Well,
what does that mean?

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,020
Well,
it means that men use the image of 

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,020
female perfection to motivate 
themselves.

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,310
And that's exactly right.
That's precisely what they do.

14
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:43,311
You see that in the Tom Sawyer story.
So Tom Sawyer is about 12 years old and 

15
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:47,751
he's still hanging around with his 
friends like huck Finn and this word 

16
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:51,060
girl moves across the street,
becky and she comes out and he's struck 

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,201
by her for the first time in his life,
something's changed and the first thing 

18
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,330
he does is hot pop on a picket fence and
show off and balance in front of her.

19
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:57,810
And he's saying,
well,

20
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:58,930
look at me,
look at me.

21
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:03,931
I'm,
he's like the male bowerbird building 

22
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:04,320
something beautiful so the female will 
approve of it and it's,

23
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,750
it's motivation,
you know?

24
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:10,920
And that's something that I think modern
women don't really understand about men.

25
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,130
They don't understand that at least to 
the degree that males are uncorrupted 

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,450
and not better because of being 
rejected,

27
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:23,451
they're doing everything they can to 
kneel before the eternal image of the 

28
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:23,451
feminine

29
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,850
and try to make themselves worthy as the
chivalry story.

30
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:33,851
Right?
That's what you should encourage your 

31
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:35,621
partner.
So and so out of chaos emerges this 

32
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:36,260
first form.
It's the feminine form.

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,800
It's partly the form that represents 
novelty as such so and,

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,820
and on one hand its promise,
on the other hand it's threat that you 

35
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,840
wouldn't believe.
And I don't know because I don't know.

36
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,020
I don't understand the situation with 
women as well as I understand the 

37
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,510
situation with men.
Obviously being a man,

38
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,500
but I don't know if women have any idea 
how paralyzing they are to especially 

39
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:03,590
young men,
a large,

40
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,260
very large number of my clinical 
clients,

41
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:11,261
but also young men I've talked to in 
general are absolutely terrified of 

42
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:15,380
women because they're terrified of being
rejected and the terror exist in precise

43
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:17,690
proportion to the retraction,
to the woman,

44
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,900
which is a horrible paradoxical 
situation to be in.

45
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:25,901
It's often why man makes such fools of 
themselves in front of women that 

46
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,320
they're attracted to.
It's because first of all,

47
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:32,321
they don't see the woman that they're 
attracted to because what the hell do 

48
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:32,870
they know about her?
They don't see her as an individual.

49
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,260
They see her as the manifestation of a 
judgmental ideal and then it's only in 

50
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:43,451
establishing the relationship with the 
actual woman that they can start 

51
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:46,490
differentiating between the judgmental 
ideal and the actual individual woman.

52
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,210
And that also requires the sacrifice and
the sacrifice is

53
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,610
you never can have an ideal woman.
So to have a relationship with any 

54
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:59,240
woman,
you have to sacrifice the relationship,

55
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,140
the ideal woman,
and you have to see the individual woman

56
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,970
and separate her from the ideal,
and that's the same thing that happens 

57
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,610
to the hero in sleeping beauty,
right?

58
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:14,611
He sees the evil queen who actually 
turns into the dragon of chaos and it's 

59
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,110
not until he can,
he can defeat her,

60
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,890
that he can establish a relationship 
with the actual princess.

61
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,070
And that's exactly the case.
I had a wonderful my clients who ran 

62
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,760
this men's group,
which was quite interesting.

63
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:32,761
One of the things they had initiates do,
which was very intelligent,

64
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:36,890
was to go out and ask 50 women in one 
day for their phone numbers.

65
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,850
Why politely,
properly you don't want.

66
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,780
It wasn't.
It wasn't a,

67
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,850
it was a game,
but it wasn't a stupid game.

68
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,180
And the idea was get over your fear of 
rejection and how do you do that by 

69
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:54,761
encountering it continually and 
continually and continually so that 

70
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,660
you're no longer paralyzed by this.
