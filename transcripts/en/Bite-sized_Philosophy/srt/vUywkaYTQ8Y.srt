1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,690
What should move forward in time with me
and what should be let go as if it's 

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,320
dead wood and the more dead wood that 
you let go of and burn off when you have

3
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:12,660
the opportunity.
The last it accretes around you here.

4
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:14,940
Here's something interesting about 
forest fires.

5
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:18,360
You know people have been trying to 
prevent forest fires for a long time,

6
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:20,490
especially that am bear smokey,
right?

7
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:25,491
He's trying to prevent forest fires and 
so because forest fires burn up the 

8
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:29,550
forest and that can't be good,
but here's what happens if you don't let

9
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:34,551
forest fires burned,
is that while forests collect a lot of 

10
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:35,910
dry branches,
right?

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,920
Because tree branches die and would 
falls on the forest floor and collects 

12
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:46,761
and so the amount of flammable material 
keeps increasing with time and that's 

13
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:53,061
not so bad if it's wet,
but if the amount of flammable material 

14
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:55,620
is increasing and it gets really dry and
then it burns,

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,090
then you have a real problem.

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,600
The forest fire can burn so hot that it 
burns route,

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,640
topsoil right off,
in which case you don't have a forest at

18
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:07,670
all anymore.
You just have a desert and low.

19
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:10,920
Lots of trees are evolved to withstand 
forest fires,

20
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:15,921
have a certain intensity and some won't 
even release their seeds unless there's 

21
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:20,661
been a fire and so a little bit of fire 
at the right time can stop everything 

22
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:26,220
from burning to the ground,
and that's also a really useful insight,

23
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:28,800
a metaphorical insight into the nature 
of sacrifice,

24
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:33,801
right?
It's also a lot easier to let go of 

25
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:36,471
something when you're deciding to let go
of it because you've decided yourself 

26
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,160
that you're done with that.
It's a weak part of you.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,130
It needs to disappear.
You do that yourself.

28
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:45,720
It's much better and much easier than it
is if it's taken away from you forcibly,

29
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:47,460
in which case you're very much likely to
fight it.

30
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,230
These other.
There's another interesting thing here,

31
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,910
a motif that runs through the entire 
Bible.

32
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:58,911
It's a very,
very powerful motif and it's partly 

33
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,461
associated with this idea of walking 
with or walking before God and in the 

34
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:04,380
New Testament,
Christ says something like,

35
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,900
my father's will be done and he means 
that that will should be done through 

36
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,170
him,
and so I can't.

37
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:14,670
I won't be able to state this exactly 
right,

38
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:16,440
but it's something like this,
you know,

39
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:21,441
a lot of what people regard as their own
personalities and and are proud of about

40
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,300
their own personalities,
aren't their own personalities at all.

41
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:29,301
They're useless idiosyncrasies that 
defer them,

42
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,280
differentiate them trivially from other 
people,

43
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,680
but they have no value in and of 
themselves.

44
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:39,681
They're more like quirks.
I remember once I was trying to teach a 

45
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:43,521
particularly stubborn student about how 
to write and she had written a number of

46
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:50,331
essays in university and got universally
walloped for them and the reason for 

47
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:53,370
that was she couldn't write really at 
all.

48
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:58,371
She was really,
really bad at writing and so I was 

49
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:02,211
sitting down with her trying to explain 
to her what she was doing wrong and she 

50
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:06,190
was being very annoying about it.
Very recalcitrant,

51
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:07,900
very,
very unwilling to listen.

52
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,390
That was a pearls before swine thing,
you know,

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,500
and at one point she said it did.
I can write perfectly well,

54
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:19,501
this university professors just don't 
like my style and I could feel my hands 

55
00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:19,690
creep towards her neck.

56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,260
Yeah,
well maybe that'd be funny if it wasn't 

57
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260
true,
but it was also true,

58
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,500
you know,
and I thought what the Hell is with you?

59
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,420
You can't even write and you think you 
have a style and not only do you.

60
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,500
Yeah,
no,

61
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,300
not knowing how to write is not a style.
That's the other point.

62
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:46,530
Right.
And so,

63
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:47,580
you know,
she,

64
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,180
she instead of humbling herself,
which was necessary and.

65
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:51,730
Okay.
Right,

66
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,100
because she was a new university 
students,

67
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:54,450
like of course you don't know how to 
write.

68
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,100
When were you going to learn in school?

69
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,170
I think so.

70
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,940
So she had this,
you know,

71
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:06,750
this,
this,

72
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,150
this style issue in it.
It just,

73
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:12,270
it just didn't go anywhere at all.
And so now,

74
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,310
let's see,
I lost my train of thought telling you,

75
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,500
telling you all those jokes,
don't we asked in terms of above letting

76
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:20,700
things burn off.
Yeah.

77
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:25,701
Well,
so she was proud of her insufficiency 

78
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:25,701
outs.
Arrogance,

79
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:25,701
right?
That's not humility.

80
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:28,560
It's self deception and arrogance to be 
proud of your insufficiency.

81
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:33,561
That's a very foolish thing.
And that means to cling to the parts of 

82
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:33,561
you that are dead.
Okay?

83
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:36,660
Now there's this idea that runs through 
the Bible,

84
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:38,490
I think as a whole that.

85
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,330
Okay,
I'll tell you another little side story 

86
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:47,330
here.
I was reading about socrates today and I

87
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,660
was reading about socrates trial,
you know,

88
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,100
he was tried by the Athenians for 
corrupting,

89
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,670
for,
for failing to worship the gods and 

90
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,550
corrupting the youth of Athens by like 
teaching them stuff and asking them 

91
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:01,550
questions,
you know,

92
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,721
which is great way to corrupt people.
And so he knew the trial was coming and 

93
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,950
Athens wasn't a very big place in 
Atlanta,

94
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,160
about 25,000
people.

95
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:16,161
Everybody knew everybody.
Everybody knew who the powerful guys 

96
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:16,161
were in everybody,
including socrates,

97
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:20,661
knew that the trial was a warning.
Do like get out of town,

98
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:25,791
right?
So we're going to put you on trial in 

99
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,130
six months.
And the potential penalty is death.

100
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,050
God,
that it's like.

101
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,950
So.
So socrates had a chat with his 

102
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,381
compatriots and they were contemplating 
fair means and foul to set up a defense 

103
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:42,351
for him so that he could or to leave so 
that he could not be tried and put to 

104
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:42,351
death.

105
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,630
And he decided that he wasn't going to 
do that and he also decided that he 

106
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:51,180
wasn't going to even think about his 
defense.

107
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,190
And he said,
why?

108
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,800
This is quite an interesting thing.
He said,

109
00:05:55,801 --> 00:06:00,801
why?
He told one of his friends that he had 

110
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:04,190
this voice in his head,
Damon the spirit,

111
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:08,960
something like that,
that he always listened to in that.

112
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:13,961
That was one of the reasons he was 
different from other people because he 

113
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:13,961
always listened to this thing.
It didn't tell him what to do,

114
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:18,221
but it told him what not to do.
It always told them what not to do and 

115
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:18,920
if it told them not to do something,
then he didn't do it.

116
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:23,900
If he was speaking and the little voice 
came up and said no.

117
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,050
Then he shut up and he tried to say 
something else and he was very emphatic 

118
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,831
about this and he said that when he 
tried to plan to evade the trial or even

119
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:36,980
to mount his own defense,
the voice came up and said,

120
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:37,940
no,

121
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,920
don't bother with it.
And he thought,

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,130
well,
what?

123
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,750
What the hell do you mean by that?
Like there's a trial coming and I'm 

124
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,711
going to be put to death,
and while he eventually concluded that 

125
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,530
he was an old guy in the next 10 years,
he was in his seventies,

126
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:58,470
perhaps the next 10 years weren't going 
to be that great forum.

127
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,650
He got a chance,
maybe the gods were giving them a chance

128
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:02,960
just to bow out,
you know,

129
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,110
to put his inferiors in order to say 
goodbye to everyone to avoid that last 

130
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,320
descent into catastrophe,
which might've been particularly painful

131
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:15,321
for a philosopher and to and to walk off
the world on his own terms,

132
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,140
something like that.
The point I'm making with that is 

133
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,160
socrates attended to this internal voice
that at least told them what not to do 

134
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,830
and then he didn't do it.
And of course socrates was a very 

135
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,321
remarkable man and we still hear about 
them today and we know that he existed 

136
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:37,561
and all of those things.
And so back to the back to the walking 

137
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:41,480
with God idea.
You know,

138
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,060
as you elevate your aim,

139
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,870
you

140
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,450
create a judge at the same time.
Right?

141
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,730
Because the new ideal,
which is an ideal you,

142
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,520
even if it's just an ideal position that
you might occupy,

143
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:58,040
even if it's still conceptualized in 
that concrete way,

144
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,070
that becomes a judge because it's above 
you,

145
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,330
right?
And then you're,

146
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,380
you're terrified of it.
Maybe that's why you might be afraid 

147
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:07,380
when you go start a new job,
right?

148
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,710
Because this thing is above you and 
you're terrified of it and,

149
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:10,490
uh,
judges you.

150
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,730
And that's useful because the judge that
you're creating by formulating the ideal

151
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,550
tells you what's useless about yourself 
and then you can dispense with it and 

152
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:27,041
you wanted to keep doing that.
And then every time you make a judge 

153
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,591
that's more elevated,
then there's more useless you that has 

154
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:32,141
to be dispensed with.
And then if you create an ultimate 

155
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:33,560
judge,
which is what the archetypal imagination

156
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:36,800
of humankind has done,
say with the figure of Christ,

157
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:41,801
because if Christ is nothing else,
he is at least the archetypical perfect 

158
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:41,801
man.

159
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:43,940
And therefore the judge.
You have a judge that says,

160
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,390
get rid of everything about yourself 
that isn't perfect.

161
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,830
Of course,
that's also what Abraham.

162
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,750
That's also what God tells Abraham,
right?

163
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:55,751
He says to be perfect,
to pick on ideal that's high enough and 

164
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:57,420
you can do this.
The thing that's interesting about this,

165
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:59,700
I think as you can do it more or less on
your own terms,

166
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,760
you have to have some collaboration from
other people,

167
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:05,040
but you don't have to pick an external 
ideal.

168
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,400
You can pick an ideal that fulfills the 
role of ideal for you.

169
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:09,120
You can say,
okay,

170
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:13,770
well if things could be set up for me 
the way I need them to be and if I could

171
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:17,220
be who I needed to be,
what would that look like?

172
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,430
And you can figure that out for yourself
and then instantly you have a judge.

173
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,410
And I also think that's part of the 
reason people don't do it right?

174
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,520
Why don't.
Why don't people look up and move ahead 

175
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:28,520
and answer is,
well,

176
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,940
you know,
you start formulating an ideal.

177
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:34,941
You formulate a judge.
It's pretty easy to feel intimidated in 

178
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,750
the face of your own ideal.
That's what happens to cane versus able,

179
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:41,751
for example.
Then it's really easy to destroy the 

180
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:42,780
ideal instead of to try to pursue it 
because then you get rid of the judge,

181
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,110
but it's way better lower the damn judge
if it's too much like if your current 

182
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,910
ambition is crushing you,
you know,

183
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,920
then maybe you're playing the tyrant to 
yourself and you should tap down your 

184
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,821
ambitions,
not get rid of them by any stretch of 

185
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:00,921
the imagination,
but at least put the more reasonably 

186
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:01,800
within your grasp.
You don't have to leap from point one to

187
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,660
point 50 in one leap,
right?

188
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,900
You can do it incrementally,
but I really liked this idea.

189
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:11,901
I think it's a profound idea that the 
process of recapitulating yourself 

190
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:16,980
continually is also the process of it's 
a phoenix like process,

191
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:21,981
right?
You're shedding all those elements of 

192
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:24,441
you that are no longer worthy of the 
pursuits that your that you're valuing,

193
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,060
and then I would say the idea here is 
that as you do that,

194
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:35,150
you shape yourself ever more precisely 
into something that can withstand the 

195
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:41,331
tragedy of life and that can act as a,
as a beacon to the world.

196
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:42,900
That's the right way of thinking about 
it,

197
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:45,600
maybe first to your friends and then to 
your family.

198
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,900
It's like it's a hell of a finance 
vision and there's no reason that it 

199
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:50,900
can't happen.
You know,

200
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,521
every one of you knows people who are 
really bloody useful in a crisis and 

201
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:55,650
people that you admire,
right?

202
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:57,810
Those are all you can think of.
All those people,

203
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:02,811
as you admire that you admire us partial
incarnations of the archetypal Messiah.

204
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,020
That's exactly right,
and the more that that manifests itself 

205
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,131
at any given person,
then the more generally useful and 

206
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,401
admirable that person is in a multitude 
of situations and we don't know the 

207
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:20,601
limit to that,
but people can be unbelievably good for 

208
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:20,601
things.
You know?

209
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:21,660
It's really something to behold.
