1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,810
You know,
the,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,280
the right wing is really hard on the 
Frankfurt school,

3
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:10,281
you know,
in the Frankfurt school where these 

4
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:11,721
kinds of neo Marxist guys who combined 
Marxism with Friday and Islam in the 19 

5
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:16,960
forties and,
and they were avowed neo Marxists,

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,970
you know,
so it's not like I'm making an 

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,860
accusation and they were kind of anti 
system type people and,

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,280
and all of that.
But I think to lay what's happening at 

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,311
the universities and in brought out in 
the broader culture itself at the feet 

10
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:35,511
of the Frankfurt school is insufficient.
I really think that it's primarily a 

11
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:37,440
consequence of the French intellectuals 
who,

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,950
and this is obviously an 
oversimplification who emerged out of 

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,060
Marxism in the early 19 seventies and 
produce postmodernism.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,120
Now the thing about the postmodernist 
types is there nested inside Marxism.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,240
They say that straight out.
I'm not inventing this reed Darragh 

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,800
who's like the joker at the,
at the head of the postmodernist 

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:00,800
movement.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,840
And I mean joker because he,
he's,

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,140
he's an intellectual clown.
And that doesn't mean he's stupid 

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,640
because he is not stupid.
Not at all.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,700
These people are not stupid.
They know exactly what they're doing,

22
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:16,701
they know precisely what they're doing.
They're a hell of a lot more educated 

23
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:16,740
about what they're doing.
Then you are less.

24
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:20,040
You happen to be one of them and they 
mean exactly what they say,

25
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,070
just like people always do when they 
tell you what they're going to do or 

26
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,730
they write it down and they say straight
out on their websites,

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,350
say that women's studies websites,
we think the patriarchy is an oppressive

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,740
structure that should be broken down to 
its core and they mean core conceptions.

29
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,410
It's not just social,
it's linguistic,

30
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,340
philosophical and attitudinal.
It should be broken down,

31
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,820
was wiped out and restructured from the 
bottom up and they mean that.

32
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,250
So when it's not accidental.
Any of this,

33
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:57,270
and I know it sounds like a bloody 
paranoid conspiracy theory,

34
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:58,350
but you know,
I've.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,910
I've always been of the idea,
especially from reading young ideas.

36
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,540
People don't have ideas.
Ideas have people,

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,080
and these are powerful ideas.
There's a good book called explaining 

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,021
postmodernism that I might recommend by 
a guy named named Steven RC Hicks and 

39
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,390
his first chapter,
which isn't very long as a good 

40
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,440
introduction to political correctness,
but so well.

41
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:25,860
So why do I think this is about,
about that?

42
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,550
Well,
her.

43
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,190
Here's my reasons.
I mean,

44
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,040
it doesn't seem to be about me.
I think all I did actually was actually.

45
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,220
I made the general specific k,
which is kind of what you have to do if 

46
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,950
you really want to make a point,
a point,

47
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,020
right?
That's one place.

48
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:45,021
If you want to make a point,
and my point was I'm not saying made up 

49
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:48,951
words generated by postmodern Neil 
Marxists because I despise everything 

50
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:54,130
they stand for and so I'm not using 
those damn words and that's that.
