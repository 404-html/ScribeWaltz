1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,950
Is it morally right to bring people into
existence without their consent and 

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,280
knowing that they will inevitably 
intrude suffering during their life?

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,350
Isn't it selfish?
Good question.

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,250
Tolstoy.
I asked that question.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,590
So if you're interested in,
in an answer that question.

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,510
No.
One of the things I would recommend that

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,280
you read that book because that was kind
of history.

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,590
We looked at last thought.
Yeah.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,810
He tells this story.
It's a story about this guy.

10
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:41,340
You told her he's being chased by people
who want to kill him.

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,250
So he jumps into this hole and he's 
hanging on.

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,570
It's like an old whale.
It's hanging on for dear life to this 

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,670
scratching and at the bottom of the hole
there's a crocodile and so he's hanging 

14
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:56,550
on there.
I'm always.

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,630
How you gone?
He noticed this two phase.

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,840
There's some grapes on the vine and then
there's about two mice,

17
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:04,010
one's black and one's white and all of a
sudden they're on.

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,750
You either started buying into chewing 
through it so he knows,

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,220
you know,
and Nick Yoder,

20
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,620
you could fall and get killed or he 
could wait last.

21
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,180
So what do you guys eat?
The grapes,

22
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:21,181
you don't want to.
It's a Buddhist store that was story 

23
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,990
because the white mouse is chaos or 
order in the black house is chaos and 

24
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,500
there's always things working at the 
vitamin B.

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,590
There's no doubt about it.
You know you're screwed no matter what 

26
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,281
you do,
which is the moral of that story and 

27
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:35,281
tolstoy.
He looked at that story and said,

28
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:37,090
look,
the only logical conclusion that you can

29
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:40,120
draw from that is that life is so 
terrible that it shouldn't exist.

30
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,100
And hey,
dusty asked the same question in 

31
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,680
probably is chromosome.
You have this therapy.

32
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,660
It was just smart.
Good wrote being tough guy,

33
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,360
good intellect,
perceptive and yes,

34
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,610
this revenue down the Osha who's kind 
of.

35
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,660
He's a soft guy in some ways.
He's not an intellect,

36
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:07,661
but he's really a good person now.
He was just kind of classically 

37
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,090
religious sneezes.
He wants to be vitiated monastery again.

38
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,710
And I would just talk to the because he 
can blow over with his intellect.

39
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:18,711
You know,
and I can tell us the story about the 

40
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,330
Gospel asked you took from the 
newspaper,

41
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,670
this family,
mother and father,

42
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,810
they were angry at their four year old 
daughter and her house overnight and she

43
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:35,541
was screaming out there using and not 
even basically says to know who's making

44
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:45,811
the case for the goodness of being on 
the goodness of God even says bothered.

45
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,390
How can you bothered?
It's like this is the sort of thing that

46
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:56,370
happens in the world all the time,
and then you ask them what the Osha Law,

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,400
when you willing voluntary torture that 
girl to get to ensure that things would 

48
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,590
continue.
Alicia says,

49
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,130
well,
no,

50
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:08,260
I was doing and what I know you wouldn't
do it.

51
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:13,261
So it's like,
what's your conclusion about that being 

52
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:16,170
shouldn't exist?
And then Girtha asks the same question.

53
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,170
He is a firehouse is character in that 
they,

54
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,180
that the software works and metastases.
This is kind of the intellectual ankle 

55
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,080
of Satan.
That's one way of thinking about it.

56
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,570
And he says the same thing.
He's talking about his motivation.

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,140
He says,
well,

58
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,840
what motivates the great adversary of 
mankind?

59
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,420
Straightforward being so terrible that 
it should be eradicated.

60
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,210
Okay,
fair enough.

61
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,050
Strong people try it.
It's not clear to me that that's where 

62
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:55,330
we should go.
So because as far as I can tell,

63
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:57,550
when people work for the eradication of 
being,

64
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:00,610
it makes everything that they're 
complaining about way worse,

65
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,640
really fast.
And so then the other thing you might 

66
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,040
ask yourself is,
do you think that's the motivation?

67
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,510
It's really so pure heart.
You know they're going to destroy 

68
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,690
mankind to save and they're making a 
judgment.

69
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:16,570
The judgment is being is so terrible 
that it shouldn't exist.

70
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,800
Now,
don't get me wrong,

71
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:20,920
I get the rationale,
the Ivan's rationale.

72
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:23,350
It was never clicked more strongly than 
in the brothers Karamazov.

73
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:24,760
It's a famous passage and writing.

74
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,500
So the question is with regards to 
bringing children into the world,

75
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,630
mom,
it's a variation of the same question.

76
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,920
You know the question is what do you 
have to conclude if you're not willing 

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,011
to do it,
you're completely with bed is not with 

78
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:44,130
the being is not just a particular.
Well that's a hell of a conclusion.

79
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,780
I would be very careful before I made it
because there are places it takes you 

80
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,560
that's not good,
so and then you might also ask yourself,

81
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,590
are you so sure that you're asking that 
question just because you're a good 

82
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,161
person or you may be asking that 
question because you don't want the 

83
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:05,531
response to say,
of having a child in his finger and 

84
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:08,721
said,
or maybe you're afraid that you won't 

85
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:09,460
know how to fortify the child property,
so you're withdrawing the fair.

86
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Fair enough.
Look what do you do with children 

87
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,440
because you encouraged them and I mean 
that literally.

88
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,290
It's like you have a little kid and you 
say,

89
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:25,291
look,
you can take on the world and you don't 

90
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,841
sugarcoat it just like it's not.
It's all fairy tales and roses.

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,200
It's not.
Neil is shield things enough so you 

92
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,561
don't damage them.
It's a very tight balancing because you 

93
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,411
don't want to know what to overwhelmed.
Someone hurt them while you're teaching 

94
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:44,311
them.
You have to expose him gradually and 

95
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:44,311
with intelligence and you do that by 
having a relationship with the kid.

96
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,820
You don't want to shield them from 
existence.

97
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,880
We want to show them just what it's like
and then you want to tell them it 

98
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:50,880
doesn't matter,
man,

99
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:56,010
you're tough enough.
You can do it and you can do it right 

100
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,250
and it's true.
They can and if you see four to five and

101
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:03,251
with that knowledge they are,
they're being is not characterized by 

102
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:08,471
the kind of suffering that makes 
existence intolerable and so the answer 

103
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:09,950
is not to have children.

104
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,980
The answer is cooperative and encourage 
them and that's tough because you don't.

105
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,410
You're kind of fragmented,
been broken,

106
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,690
and if you treat your child,
they might exceed me.

107
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,540
That's annoying.
So you may do everything you can to 

108
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,430
bloody well made sure that your kid is 
broken enough so there's no way they're 

109
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,750
going to do any better than you,
and so I wouldn't recommend that,

110
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,140
but people do it all the time,
but that doesn't mean that existence 

111
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,441
itself is insufficient.
It just means that you're not handling 

112
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:43,110
the property and you're making it far 
worse than it has to be.

113
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,290
In.
One of the things I asked myself a long 

114
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:48,290
time ago,
first of all,

115
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,361
I know there's a distinction between 
tragedy and that's an important 

116
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:55,781
distinction.
Tragedy is when things happen that 

117
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:57,410
aren't good,
someone gets cancer.

118
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,310
You know your child slips and breaks,
his or her labor.

119
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,470
Know your parents guide.
That's tragic.

120
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,410
Evil is when something tragic happens 
because someone wanted it.

121
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,200
Tap.
Okay,

122
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:14,020
so we can distinguish between ell 
students.

123
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,270
The first thing I would say is people 
can have a tragedy like you can get 

124
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,290
tough enough so you can have,
in fact,

125
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:26,291
I think you can get tough enough so that
you even get tougher if you're exposed 

126
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:26,750
to trash.
That sort of his statement about,

127
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,860
you know,
whatever doesn't kill me,

128
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:32,210
makes me stronger.
Obviously it's an overstatement.

129
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,170
It's very hard for people to tolerate 
evil level ones.

130
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,660
So like I've seen people,
for example,

131
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,270
is adolescent clients with posttraumatic
stress disorder.

132
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,300
Very often traumatized by malevolence,
not tragic.

133
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,730
They fall victim to someone who wants to
hurt and maybe it's even self that wants

134
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:51,380
to hurt them and that's revealed to 
them,

135
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,260
you know,
but sometimes they come into their often

136
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:59,261
naive people to come into contact with 
someone whose purpose is to hurt them 

137
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,700
and that shadows so badly to kind of put
themselves back together.

138
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:07,150
Evils really devastated.
I think human beings can tolerate 

139
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,361
tragedy and I also think that if people 
oriented themselves towards the 

140
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:15,971
improvement of being,
we could continually ameliorate tragic 

141
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:19,250
and I do also believe that being is 
striving to perfect itself.

142
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,100
Now that's obviously a metaphysical 
statement,

143
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,800
but I don't really care if it's a 
medical metaphysical statement.

144
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:29,801
I have my reasons for for bleeding and I
think that the purpose of human life is 

145
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:35,960
to participate in that process and 
because again,

146
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:40,961
the alternative is things are quite 
lists and life is suffering and it 

147
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:42,350
should be eradicated.
It's like that leads nowhere.

148
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:44,810
Good really leads nowhere.
Good,

149
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,700
so I can dispense with it.
It's better than where it takes you.

150
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,930
It's like a bad roadmap because most 
profound ideas,

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
our roadmap,
they tell you how to get from one point 

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,891
to another.
Do you want to get to the depths of 

153
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:03,111
infertile chaos or do you want to move 
towards something that approximates 

154
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:03,930
paradise?

155
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Well,
he better make sure you have the right 

156
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,530
map and so and most belief systems,
our roadmaps,

157
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,320
they're descriptions of reality in our 
description to objective reality there.

158
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,280
That isn't what they are,
so have kids to say,

159
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,360
it's one third of your life.
You will bloody won't regret it if you 

160
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,720
don't do it.
You're not going to be forever or 30.

161
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,130
Some days you're going to be 50 or 55 
and maybe it will be alone.

162
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,660
That's not so good and so you're a fool 
if you don't have kids.

163
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,140
Now,
I mean,

164
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,680
I know people have their reasons and 
some people have appropriate reasons and

165
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:42,681
all that,
but if it's somebody ideological hangup 

166
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:44,830
that stopping you,
if you better dispense with that 

167
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,030
instead,
instead of dispensing with the kids.
