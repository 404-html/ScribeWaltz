1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,810
I'll tell you a little story.
This is in my book,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,470
so I had this landlord in Montreal.
He lived next door to me and he was an 

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,801
ex hell's angels biker.
He'd spent a lot of time in prison and 

4
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:16,581
his wife had borderline personality 
disorder and she committed suicide when 

5
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:20,271
I lived there and was a rough guy and he
was at Caa Quebec law and he spoke to 

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,170
you all,
which I could hardly understand.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,530
And uh,
he didn't really know what to make of me

8
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,000
and I didn't really know what to make of
him,

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,510
but we got along,
you know,

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,140
and I was very careful talking to him 
as,

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,990
as you might imagine,
but,

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,000
but I,
I was,

13
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:41,001
it was very.
And we went over to my wife and I went 

14
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:43,311
over there and we had a spaghetti dinner
one night and we sort of communicated 

15
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:46,761
and I bought a poster from him because 
he made these wooden posters that had 

16
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:46,761
neon on them.

17
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:50,480
And that's how we made a living.
He'd Kinda trained himself to be a bit 

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,211
of an electronics guy.
And so we made these things and he was 

19
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:53,211
trying to quit drinking and we talked 
about that.

20
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:54,870
He was a lot older than me.
He was like 20 years older than me.

21
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:57,480
I was about 25 at this point.
And uh,

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,010
we got along pretty well.
But every now and then he'd go out and 

23
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,850
get a drink and he could really drink,
you know,

24
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:08,910
like he was one of these guys who could 
drink like 60 beer and you think,

25
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:11,010
well no one can drink that much and 
you're wrong.

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,210
I studied alcohol for like 10 years,
some of my subjects,

27
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:20,211
father's drank 40 ounces of vodka a day 
and had been doing it for 20 years so 

28
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:21,270
you can drink a lot and he could drink a
lot.

29
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,860
And what would happen?
He was trying to,

30
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:27,861
not drink,
but he'd go out and go on a binge and 

31
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:28,920
then he'd be gone for like three days 
and he drink up all his money.

32
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,250
And then we'd hear him out in the 
backyard howling at the moon with this 

33
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,730
little little ugly dog he had,
you know,

34
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,580
and he'd hold him,
the dog would hell.

35
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:40,480
And he'd haul them and the dog would 
haul and,

36
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,770
and it was a rather unsettling and made 
my wife nervous and what worse,

37
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,810
you know now,
and then he'd come to the door like 

38
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:53,810
three in the morning,
hey,

39
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,190
and he'd knock on the door and he'd be 
standing there and I don't know how much

40
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:02,070
experience you've had with rough guys 
who are alcoholic and who are drunk,

41
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:07,071
but it's,
they can be upright and unconscious at 

42
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:13,851
the same time.
And so that was the state that he was 

43
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:13,851
in,
you know,

44
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:16,660
he'd be just swaying and he'd asked me 
if I would like to buy his toaster or 

45
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,620
his microwave because he needed some 
money to keep drinking.

46
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:24,621
And you know,
I didn't really want to buy his toaster 

47
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:25,620
or as microwave.
But when the x hell's angel,

48
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,850
you all speaking 60 beard,
drunk Quebecois biker shows up at your 

49
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,661
door at three in the morning.
And the offers you to sell offers to 

50
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:39,081
sell you his microwave.
The easiest thing is to say I really 

51
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:39,630
need a microwave.

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,050
So,
so you know,

53
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:50,820
I bought the microwave and toaster and 
some other things.

54
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,690
But then,
but then my wife talked to me and she 

55
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,440
liked my landlord,
you know,

56
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,690
even though she was afraid of him,
she liked him and she said,

57
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,720
you can't buy any more,
any more appliances because it's not 

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,930
good for him.
And I thought,

59
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,380
Huh,
that's an interesting problem.

60
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,790
So what the hell am I going to do about 
this because no,

61
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,850
I don't want to buy your microwave just 
doesn't seem to be the right answer at 

62
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:21,850
three in the morning.
So.

63
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,720
So one time he took me out on his 7:50
Honda and he put me on the back of it.

64
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,910
He wanted to show me his layer,
I guess his hangouts and I got his 

65
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,271
wife's helmet on but it didn't fit it 
just sit on the top of my head and he 

66
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:40,220
said,
I go to the bike and he said if the cops

67
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,230
chase us,
we're not stopping.

68
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,550
And then away we went and we went to 
these,

69
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:49,160
like these bars downtown on south of the
road.

70
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,970
They were very rough places and he got 
into like four fights that night because

71
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,470
he was a rough guy,
you know.

72
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:59,471
And these kind of punk guys would come 
up to them and sort of challenge them 

73
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:03,101
and act stupidly around him and he was 
very skeptical and if you were acting 

74
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:03,710
stupidly around him for any length of 
time,

75
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:06,560
he just hit you because he felt that 
that's what you deserved.

76
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:08,490
And perhaps he was right,
you know,

77
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,510
so.
So I had a firsthand opportunity to 

78
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:13,580
observe him.
So anyways,

79
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:18,581
he sure enough,
about a week or two after we had this 

80
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:19,310
conversation,
he showed up at the door,

81
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,000
knock,
knock,

82
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:20,810
knock,
you know,

83
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,180
opened the door and they're standing 
there with his eyes half closed and he 

84
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,011
was swaying and he had,
I don't remember what the appliance was 

85
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,731
this time,
but he wanted to sell it to me and I 

86
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,160
said,
I'm not all I can buy this.

87
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,880
I'm not going to buy this because I know
you're trying to quit drinking.

88
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,830
And if I give you this money then you're
going to go and drink it up and it's not

89
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:48,670
going to be good for you.
And what else did I tell him?

90
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,130
I think I told him as well that this 
whole thing of him coming to my house at

91
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:59,131
like two in the morning was scaring my 
wife who we liked and that it had to 

92
00:04:59,131 --> 00:04:59,770
stop and believe me,
man.

93
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:05,010
I was thinking about what I was saying 
because he was watching me like a rough 

94
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,380
guy watches you and a rough guy watches 
you like this.

95
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,480
He thinks if you say one thing that 
indicates contempt,

96
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,610
you're going to bloody well pay for it.
And so I was finding my words like,

97
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,060
you know,
I was crossing a swamp and trying to 

98
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,060
look for the,
for the rocks underneath the surface.

99
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,070
And I said what I had to say very,
very carefully.

100
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,340
And he looked at me for about 15 seconds
and that's a long time to be looked at 

101
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,310
at three in the morning.
And he left and he never came back to 

102
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:42,340
sell me anything again.
And we got along fine.

103
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,090
But that's a good illustration of this 
issue with regards to truth and success 

104
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,940
in the strange land.
Because I was in the strange land when I

105
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:59,941
was talking to my neighbor,
my landlord Dan and I managed to say 

106
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,690
what was true carefully enough so 
despite the fact that he was a very 

107
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,131
violent person and that he was very 
intoxicated person and then he had every

108
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:17,441
reason to be suspicious of me and we 
couldn't communicate very well and I 

109
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:21,641
didn't do what he wanted,
that he took it and he left and there 

110
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:26,900
was no problem and life went on just 
fine after that,

111
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,800
and so we don't want to underestimate 
the utility of establishing this bounded

112
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:40,091
relationship with the ideal and 
attempting to live with some nobility in

113
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:45,230
truth while aiming at the highest ideal.
There's nothing about that.

114
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,650
That's anything but strengthening and 
positive and it's exactly what you need 

115
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,250
to set against the catastrophe and 
uncertainty of life.
