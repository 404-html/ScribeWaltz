1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,490
I've dealt with lots of people who have 
anxiety disorders,

2
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:07,491
you know,
and one thing about people who have 

3
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:07,491
anxiety disorders is they are not 
mysterious to me.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,730
I understand.
It's no problem for me to understand why

5
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:16,731
people have anxiety disorders or why 
they're depressed or why they have 

6
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:19,200
substance use problems.
The mystery to me is always white people

7
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:24,201
don't have all of those things at once 
because everybody has a reason to be 

8
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:24,420
anxious.
In fact,

9
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:29,421
we have the ultimate reason to be 
anxious because we know that we're 

10
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:32,601
vulnerable and we know that we're going 
to die and how you can not be anxious 

11
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:33,780
under those circumstances is a great 
mystery.

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,130
It's a massive mystery and that same 
thing applies with regards to depression

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,580
and then the same thing applies to some 
degree with regards to drug and alcohol 

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:43,580
abuse.
As I said last week,

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,830
there's plenty of reasons to drown your 
consciousness and alcohol.

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,860
That's for sure.
We could refer to the aforementioned 

17
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,441
anxiety and depression not least and so 
and the and the sorts of drugs that 

18
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:59,871
people are prone to take our chemicals 
that take the effect of edge off the 

19
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:01,500
tragedy of life.
So,

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,830
so back to back to the issue of of of 
fear.

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,540
Being Abraham is self conscious.
That's what this commentary says,

22
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,760
but the thing is as he moves forward,
despite that,

23
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:16,620
he's self conscious and he knows the 
danger,

24
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:21,000
but he moves forward despite that and 
that's actually the appropriate response

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,380
in the face of actual non naive 
understanding of what constitutes life.

26
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:26,970
Like if you're naive and you move 
forward,

27
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:27,450
it's like,
well,

28
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:32,451
what the hell do you know?
You know there's no courage in naivety 

29
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:33,810
because you don't know what there is to 
stop you.

30
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:35,610
You don't know what dangers you might 
apprehend,

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,780
but to be aware of what it is that your 
problem is.

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,150
So to be alert existentially,
let's say,

33
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:47,151
or to be fully self conscious means that
you're perfectly aware of your 

34
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:50,481
limitations and how you might be hurt 
and then to make the decision to move 

35
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:51,510
forward into the unknown and the land of
the stranger.

36
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,710
Anyways,
that's the.

37
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,890
I would say that's one of the secrets to
a good life and I can say that really 

38
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,410
without fear of contradiction,
I would I would say because the clinical

39
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,120
literature on this is very,
very,

40
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:08,121
very clear.
What you do with people who are afraid 

41
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:08,940
and to some degree depressed but 
certainly anxious,

42
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:11,490
is you lay out what what they're anxious
about,

43
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:14,490
first of all in detail.
What is it that you're afraid of?

44
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:19,491
What might happen,
and then you decompose it into small 

45
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:19,950
problems,
hypothetically,

46
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:24,951
manageable problems,
and then you have the person expose 

47
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:25,440
themselves to the thing that they're 
afraid of.

48
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,170
And what happens isn't that they get 
less afraid.

49
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:30,750
That isn't what the clinical literature 
indicates.

50
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:35,751
Exactly.
What happens instead is they get braver 

51
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:35,751
and that's not the same thing,
right?

52
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,110
Because if it get less afraid,
it's like,

53
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,170
well,
the world isn't as dangerous as I 

54
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,170
thought it was.
You know,

55
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,170
silly me.
If you get braver,

56
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,230
that's not what happens.
What happens is,

57
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:48,231
yeah,
the World Damn worlds just as dangerous 

58
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:48,231
as I thought,
or maybe it's even more dangerous than I

59
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:52,641
thought,
but it turns out that there's something 

60
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:54,681
in me that responds to taking that on as
a voluntary challenge and grows and 

61
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:56,990
thrives as a consequence,
and there's no doubt about this.

62
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,640
Even the psychophysiological findings 
are quite clear if you,

63
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,600
if you can,
if you impose a stressor on two groups 

64
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,011
of people and on one group the stressor 
is imposed involuntarily and on the 

65
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:14,020
other group,
the stressor is picked up voluntarily.

66
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,200
The people who pick up the stress or 
voluntary voluntarily use a whole 

67
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,230
different cycle physiological system to 
deal with it.

68
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,500
They use the system that's associated 
with approach and challenge and not the 

69
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,221
system that's a pro associated with 
defensive aggression and withdrawal and 

70
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:31,110
the system that is associated with 
challenges,

71
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,120
much more associated with positive 
emotion and much less associated with 

72
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,991
negative emotion.
It's also much less hard on you because 

73
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:41,800
the defensive posturing system,
the prey animal system,

74
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,270
man,
when that thing kicks in,

75
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:48,271
it's all systems are go for you.
You know you're the gas is pushed down 

76
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:52,531
to the pedal,
is pushed down to the metal and the 

77
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:54,631
brakes are on.
You're using future resources that you 

78
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,050
could be storing for future time right 
now in the present to ready yourself for

79
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,590
emergency.
So there's,

80
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,180
there's,
there's nothing simple or trivial at all

81
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:06,181
about the idea of being called to move 
forthrightly forward into this strange 

82
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:09,370
and the unknown and there's a real 
adventure that's associated with that,

83
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:09,640
right?

84
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,850
So that's an exciting thing,
which is part of the reason why people 

85
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,611
travel.
And then also to see yourself as the 

86
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:20,191
sort of creature that can do that is 
willing to do that on a habitual basis 

87
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:23,980
is also the right kind of tonic for.
I hate this word for yourself.

88
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:25,480
Esteem,
you know,

89
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,840
because the self esteem has nothing to 
do with feeling good about yourself.

90
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,100
As a,
as I already mentioned,

91
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,160
there isn't necessarily reason why a 
priority.

92
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,930
You should just feel good about 
yourself,

93
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:39,931
but if you can view yourself acting in a
courageous and forthright manner and 

94
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:44,761
encountering the world and trying to 
improve your lot and and and taking 

95
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:44,770
risks,
you know,

96
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,800
in a non naive way,
well then you have something that you 

97
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,291
can comfort yourself with at night when 
you're wondering what the whole damn 

98
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:56,281
point out of your few tiled and 
miserable life and so and that's 

99
00:04:56,281 --> 00:05:01,141
necessary because it's often the case 
that you wake up at four in the morning 

100
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:05,521
or at least sometimes the case that you 
wake up at four in the morning when 

101
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:08,491
things haven't been going that well and 
wonder just what the hell the point is 

102
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:08,650
of your futile and miserable life.

103
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,770
You have to have something real to set 
against that.

104
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:16,771
It can't be just rationalizations about 
how you know you're a valuable person 

105
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:17,710
among others.
Even though that's true,

106
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:22,711
that's not good enough.
You need something that's more 

107
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:25,591
realistic.
To set a against that and observing 

108
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,560
courage in yourself is definitely one of
the things that that that could help you

109
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,070
sleep soundly at night.
When,

110
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,710
when things are destabilized a little 
bit around you.
