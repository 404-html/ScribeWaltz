1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,470
I don't want to calculate high 
resolution utopia for myself,

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:09,471
only to have it squandered by fortune.
How do I ensure the meaning I 

3
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:10,410
experienced this self determined?
Well,

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,550
you can't because there's an arbitrary 
element to existence,

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:18,000
so it is going to be squandered to some 
degree by fortune,

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,650
but that's.
That's not the point.

7
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:24,651
What are you going to do?
Just sit back on your laurels and wait 

8
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:24,651
for things to roll over you,
so what you do.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,660
Look,
the hero myth basically says,

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,290
go out there,
confront the drag and get the gold.

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,370
Share it with the community and and and 
live properly,

12
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:38,520
or it says,
the alternative is faced the tyrant.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,920
Enter the desert as a consequence 
because everything falls apart.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,570
Recast,
structure,

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,600
find the promise land.
Those are the two elements to the hero 

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,470
myth and you might and that's divine.
It's the closest thing to divine that we

17
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:53,700
know.
You might say,

18
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:58,701
well,
what happens if you follow the divine 

19
00:00:58,701 --> 00:00:58,890
path and then so it might be,
well,

20
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:02,010
everything turns out perfectly because 
God is on your side.

21
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:02,790
It's like,
no,

22
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,540
that isn't what happened because things 
don't turn out perfectly.

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,080
It's your best bet.
It's your best strategy,

24
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,030
right?
That's the thing,

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,480
and you know,
dragons wouldn't be dragons if they 

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,780
couldn't eat you and so,
but that's okay.

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,840
That's okay.
And this is something I found so useful 

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,361
about the biblical stories,
posts especially about the abrahamic 

29
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:26,820
stories which I didn't know that well 
until I lectured about them last year.

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,120
You know,
God calls people to the adventure of 

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,120
their lives and so you could say in 
part,

32
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,060
God is that force within you which calls
you to the adventure of your life,

33
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:37,680
and it says,
get away from your family.

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,860
Get away from your blind and unconscious
comfort and get the hell out there in 

35
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:42,860
the world.
Well,

36
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,811
God calls Abraham out from his father's 
where he stayed far too long and from 

37
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:50,400
his kin where it's secure and like the 
first thing he encounters is a famine,

38
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,550
and then he encounters a tyranny 
inhabited by people who want to steal 

39
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:55,550
his wife.
It's like you think,

40
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,910
well,
he ever happened.

41
00:01:56,911 --> 00:02:00,120
Should have just stayed in bed and 
ignored God obviously.

42
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,950
Well,
that isn't how it is.

43
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:04,830
It's like we're built for struggle.
US human beings.

44
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:10,140
You're not after the bubbles of bliss 
that does Tsq described in,

45
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,260
in notes from underground.
We're built to contend with the world.

46
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:18,261
We're built to contend with reality.
You want to challenge and the best way 

47
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:21,120
that you can take on a challenge because
the challenge fortifies you so you don't

48
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:21,780
want to be secure.

49
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,780
You want to be strong and you get strong
by taking on optimal challenges and so 

50
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,071
you lay out your destiny in the world 
and you take the slings and arrows of 

51
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:33,090
fate and you make yourself stronger 
while you're doing so and you might fail

52
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,140
and fortunate might do you in,
but it's your best bet and you know 

53
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,290
people have also people that have 
extracted unbelievable successes out of 

54
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:47,190
catastrophic failures and so,
and I'm not saying that in a naive way.

55
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:49,170
I know perfectly well what happens to 
people.

56
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,200
You know you're doing fine in life and 
then you get cancer and then six months 

57
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,711
later your debt and all the heroism in 
the world isn't going to save you at 

58
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,260
that point,
but that's not the point.

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,230
That's not the point.
Life is bounded by mortality,

60
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,410
but that doesn't mean that you don't get
out there and content and you develop by

61
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:11,411
contending and you minimize the net 
amount of suffering in the world and 

62
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:11,411
that's something,
man,

63
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:15,880
that's something to do so it's,
it's it beats laying in your basement,

64
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:20,140
getting bitter and then doing the 
terrible things that bitter people do so

65
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,160
you can't ensure that the meaning you 
experienced yourself determined,

66
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:29,161
but you can play your role to the best 
of your ability and that will be good 

67
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:31,780
enough and that will be good enough.

68
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,200
That meaning the meaning that you'll 
find in then in that I believe is 

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,400
sufficient to be sustaining and perhaps 
even sustaining through the flood.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,730
So it isn't that you can avoid 
catastrophe,

71
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:50,230
it's that you can prepare yourself to 
deal with it honorably when it arrives.

72
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,340
That's what you've got.
