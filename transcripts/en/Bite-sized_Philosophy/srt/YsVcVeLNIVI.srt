1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,210
Mother made some pancakes for billy 
about the dragon,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,900
ate the mall,
mother made some more,

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,020
but the dragon eight,
those two mother kept making pancakes 

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,790
until she ran out of batter.
Billy only got one of them,

5
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,890
but he said that's all he really wanted.
Anyway,

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,000
so I'll tell you another story about 
that.

7
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:25,650
So when I lived in Boston,
I had little kids and uh,

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,060
my wife took care of some neighborhood 
little kids because she didn't have a 

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,460
green card and that was,
she was home with the kids anyways.

10
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:35,640
And anyway,
she took care of some other little kids.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,070
One of them would only eat hot dogs.
That was quite funny.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,790
You'd only eat hotdogs at his mother's 
place booked at our house.

13
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,100
He ate all of his lunch and he was 
perfectly happy about it.

14
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:46,320
So I thought that was quite amusing too.
But anyways,

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,640
one day a neighbor came by and the 
neighbor had a four year old child and 

16
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,840
the neighbor was looking for someone to 
take care of the child because her nanny

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,230
had been in a car accident and couldn't 
take care of the child temporarily.

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,230
So the child had sort of been 
circulating around neighborhood houses 

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,380
for a couple of days and you know,
people were taking care of him,

20
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:10,410
then he ended up at our house and um,
which was fine.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,300
And so he's a cute little guy and uh,
his,

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,400
the mother came to the door and she said
she's,

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,150
you know,
pushed the boy and he was Kinda like,

24
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:23,340
this wasn't very happy.
And um,

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,230
she said he probably won't eat all day,
but that's okay.

26
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,290
And I thought,
hmm,

27
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:36,291
that's a,
that's a remarkably interesting 

28
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:36,291
statement to,
you know,

29
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:40,310
to,
to put forth as a proposition the first 

30
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,240
time we meet your son,
it's like he won't eat all day,

31
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,270
which by the way is not okay,
it's not okay and you're going to tell 

32
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,201
us that it's okay and you're going to 
expect that we're just going to accept 

33
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:51,300
the fact that you think it's okay.

34
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,890
And that's,
that's the whole story.

35
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:55,620
You deliver all that information in one 
little sentence.

36
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,490
So I thought,
well,

37
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,550
that's pretty damn peculiar.
Uh,

38
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,350
I believe she was a psychologist too,
which was quite interesting.

39
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,610
So.
Okay,

40
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:07,611
so that's fine.
So I went out to do something and there 

41
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:11,271
was four kids playing in the house and 
when I came back the little guy was in 

42
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:14,631
the porch,
like wear the boots were at everything 

43
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:15,540
and he was sort of standing there like 
this and I thought,

44
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,600
hmm,
that's not good because there's all 

45
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,401
these other kids.
Like he should've been in there playing 

46
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:23,280
a lot obviously that that's what a child
is primed to do.

47
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,190
He should've been in there messing about
with,

48
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:31,191
I think there was a two year old,
a three year old and another four year 

49
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:31,191
old.
He should've been in there,

50
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:34,540
you know,
causing trouble and having fun and 

51
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:34,540
playing.

52
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,100
But he wasn't,
he was standing in the porch like this 

53
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,100
and he wasn't happy.
He wasn't happy.

54
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,930
So I looked at him for a bit and then I 
poked him a couple of times because I 

55
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:41,930
thought,
you know,

56
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,130
if you're interacting with little kids,
they're very playful a,

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,260
they're kind of like puppies.
And so if you,

58
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,570
if you tease them a bit and tickled them
a bit,

59
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,810
then usually even if they're crabby,
you know,

60
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,910
a smile break out that despite their 
best efforts and then they'll sort of 

61
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,420
giggle then maybe you know,
they'll try to whack you away and they,

62
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:57,880
you know,
they,

63
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,260
they go into a play routine and although
you may not know it,

64
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,610
mammals like us have a place circuit in 
also.

65
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:11,611
So we're intrinsically playful,
which is partly why we can get along 

66
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:14,401
with dogs because of course dogs are 
intrinsically playful and most people 

67
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:14,800
know how to play with the dog and you 
know,

68
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:16,240
when a dog wants to play,
right?

69
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,110
Because it sort of puts his paws down 
and looks up at you and Sorta grants and

70
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:22,060
puts its tail in the air and goes like 
dance.

71
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:24,700
It's like clue in primate,
you know,

72
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,940
it's time to engage in some playing and 
you know,

73
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,030
you basically know how to do that.
And even the dog knows how to do that.

74
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:34,210
So I'm poking this kid and trying to get
them to smile,

75
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:35,710
but there's no damn way,
you know,

76
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:40,711
I'm poking him.
He's just ignoring me like mad and I 

77
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:40,711
thought,
that's not good,

78
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:44,791
you know,
because you don't want your four year 

79
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:44,791
old to have learned that you should.
You should,

80
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:49,440
that it's okay to ignore adults or that 
you should ignore adults or that you can

81
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:54,631
ignore adults.
That's all bad because the world's full 

82
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:57,901
of adults and they know a lot of things 
and they control all the resources and 

83
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:58,030
so you better get along with them.

84
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,160
Plus you're going to end up as an adult 
for most of your life.

85
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,420
So if the general,
you know,

86
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:08,680
if the first rule is adults can and 
should be ignored,

87
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,590
then what the hell are you headed for?
You know,

88
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,770
and it's one of the reasons that it's 
really useful to made sure the children 

89
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,740
respect adults because they're going to 
be adults.

90
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,980
So if they don't respect adults,
then of course they don't have any 

91
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,680
respect for what they're going to be.
Why the hell grow up?

92
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,700
You end up like Peter Pan Because that's
what Peter Parents about,

93
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:32,701
right?
Peter Pan Wants to stay at Neverland 

94
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:34,540
with the lost boys were where there's no
responsibility because you know,

95
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,690
he looks at the future and only sees his
captain hook a tyrant who's afraid of 

96
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,120
death.
That's the crocodile,

97
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:45,121
right?
It's chasing him with a clock in its 

98
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:45,121
stomach.
And it's the same thing as this dragon.

99
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,970
So,
you know,

100
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,920
kids have to respect adults.
It's,

101
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,750
you're doing them a disservice if they 
don't.

102
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,400
So okay,
so fine.

103
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:53,260
I'm poking this kid.
There's just no damn way.

104
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:55,360
I'm not getting anywhere with them and I
thought this isn't good.

105
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,670
There's something deeply wrong with this
little kid,

106
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,210
so that's fine.
So then we said all the kids down for 

107
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,481
lunch and the rule is your damn lunch 
and be thankful for it because you think

108
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:12,241
about this.
Leonard Cohen wrote this song once 

109
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:12,241
about,
I don't remember the song particularly,

110
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:15,610
but he talked about the homicidal 
bitching that goes down in every kitchen

111
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:17,740
about who is going to serve and who's 
going to eat.

112
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,920
It's like if you haven't encountered 
that,

113
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,960
then there's something terribly wrong.
You know,

114
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,060
so because a lot of the tension in in 
households is domestic tension,

115
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,550
the tension between husbands and wives 
or husbands,

116
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:31,570
wives and children.

117
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,570
It's like just who the hell is going to 
do the domestic duties and how and when 

118
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,510
and the answer can't be,
well,

119
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,610
we're not going to do them because then 
you know,

120
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:42,190
you eat cheetos and popcorn and you 
know,

121
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,620
for the rest of your life and that's not
good.

122
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:49,621
It's gotten to the point in England 
because the domestic situations have 

123
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:53,461
deteriorated.
The rituals have deteriorated to such a 

124
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:56,041
point that about one slash third of 
families no longer have a dining room 

125
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,250
table and you can buy precooked hard 
boiled eggs.

126
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,870
Yeah,
yeah.

127
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:00,790
Right.
You know,

128
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,890
it's not a good thing.
And you might ask yourself why the hell 

129
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,290
everyone is either fat or has an eating 
disorder.

130
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,860
And you know,
part of the reason is,

131
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:12,861
is that the entire domestic routine 
around regulating food intake has 

132
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:16,931
disappeared.
And that's a terrible thing for people 

133
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:16,931
because we're social eaters.

134
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:21,790
So you might say,
well if you sit down with a bunch of 

135
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,730
other people at a table,
how much should you eat?

136
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,500
And the answer is you should eat on 
average what everyone else eats.

137
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,500
And that's exactly what you do.
Even if you don't notice it,

138
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,440
you know,
people are so wired into.

139
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,240
We did experiments like this.
If you,

140
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:38,990
if you bring on have you bring 
undergraduates who don't know each other

141
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:43,991
into a lab and you give them a snack 
while they're doing something like 

142
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:45,890
watching a movie,
they will eat the same number of chips.

143
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,430
So you know,
if one of the meets the whole half the 

144
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,731
thing,
the other real you'd have if one only 

145
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:54,731
has one,
the other only have one.

146
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:57,800
The correlation between the food intake 
between the dyads was about point eight.

147
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,040
It was staggering.
It seemed to be a little higher for 

148
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,531
extroverts than for introverts,
but it was remarkably remarkably can 

149
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:06,170
coordinate and you can understand why,
right?

150
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:11,170
Because human being shared food,
it's like you are not going to be a 

151
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,860
popular tribes person if you eat,
you know,

152
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,740
30 percent of the food when food is in 
short supply,

153
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,070
you better be bloody awake and make sure
that you don't take more than your share

154
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,250
and you know,
it's a fundamental element of human 

155
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:24,250
nature to do that.
And,

156
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,520
and we also regulate our sense of 
satiety by cues that are external to us.

157
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,720
So regulating our food intake also 
because we're omnivores,

158
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:35,630
turns out to be a tremendously difficult
thing and well,

159
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,640
anyways,
back to this kid.

160
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,700
So we bring all the kids to the table 
and they're sitting around in there 

161
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,010
having lunch and the rule is,
as I said,

162
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,940
eat what is in front of you and be 
pleased and happy about it.

163
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:52,100
So you might say,
well why would that also be a rule?

164
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,820
It's like,
okay,

165
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,810
put yourself in this position now 
because you'll be in this position.

166
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,610
You're going to cook your damn kids some
lunch and you're going to do that.

167
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,210
Well,
let's,

168
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,940
let's calculate it out because I like 
doing arithmetic.

169
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,980
So let's say it takes you half an hour a
day and you do it seven days a week,

170
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:12,140
but we'll multiply that by three because
there's three meals.

171
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:13,730
So it's an hour and a half a day,
right?

172
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,080
So okay,
fine.

173
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:17,330
Seven times an hour and a half is 
roughly 10.

174
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,150
So it's 10 hours a week.
It's 40 hours a month,

175
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:22,130
right?
Forty hours a month is a full work week.

176
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,510
So 40 hours a month times 12,
12 full work weeks,

177
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:28,010
right?
Yes.

178
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,070
That's three full months of 40 hour days
of cooking something for your damn kid.

179
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,890
Now that's a lot of time and then you're
going to do that for 18 years.

180
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,100
So then you might ask yourself what sort
of response do you need from your child 

181
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,120
in order to not feel resentful and 
miserable about the fact that you have 

182
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,961
to do that for three bloody months this 
year and you just have to think about 

183
00:08:52,961 --> 00:08:56,790
this and this is also why it's necessary
to know inside yourself.

184
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,060
You carry a monster just like the world 
outside you carries a monster.

185
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Do not think that you're going to be 
able to maintain a healthy attitude 

186
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,770
towards your child or towards food or 
towards yourself.

187
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,040
If all you can muster up for the effort 
of cooking and preparing food is the 

188
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,151
attitude of a slave and continual 
punishment from the people that you're 

189
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:17,400
offering food too.
It's like,

190
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:22,401
who the hell wants that?
So you want to teach them miserable 

191
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:25,641
little bladder that he's lucky that 
there's any food there at all and that 

192
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:29,481
the proper attitude is to say,
really thank you very much mom or thank 

193
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:33,021
you very much dad.
I'm glad that you produce something and 

194
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:33,090
then you know,
you can be all happy about the fact that

195
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:36,360
you were slaving away in the kitchen and
you can like your kid.

196
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,920
So,
and you know,

197
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,750
you might think,
well everybody likes their kids.

198
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,320
It's like,
yeah,

199
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:43,020
right.
No that's not true.

200
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,340
That's not true.
And now,

201
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:44,860
and then,
you know,

202
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,710
you read in the newspaper about someone 
who's,

203
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,950
you know,
being pushed a little bit too far on 

204
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,470
some day that they're unemployed and 
hung over and you know,

205
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:57,471
the relationship is just broken up and 
they do something absolutely brutal to 

206
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:57,471
their child.
And you think,

207
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:57,990
well,
how could anyone do that?

208
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:03,020
It's like there's a lot of history of 
terrible interactions between the mother

209
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:08,421
and the child or the father and the 
child before something like that 

210
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:08,421
happens.
So,

211
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:11,901
you know,
if you want to protect your child 

212
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:13,431
against the beast that's inside you,
you might want to teach them to treat 

213
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:15,690
you with some respect so that you're 
much more likely to be a civilized human

214
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:17,340
being around them.
So,

215
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,030
all right,
so anyways,

216
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:22,620
so this kid sit in there and there's no 
damn way he's going to eat anything.

217
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,300
So we decide we're going to feed him,
which I'm an expert at because my,

218
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,460
my son.
And the one who said no all the time,

219
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,350
he was the most stubborn little custom 
you could possibly imagine.

220
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:34,800
And one time when he was about nine 
months old,

221
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,700
he got ahold of the spoon and it was 
like he was not going to be fat anymore.

222
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:39,690
Hey.
So that's fine.

223
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:40,170
Good.
You know,

224
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:44,040
it's like feed yourself,
but no kids say they're too damn curious

225
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:49,041
and playful really to feed themselves.
So you sit them in a high chair and 

226
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:49,041
then,
you know,

227
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,880
they fling the food onto the floor 
because that's pretty cool.

228
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,060
They could watch that over and over in 
order they mess around with it or maybe 

229
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,060
they,
you know,

230
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,850
put some in mum's hair because that's 
interesting too.

231
00:10:57,851 --> 00:11:02,851
And they have two or three bites and 
then they're not ravenous and then 

232
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:05,661
they're much more interested in playing 
and that's fine except that kid does 

233
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:05,661
need.

234
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:08,190
Then it gets crabby and you know,
whiny and miserable.

235
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:13,191
And then it just disturbs the mother or 
the father and then it won't sleep at 

236
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:13,191
night.
It's like,

237
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:15,270
that's no good.
So after about three days of that,

238
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:20,271
I took the spoon back from him and he 
was not happy about that man trying to 

239
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:21,750
get that little kid to eat.
Once I got the spoon,

240
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:24,900
it was like a four hour battle.
It was really remarkable.

241
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,220
So I,
I,

242
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:26,800
I,
I,

243
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:31,410
a lot of respect for his ability to 
withstand stubbornness,

244
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:36,411
you know,
but I had learned by that time as a 

245
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:36,411
parent that like if you want to 
discipline your child,

246
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:37,860
you,
there's an attitude you have to take,

247
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:42,210
which is I am going to win this.
Like I don't care how stubborn you are,

248
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,870
I am going to win.
And because I know I'm going to win,

249
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,980
I'm not going to get angry.

250
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,100
I'm just gonna out stubborn you.
And so.

251
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,020
So I take up some food and put it in 
front of him.

252
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,910
He'd go like this.
So that was a good trick.

253
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:00,440
And so I try to get the food in there 
and his teeth regretted.

254
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,820
So I poke,
poke,

255
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:04,300
poke,
poke,

256
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,890
poke.
And after about 10 pokes,

257
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,790
he'd get annoyed and go and I put the 
food yet then he tried to spit it out.

258
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:10,900
So I'd hold it,
the editing this.

259
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:12,880
So then.
So that was like three minutes,

260
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,680
you know,
and then we did it with another spoonful

261
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:15,940
and you know,
after about,

262
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,900
I'd say an hour of this,
my wife had to leave because it was like

263
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,720
she just couldn't handle it and I bought
an hour after this he decided that,

264
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,740
you know,
it was okayed and then he would let me 

265
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,151
feed them.
But like it was brutal and it was 

266
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:30,151
amazing.

267
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:31,670
I mean little kids are so damn tough,
you know,

268
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,690
they're really cute and everything and,
but they're so tough you just can't 

269
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:36,690
believe it.
So anyways.

270
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,780
So we had this good at the table and he 
was not going to eat.

271
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,550
So my wife who'd learned these tricks by
this time decided to feed him and he had

272
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:50,551
a lot of sort of nine months old or 
eight month old behaviors because you 

273
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:54,841
don't.
Kids have different strategies of 

274
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,521
resistance if they don't want to do 
something and those strategies get more 

275
00:12:56,521 --> 00:12:57,190
sophisticated as they get older.
But.

276
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,680
And he had some strategies but they 
weren't sophisticated,

277
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,870
you know,
like he didn't make jokes or knocked the

278
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:04,240
spoon away or,
or get angry or,

279
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,570
or run away or any of those things.
He did kind of nine months old things,

280
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:11,140
which means he just put his head down 
and when she put the spoon towards him,

281
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,450
he just covered his head one way or 
another.

282
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,540
So.
So that was interesting because I knew 

283
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,051
that his parents had given up feeding 
him when he was about eight or nine 

284
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,901
months old because those tricks worked.
And so that's why she could come to the 

285
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:24,901
house and say he probably won't eat all 
day,

286
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:26,740
but that's all right.
Which it isn't,

287
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,400
it's not all right.
So fine.

288
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:35,401
So my wife is trying to feed him and he 
doesn't open his mouth so she pokes him 

289
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:35,490
a bit and sooner or later he gets mad 
and you know,

290
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,080
goes and she puts the food in and she 
does.

291
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,500
And then she pats him on the head as 
soon as he swallows it and says,

292
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,790
look,
you're being a really good kid.

293
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,990
You know,
you're doing a good job.

294
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,660
And then,
so he's wondering what the hell is going

295
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:51,661
on.
And then it was so interesting because 

296
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:51,661
she kept feeding him and he was still 
doing this,

297
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,700
but as she patted them on the head,
he'd be doing this and he'd open his 

298
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:56,700
mouth.

299
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,020
So it was like there was this weird 
conflict between his habitual behavior 

300
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,720
and this thing that was being 
reinforced.

301
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:04,540
So then she put food in and pat him and 
he,

302
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,250
you know,
he'd be kind of happy about that.

303
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:11,251
And then he'd go back to his routine and
then she did that for I think about 20 

304
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:16,591
minutes.
It wasn't disruptive like all the other 

305
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:18,391
kids ate.
They didn't even really notice what was 

306
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:18,391
going on.
It wasn't,

307
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:18,391
it wasn't a big deal,
you know,

308
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:22,710
but I was watching because I knew 
something was up because the stupid 

309
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,221
thing that his mother said and then the 
fact that he wouldn't play and he 

310
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:26,221
ignored me,
I thought,

311
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:26,830
Nah,
there's some reading not good here,

312
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,410
this dragon here.
And it's a big one.

313
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,960
So she feeds him and then he finishes 
the whole bowl.

314
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,160
It's like.
And she says,

315
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:36,820
you're a good boy.

316
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,820
You ate the whole bowl and Jesus,
you should have seen what happened to 

317
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:41,820
that kid.
Man,

318
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,160
it just about broke my heart,
like really,

319
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,850
like his eyes got big and he smiled and 
he was just like,

320
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,880
he was super thrilled because he'd 
finally accomplished this absolute basic

321
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:54,770
necessity that he hadn't mastered in 
four years.

322
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,980
He finally got it right.
You think of all the meals that he went 

323
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,510
through either being ignored or failing 
three times a day for like three years,

324
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,200
nothing but failure and bad responses 
and you know,

325
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,620
he didn't turn light all that.
He thought he was a bad kid and then all

326
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:11,580
of a sudden he figured this out and you 
know,

327
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,620
get a little reward for.
It was like he just lit up and that 

328
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,391
whole shell that he had on the that he 
was like using to protect himself when 

329
00:15:19,391 --> 00:15:20,060
he was in the porch.

330
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,400
That just melted away.
It was like,

331
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,670
it was horrifying and amazing at the 
same time.

332
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:28,610
And then he followed my wife around 
after that in the house,

333
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,470
just like a puppy dog,
like he wouldn't get.

334
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,460
He would not get more than one foot away
from her.

335
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,850
It was unbelievable.
And then we went downstairs to watch 

336
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,300
like a movie with the kids and she sat 
on a rocking chair and he climbed right 

337
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:42,980
up on her lap and grabbed her just like 
that.

338
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:45,260
Harlow monkey grabbed the,
you know,

339
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:49,880
the little soft mother instead of the 
winery mother for teams like this.

340
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:52,580
And he was like that for like two hours.
He wouldn't let her go.

341
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,810
So then the mother came home,
his mother came home and she came 

342
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,470
downstairs and she looked at what was 
going on,

343
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:05,471
you know,
when this kid was like glommed onto my 

344
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:06,030
wife and she looked at her and she said,
oh supermom.

345
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,720
And you know,
took her kid and went home.

346
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,760
It's like Jesus,
like if you don't think there's a dragon

347
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,690
and that story,
man,

348
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:14,450
you are not listening to it.
It was not good.

349
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,300
And her response at the end was 
terrible.

350
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,390
She should've said,
well,

351
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:21,890
how do you get them to eat?
It's like,

352
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,480
what?
What the hell is he doing?

353
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,800
Like,
hugging you?

354
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:27,170
He never does that to me.
No way man.

355
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:32,171
She was going to let that piece of 
information in and it's no wonder 

356
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:35,591
because the dragon and that story was 
her and it was something she did not 

357
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:39,320
want to admit and she was willing,
perfectly willing to sacrifice her child

358
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:41,720
to that,
to her failure to realize that she could

359
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:46,721
be a dragon.
So that meant that the child was the 

360
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:47,720
problem and that's a hell of a thing to 
do to a four year old.

361
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,490
So it was not pleasant.
It was really not pleasant.

362
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,990
In fact,
we probably did damage to the child by 

363
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,140
actually getting them to do something 
good day because we opened up him up to 

364
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,660
the possibility that he could behave 
properly and be rewarded for that.

365
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,930
And that gave them hope.
And so you can bloody well be sure that 

366
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,080
that hope was dispensed with the next 
day.

367
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,520
So.

368
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,510
And that's why bill,
he doesn't get anything to eat.
