1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,490
Okay,
so it's in the 19 twenties.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,970
It's after the world.
After World War One rushes in pretty bad

3
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:10,971
shape.
The villages are full of brutalized men 

4
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:13,641
who have posttraumatic stress disorder 
and lots of people who are not doing 

5
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:15,720
well at all and the bloody intellectuals
come into the town and they say,

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,930
you know,
those successful farmers up the street 

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,450
that you've always been pretty jealous 
about in your useless manner while 

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,160
they're actually pigs and demons who are
stealing from you,

9
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:31,161
so why don't you come out,
we'll form a nice little mob and we'll 

10
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:31,920
take everything they've got.
And that's exactly what happened.

11
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:36,921
And all those people were killed or 
raped or set off to Siberia in the 

12
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:40,611
middle of the bloody winter where there 
wasn't even anything for them to to 

13
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:41,490
anywhere for them to live or anything 
for them to eat.

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,580
So they all died.
And then the consequence of that was a 

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,940
few years later,
6 million people starved to death in the

16
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:48,540
Ukraine.

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,410
And Malcolm Muggeridge had been 
reporting on that since the 19 thirties.

18
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:57,650
And so that was the.
That was the first wind really that the 

19
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,100
west God of exactly what was happening 
in the Soviet Union,

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,340
but even at that point,
that bloody left wing intellectuals in 

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,281
North America,
we're so damn clueless and in Europe 

22
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:07,281
that they never paid much attention to 
it with,

23
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:09,960
with the exception of certain number of 
people like George Orwell,

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,140
who wrote 1984 and animal farm,
which is of course a discussion.

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,140
The main pig in animal farm is stalad 
and of course,

26
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:23,160
and it's a story,
an allegory about the Russian revolution

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,970
whose basic motif is we're all equal,
but of course some all animals are 

28
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,411
equal,
but some are more equal than others and 

29
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:33,900
that's the motif.
That's the Motif of animal farm.

30
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,000
So there had been warnings all the way 
through,

31
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:41,001
right from the beginning of the Russian 
revolution to the West about exactly 

32
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:41,001
what was going on.

33
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:45,350
But because Communist and Marxist 
ideology is very good at Adelaide and 

34
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,640
the at the week binds of idiot 
intellectuals,

35
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,240
there was a huge section of the 
population who was fomenting,

36
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:53,340
I suppose,
against the standard.

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,930
What would you call it?
Political,

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,960
psychological and social order.
Who were absolutely committed to the 

39
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:05,571
ethic that's encased in statements like 
from each according to his ability to 

40
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:09,411
each according to his need,
which sounds perfectly wonderful if you 

41
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:12,651
think about it for about 15 seconds,
but if you think about it for six 

42
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:15,861
months,
becomes unbelievably murderous and its 

43
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:15,861
reach and,
and,

44
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:18,150
and the intent.
And so anyways,

45
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:23,151
the French for whatever reason,
seem to be particularly opaque to 

46
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:23,160
reason.
I'll give you an example.

47
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:24,090
So,
um,

48
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,520
the doctrine of Pol Pot in Cambodia that
also killed about 6 million people hit.

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,780
So what they did in Cambodia,
once the revolution occurred was decided

50
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:38,781
that everyone in the city were parasites
on the countryside because the 

51
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:40,440
countryside full of farmers was where 
the primary production was taking place.

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,440
And they regarded the city dwellers as 
parasites on that fundamental 

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,690
production.
So they basically emptied out the cities

54
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:49,290
and set,
sent all the people in the cities out to

55
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:53,010
work in the country as forced labor.
And 6 million people died there.

56
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:58,011
And the chief architect of that bloody 
project got his phd from the Sorbonne 

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,210
and said exactly what he was going to do
when he went back to Cambodia,

58
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:06,330
was cheered along by the French 
intellectuals who thought that that was 

59
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,260
just a fine idea.
So that's all background for why I don't

60
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:11,350
think any of you guys really know much 
about 20th century history.

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,680
So anyways,
what happened in the 19 seventies when 

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,390
when Soulja Nansen published the Gulag 
archipelago was the.

63
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,640
It was so brilliant,
the book and so overwhelming and it's 

64
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,740
emotional and intellectual and 
historical power that it became 

65
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,331
impossible for anyone to continue to 
claim that Marxism slash communism had 

66
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:39,130
any intellectual or ethical integrity 
whatsoever.

67
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,200
It was done,
it was done.

68
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,010
And that's part of the reason why he won
the Nobel Prize.

69
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,390
And part of the reason,
by the way,

70
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:51,340
why the Soviet Union collapsed because 
once word got out about exactly what was

71
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:56,341
actually going on,
there was no way of making a coherent 

72
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:58,060
argument in favor of say,
exporting the Worker's revolution around

73
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:03,061
the world.
It's like the consequence of that was 

74
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:06,150
well documented by social units and 
seeing the western intellectuals tried 

75
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,531
to make excuses for what had happened in
the Soviet Union by blaming it on 

76
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:14,911
Stalin's cult of personality,
perversion of the original accurate 

77
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:18,220
Marxist doctrine,
so they basically said,

78
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:23,221
well,
Lenin had Lenin lived because he died 

79
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,070
quite young and was replaced by Stella.
Had Lenin lived.

80
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,680
The promised Utopia would have been 
delivered,

81
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:29,020
but solzhenitsyn being an absolute 
genius,

82
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,290
documented the relationship number one 
be between the axioms of Marxist and 

83
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:40,291
communist thought and the laws that were
generated primarily by Lenin and the and

84
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:43,000
the construction of these camps and the 
Dea Kula,

85
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,620
causation and all the mass murders.

86
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,620
He documented the causal relationship 
between them and laid them clearly at 

87
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,370
the feet,
not of Stalin but of Lenin.

88
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,340
And so that was also a major blow 
because it.

89
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:59,341
It undermined the remaining argument of 
the left wing radical left wing 

90
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,490
apologists in,
in,

91
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,520
in the West for the,
for the viability of Marxist slash 

92
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,060
communist doctrines.
And you still hear people today.

93
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,280
Many people,
when they're faced with the,

94
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,300
you know,
if they're,

95
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:15,301
if they're,
if they're Marxist in their orientation 

96
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:17,761
and they're faced with the data 
pertaining to what happened in the 

97
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:17,761
Soviet Union,
they'll say something like,

98
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:19,210
well,
that wasn't real Marxism,

99
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,550
but one of the things that you might 
answer to that is,

100
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,360
well,
fine,

101
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:27,361
except that in every bloody country in 
the world where that doctrine was 

102
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:27,361
implemented,
new,

103
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,540
regardless of the wide cultural 
differences between the cultures,

104
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,380
say the Soviet Union,
China,

105
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,530
Cambodia and so forth.
Exactly the same thing happened every 

106
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:37,530
time.

107
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,260
And we still have a great example of 
that today in the form of North Korea.

108
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,560
I don't know if you've ever looked at a 
map of the world at night.

109
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,720
You know,
you can get a map of the entire globe at

110
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,280
night.
You look at South Korea,

111
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:53,281
it's lit up like jewels.
It's nothing but light like the east 

112
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:54,550
coast of the United States and Canada 
and North Korea is dark,

113
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,880
and the reason for that is that 50,
60 years of barbaric communist despotic 

114
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:06,101
rule means a country that's completely 
in an industrialized where every single 

115
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:08,360
person is malnourished or starving to 
death,

116
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,510
where everyone lives in terror all the 
time and where there's nothing but the 

117
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,471
continual production of labor in labor 
camps just like in the Soviet Union in 

118
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:17,471
Mao's,
China.

119
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,840
So if we were willing to pay attention,
we could still see examples of that 

120
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:22,880
today.
And that's not an anomaly.

121
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,480
North Korea is exactly what you'd expect
given the doctrines upon which it's 

122
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:28,480
founded.
