1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:06,550
The good estimates are that the Russians
killed about 30 million of their own 

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,280
people between 19,
19 in 1959,

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,570
you know,
and it's,

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,200
it's brutal.
It's brutal.

5
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:15,250
A lot of that was through starvation.
No,

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,570
I saw a photograph the other day which I
tweeted,

7
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:22,571
which is the worst photograph I've ever 
seen in my life and that's actually 

8
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:24,590
saying a lot because I've seen a lot of 
really terrible photographs because I've

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,100
done so much investigation into 
totalitarianism and this was a 

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,671
photograph that was taken during one of 
the early starvation periods in,

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,310
in the Soviet Union were about $3 
billion peasants died.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,490
It was a picture of a peasant couple 
standing behind a table at a market 

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,930
selling human body parts for food.
It's like,

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,090
and you know,
I have this weird quirk,

15
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,530
which I don't think does me much good,
but maybe helps me understand things 

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,890
better when I see that someone has done 
something extreme.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,090
I learned to do this a long time ago 
when I worked briefly in a maximum 

18
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,361
security prison.
I tried to imagine what I would have to 

19
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:11,921
be like,
what kind of situation I would have to 

20
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:12,860
find myself and to do that and believe 
me,

21
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:14,630
man,
that's a horrifying enter.

22
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,650
That's a horrifying enterprise because 
it is actually possible.

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,920
No matter what it is that you read about
someone doing and no matter how unlikely

24
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:28,961
it is that you think you would do that,
it's possible to imagine yourself in 

25
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,370
that situation

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,430
and that.

27
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,270
Well,
that's enlightening.

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,070
That's what I would say.
That's enlightening.

29
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,470
You know,
because one of the things about 

30
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,901
enlightenment is is that you get 
enlightened by doing things that are 

31
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:48,820
necessary that you really,
really,

32
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:51,940
really do not want to know.
You don't want to do.

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,600
And imagining imagining yourself as a 
perpetrator of that sort is that tells 

34
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:01,780
you something about the world and that 
tells you something about human beings.

35
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:05,830
But it's a hell of a thing to swallow.
You know,

36
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:10,831
and in a very well structured society 
like ours where were so peaceful.

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,180
Well,
because we have the heat and it always 

38
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,910
works and we have electricity and it 
always works.

39
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:21,670
And we have plumbing,
which is a bloody miracle,

40
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,310
and it always works,
you know,

41
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:29,311
it's just one of the things that this 
imagination process has done for me is 

42
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,640
keep me alert

43
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,490
to the absolute miracle that my life is 
every day.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,360
It's horribly cold out there.
You can't grow any food.

45
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,750
You die if you're out there for 24 
hours.

46
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,550
If any of this infrastructure was 
unreliable for any length of time,

47
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:53,480
we would be in serious trouble.
And it's never unreliable.

48
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,170
It's so unlikely.
And so here we are with all this 

49
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,900
reliable infrastructure and because of 
that,

50
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:04,090
we don't really have to compete with 
each other much.

51
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,180
I mean,
some you don't compete for food,

52
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,700
you don't compete for shelter or some 
people do,

53
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:13,030
but not very many.
So it's really easy to think of yourself

54
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:18,031
as good because you're not doing 
anything nasty to anyone.

55
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,550
But you know,
a cynic might say,

56
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:24,040
well that's just because you don't have 
any reason to.

57
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,260
But those reasons have arisen many times
in the past.

58
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:33,250
And in fact they're the norm,
not the exception.

59
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,340
We're the exception,
this insanely functional society that 

60
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,490
we've somehow managed to generate is 
it's incomprehensible to me that it 

61
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,120
exists.
