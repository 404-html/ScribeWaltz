1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,040
The routes are pulling on,
you can measure rat motivation by how 

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,910
hard they pull on this on the spring,
let's say,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,660
and they're more motivated if they're 
running away and running towards.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,690
But let's go back to play.
So you can take juvenile routes who 

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,871
haven't been able to play for a while,
maybe they've been isolated or maybe 

6
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:21,261
they just haven't been able to engage in
physical activity like many school 

7
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:22,830
children that you might be thinking 
about,

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,280
um,
neither allowed to play nor allowed to 

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,621
engage in physical activity.
And there's a reason I'm telling you 

10
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:30,621
that.
So anyways,

11
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:32,070
you get one of these little rats and you
can measure all hardy wants,

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,220
how hard it,
he'll pull the go out and play or how 

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:37,220
many buttons he'll push,
you know,

14
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,340
and that gives you an indication of his 
motivation.

15
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:43,341
So anyways,
you can see that the play deprived 

16
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:45,210
juvenile rat will fight harder to play 
than a non play deprived.

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,210
You've now rat.
And so you can infer that the rat wants 

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,600
to go play.
And uh,

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,920
you know,
you do that,

20
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,140
you do the same measurement with 
everyone around you.

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,440
If they want to do something,
you're going to poke and prod out them 

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,351
to see what sort of things they're 
willing to overcome in order to go and 

23
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:07,161
do that.
You'll object even if you don't really 

24
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:07,161
object.
It's like it's a measurement device.

25
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:09,990
And if they're willing to overcome a 
bunch of your objections,

26
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:10,650
then you think,
oh,

27
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:15,651
well maybe they really want to.
And that's another thing to really know 

28
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:19,430
if there's something you want,
you need about five arguments about why 

29
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,351
you wanted,
because the probability that the person 

30
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,051
who's opposing you will have five 
arguments about why you shouldn't have 

31
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:27,051
it,
is very low.

32
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:28,560
They just won't have thought it through 
enough.

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,860
So the other thing that happens in the 
future authoring exercises that you're 

34
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,131
asked to articulate the reasons for all 
the goals that come out of your vision 

35
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:37,950
of the future.

36
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,230
So you're asked like why would it be 
good for you?

37
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,410
Why would it be good for your family?
Why would it be good for broader 

38
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,141
society?
And so that gives you a three levels of 

39
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:48,930
argumentation right there,
and if you have it articulated down into

40
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:51,540
detail and it's related to other 
important goals,

41
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,870
then you're.
You're a hell of a thing to argue with 

42
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,390
because people just aren't that deep by 
which I mean they just don't have that 

43
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:04,521
many levels of explanation or objection.
And it's also really useful in 

44
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:08,571
relationship to your own mind.
Because if you want to do something 

45
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:08,820
that's difficult and that requires 
energy,

46
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,220
a lot of different subsystems in your 
mind,

47
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,870
you're going to throw up objections.
It's like,

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,140
well,
maybe that isn't what you should be 

49
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,521
doing right now.
Maybe you should be doing the dishes or 

50
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:19,521
vacuuming or watching TV or looking at 
youtube,

51
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:23,550
or if you're really sneaky when you're 
trying to do something hard,

52
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:28,551
what your brain does is give you 
something else hard to do that's not 

53
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:31,371
quite as hard so that you can feel 
justified in not doing the thing you're 

54
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:31,530
supposed to because you're doing 
something else useful.

55
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,800
And if you give into that temptation,
which you often will,

56
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,190
then it winds and because it winds,
it gets a little dopamine kick and it 

57
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,350
grows stronger.
Every.

58
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,380
Anything you let when the internal 
argument grows and anything you let be 

59
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:48,420
defeated,
shrinks because it's punished.

60
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,600
It doesn't get to have its way.
So that's another thing really to 

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,950
remember is don't practice what you do 
not want to become.

62
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,260
And because those are their neurological
circuits,

63
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,760
you build those things in there,
man,

64
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,410
they're,
they're not going anywhere.

65
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,990
You can build another machine to inhibit
them.

66
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,540
That's the best you can do.
Once they're in there,

67
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,730
you can't get them out.
So.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
And then the ones you build to inhibit 
can be taken out by stress.

69
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:17,530
And the old habits will come back up.
So you gotta be careful what you say and

70
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,440
what you do because you,
you build yourself that way.
