1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,250
To navigate,
there's two things you need to know when

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,900
the first is where the hell are you 
exactly,

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:09,750
precisely right.
Razor Sharp,

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,080
what's good about you and what's bad 
about you by your own buy your own 

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,080
reckoning.
You don't have to.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,730
You can ask other people,
but this is a game you play yourself.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,570
It's like as far as I'm concerned,
I'm taking star.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,600
What is it that's okay about being what 
needs some work and you've got to watch 

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,720
to not be too self critical when you're 
doing that too,

10
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:30,510
because that can just be another kind of
flaw and then the next is,

11
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:31,650
okay,
well where are you going?

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,860
What's your destination?
Well,

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,890
and that's what the frame is.
Now you know you could do that in a very

14
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:42,891
sophisticated way and you do that by 
thinking consciously about who it is 

15
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:46,170
that you are in an articulated manner 
and where you want to go and why and how

16
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,480
you're going to get there,
and people hardly ever do that.

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,510
That is,
that's come as such an absolute shock to

18
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:54,540
me as an educator.
I just,

19
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,590
because one of the other programs,
I use this in my classes,

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,430
what are the other programs in this 
suite of programs is called the future 

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,030
authoring program and I started 
developing my maps of meaning class,

22
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:11,031
which is where some of this materials 
from andI got students to write about 

23
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:11,031
their past.
It's like,

24
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:11,050
okay,
we're,

25
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,190
we're talking about stories,
so let's tell your story.

26
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:15,610
Who are you,
how'd you get here,

27
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:20,611
and what are you now.
That usually helps people put things to 

28
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:21,960
rest.
Although it's quite stressful.

29
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:22,860
Well,
you're doing it.

30
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,870
Stress goes up when you're doing it and 
maybe you feel miserable for a couple of

31
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,880
weeks and then stress goes down and it 
stays down.

32
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,910
So that's.
And that's also why people don't do it 

33
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:34,910
because who the hell wants to have their
stress go up?

34
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,930
But if it's temporary,
it's a sacrifice.

35
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,970
So then the next issue is,
well,

36
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:40,590
where are you going?
And one of the things that,

37
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,880
and this I just still,
I cannot understand you.

38
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,760
Students that had been in education 
system for 15 years,

39
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,770
14 years,
high end students.

40
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:52,980
Most of them,
not once in their whole bloody life.

41
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,490
Did anyone ever get them to sit down for
like a day and say,

42
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,820
all right,
justify your existence.

43
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,950
Like plus.
Seriously.

44
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,390
It's like,
here you are in university.

45
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:08,391
You're taking a bunch of courses,
you've got some sort of vague career 

46
00:02:08,391 --> 00:02:10,020
plan.
It's like defending the damn thing a bit

47
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:12,690
since you're going to go live it and 
everything.

48
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,910
You're staking everything on it.
It's like,

49
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,090
what's your damn plan and why are you so
convinced that it's not the plan of a 

50
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,060
babbling fool because if you haven't 
thought about it,

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,330
it is and if you really want to go out 
there and live that out,

52
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,840
you know one of the things Carl Jung 
said was that you,

53
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,730
you're in a story whether you know it or
not,

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,840
and then he made two nice comments about
that.

55
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,890
If it's someone else's story,
you're probably going to get a bit part 

56
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,240
and it might not be the one you want,
and if it's a story that you don't know,

57
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:50,241
it might be one with a really bad ending
or maybe it's just bad period with a 

58
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:54,441
worse ending,
and if you don't know what the story 

59
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,230
that you're living out is,
maybe that's the one you know.

60
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:58,110
Maybe you got that from your mother.
You got it from your grandmother,

61
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:03,111
you got it from your or God only knows 
where you picked it up because you pick 

62
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:04,390
up things like mad because that's what 
human beings are like.

63
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,660
So maybe you're living a malevolent 
tragedy unconsciously and then one thing

64
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:11,620
you might ask yourself is,
well,

65
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,990
how wretched and miserable is your life?
That said,

66
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,820
few title to that,
how wretched,

67
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,940
miserable and futile is your life.
And you might say,

68
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:21,790
well,
70 percent on each count.

69
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,790
It's like,
then you're probably unconsciously 

70
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,170
living out a malevolent tragedy and 
maybe that's not for the best.

71
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Oh,
it's either that or the whole universe 

72
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:34,800
hates you,
right?

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,080
Or 70 percent hates you,
you know,

74
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,670
so.
So anyways,

75
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:41,671
you know,
we got students to start writing in 

76
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:45,961
detail about not what they wanted.
It's not a career thing because that's 

77
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,150
the closest people usually get is they 
have a career plan.

78
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:49,670
It's like,
no,

79
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:51,010
no,
it's not a career plan.

80
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,140
That's,
that's peripheral important.

81
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:54,070
But peripheral,
it's like,

82
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,200
all right,
you got three years,

83
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,940
man,
you're going to live them anyways.

84
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,620
Devote those three years to setting the 
world up around you so that it's the 

85
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,741
best it can possibly be for you as if 
you were taking care of yourself as if 

86
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,160
you cared for yourself.
But what would that look like?

87
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,170
You know,
let's say just for the sake of argument,

88
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,780
if you figured out where you were that 
you could have,

89
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:18,130
what would be best for you?

90
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,620
Well,
what is that?

91
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,920
I bet you never asked.
People don't ask and so life comes out 

92
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:32,911
them like random snakes and they sort of
fend them off and life goes by and 

93
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,760
things don't work out the way people 
expected them to.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But a huge part of that is they didn't 
know where they were because they 

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,871
wouldn't look or didn't know that they 
should look ignorance and willful 

96
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:46,450
blindness,
right to great catastrophes,

97
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,990
and they never figured out where they 
wanted it to go or why.

98
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,170
Now there's a problem with figuring out 
where you want to go.

99
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,850
And the problem is is that you make your
conditions for failure clear to yourself

100
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,080
and people don't like that.
So if you keep yourself in the fog,

101
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,560
then you can't tell when you screwed up.
Now that isn't so good because you're 

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,311
still screwing up.
You're just to blind self blind to 

103
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:11,311
notice.

104
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,080
Although in in,
in the short term that's less painful.

105
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,440
If you make your criteria for success 
are razor sharp,

106
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:22,441
then you know every time you screw up.
But that's great because then you could 

107
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:25,180
fix it.
You can either repair the,

108
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,560
the,
the behavioral inadequacy or that 

109
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,630
conceptual inadequacy that you're using 
as a tool in that situation.

110
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,620
Or maybe you could adjust your damn plan
either way you can fix it.

111
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,050
And so,
okay,

112
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:42,790
so you're living in one of these bloody 
things and you might as well,

113
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,820
it seems to me you might as well make it
the best one you could live in because 

114
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,360
you don't have anything better to do.
Now,

115
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,270
if you don't do that,
if you don't do it consciously,

116
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,950
and this is what the psychoanalyst 
pointed out is that you have innumerable

117
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,820
quasi autonomous subsystems that make 
you up,

118
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,350
that will generate stories impulsively 
and you'll just act them out.

119
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,800
And you know that because you watch 
yourself over two weeks and you think,

120
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,750
Jesus,
I did a lot of stupid things in the last

121
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,280
two weeks.
And you think,

122
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,320
why?
And it's because you're a random.

123
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:20,390
You're a collection of somewhat random,
quasi autonomous personality units and 

124
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,780
lacking a leader.
They're just going to fire off whenever 

125
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:25,780
they want.
You know,

126
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,420
first you're hungry,
then you're thirsty.

127
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,920
Then you want to go to bed with your 
wife,

128
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:32,921
you know,
then you want to sleep in and you want 

129
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:34,961
to tell your boss off.
Then you want to curse at the guy that 

130
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:35,510
cuts you off in traffic.
It's like you're kind of like a two year

131
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:36,740
old,
you know,

132
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:41,741
just it's one emotional frame after 
another vying for dominance.

133
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:46,100
There's no overarching hierarchy and 
there's no king at the top.
