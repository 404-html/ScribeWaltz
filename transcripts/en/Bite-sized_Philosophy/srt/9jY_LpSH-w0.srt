1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
So here's a cool psychological study,
so it's called the marshmallow test and 

2
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:11,271
maybe it's even a reliable study.
Even though it was done by social 

3
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:14,961
psychologists,
it's probably replicable and it's a nice

4
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:19,590
study.
So you take small children and you bring

5
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:23,040
them into a room and you put something 
that they would like in front of them,

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,150
a marshmallow and you then you torture 
them.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,900
Basically you say,
see that marshmallow in the kid thinks,

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,670
man,
I see that marshmallow.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's like you can have that marshmallow 
right now or if you wait,

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,990
I think the experiment is 10 minutes.
Then you can have two marshmallows.

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,150
And so that puts the child in quite a 
conundrum because they're being asked to

12
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:53,151
trade in actual concrete,
tangible marshmallow for two 

13
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:57,651
hypothetical future marshmallows and 
it's not that easy to conjure up a 

14
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:02,751
hypothetical future reality that has the
same tangible significance as something 

15
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,490
real right in front of you.

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,070
And so it's amazing thing that people 
can do that.

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,250
And so then the experimenter leaves and 
some children's grabbed the marshmallow 

18
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,180
and just chomp that thing down right 
now.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Other kids,
they videotaped kids while they're 

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,900
waiting and they do all sorts of things.
They whistled,

21
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:24,180
they look at the ceiling,
they sit on their hands,

22
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:25,920
you know,
they tried to distract themselves.

23
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:30,921
Course they're eyeing that marshmallow 
like a squirrel lying and not and and 

24
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:35,691
trying to restrain themselves and you 
know what I see in that is that the 

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,900
child's prefrontal Cortex,
the higher cortical systems are warring 

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,920
with the underlying motivational 
systems,

27
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:47,310
more primordial motivational systems 
that govern such things as hunger.

28
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,670
The hunger system,
hypothalamic system says there's 

29
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,460
something sweet and fat right?
Sitting there,

30
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:56,550
right bloody now grab that thing and 
stuff it down now,

31
00:01:56,551 --> 00:02:01,551
and I'm sure many of you have a constant
battle with your hypothalamus with 

32
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:05,631
regards to sweet and fat things and 
often lose so you can feel some sympathy

33
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:11,751
for the child,
but the hypothalamus has these 

34
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:14,520
tremendously powerful tendrils upward 
into the brain,

35
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,770
into the parts that we would associate 
more with voluntary control and the 

36
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,571
voluntary control centers have these 
little weak ribbons going down to 

37
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:24,360
control the hypothalamus.

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Since it's pretty obvious,
if you know something about 

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,390
neuroanatomy,
what part is actually in charge when the

40
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:35,391
chips are down,
and it's not easy for children to learn 

41
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:36,750
to regulate those underlying primordial 
impulses,

42
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,810
the ones that are wired in,
the ones that we share with animals,

43
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,320
but they do it and and,
and the cool thing is,

44
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,950
this is what Walter Michelle found.
He's the guy who did the study,

45
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:51,951
was that the longterm outcome for the 
children who can delay gratification in 

46
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:57,381
the marshmallow test is much more 
positive than it is for the children 

47
00:02:57,381 --> 00:02:59,710
that are impulsive and eat the 
marshmallow instantly.

48
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,140
It's delay of gratification.
Now it's likely that that's associated 

49
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,031
with trait conscientiousness,
although that specifically has that 

50
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:10,480
specific connection has not yet been 
established,

51
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,420
but they seem conceptually very,
very similar.

52
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,080
So.
So anyways,

53
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,380
this emerges in children probably 
between the ages of two and four,

54
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:24,250
something like that.

55
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,640
They should have it in place by four 
because it's very difficult for them to 

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,081
really interact well with other children
without having that delay of 

57
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:37,171
gratification in place.
Because if you can't delay 

58
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:39,661
gratification,
other kids don't like you because 

59
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:42,120
you're.
You want everything your way and you 

60
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,371
want it now and you're.
You're liable to temper tantrums and 

61
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:44,371
that sort of thing.
You haven't got the kind of self control

62
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:48,820
necessary to make you fun to play with 
so you can see that emerging in children

63
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:53,821
and it's pretty.
It's pretty interesting and not only 

64
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:53,821
that,
if it emerges,

65
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:57,661
it predicts positive longterm outcomes 
just like trait conscientiousness does 

66
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,940
by the way,
because trait conscientiousness is the 

67
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,890
second best predictor of longterm 
success over the lifespan.

68
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,930
In Western cultures,
it's second after intelligence and so in

69
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:12,931
our societies,
the people who do best across time are 

70
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:16,241
the people who have high Iq is and who 
work hard and I would say that's a 

71
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,070
pretty decent,
what would you call it?

72
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:24,150
It's a validation in some sense that our
cultures are working properly because 

73
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,751
what you would want,
I would say if the system is working 

74
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:31,831
meritocratic Lee like it should,
and if you're trying to extract 

75
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:36,090
resources from those who can contribute 
at a higher rate than what you would 

76
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,310
want to have happen is that the hard 
working smart people do better.

77
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,380
Hopefully.
If that's the case,

78
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,510
then everyone does better.
Hopefully.
