1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,380
You're,
you're an admirer of Eric Norman and off

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,260
Carl Young.
Yeah.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,300
That's the human connection is really 
interesting because I think he's a 

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,181
bloody genius.
I really liked the great mother is a 

5
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:11,190
great book and it really a great 
warning.

6
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:16,191
That book and also the origins and 
history of consciousness is influential 

7
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:16,740
book.
Yeah.

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,080
That's so interesting.
I read an essay that you wrote,

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,400
I don't remember when it was at the Nyu.
Yes,

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,430
yes.
It's always been staggering to me that 

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:28,430
that book hasn't had the impact that it 
should have had.

12
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,751
I mean young himself in the preface to 
that book wrote that that was the book 

13
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:32,820
that he wished that he would have 
written.

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,030
It's very much associated with young 
symbols of transformation and it was a 

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,150
major influence on my book,
maps of meaning,

16
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:44,151
which was an attempt to outline the 
universal archetypes that are portrayed 

17
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:45,590
in the kind of religious structures that
you,

18
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,850
that you put forward,
but the thing that I really see 

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:50,850
happening,
and you can tell me what you think about

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,341
this and in Norman's book consciousness,
which is masculine symbolically 

21
00:00:55,341 --> 00:01:00,321
masculine for a variety of reasons,
is is viewed as rising up against the 

22
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:06,171
countervailing force of tragedy from an 
underlying feminine symbolically 

23
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:06,900
feminine unconsciousness.

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,900
Right?
And it's something that can always be 

25
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,540
pulled back into that unconsciousness.
That would be the microcosm of.

26
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:17,541
That would be the Freudian eatable 
mother femineity old dynamic where the 

27
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:21,771
mother was so over protective and all 
encompassing that she interferes with 

28
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:23,550
the development of the competence not 
only of her sons,

29
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,800
but also of her daughters,
of her children in general.

30
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,310
And it seems to me that that's the 
dynamic that's being played out in our 

31
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,270
society right now is that there's this 
and it's.

32
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:34,770
It's related in some way that I don't 
understand to this,

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,920
to this insistence that all forms of 
masculine and authority or nothing by 

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,671
tyrannical power.
So the symbolic representation is 

35
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:48,350
tyrannical father with no appreciation 
for the benevolent father and benevolent

36
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:52,080
mother with no appreciation whatsoever 
for the tyrannical mother.

37
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,190
Right?
And that's that.

38
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,660
And because I thought of videology as 
fragmentary mythologies,

39
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,790
that's where they get their archetypal 
in psychological power,

40
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,270
right?

41
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,270
And so on and balanced representation.
You have the terrible mother and the 

42
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,841
great mother as as Norman laid out so 
nicely and you have the terrible father 

43
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:13,641
and the great father.
So that's the fact that culture mangles 

44
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:16,460
you have to death well.
It's also promoting you and developing 

45
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,401
you.
You have to see that as balanced and 

46
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:19,401
then you have the heroic and adversarial
individual.

47
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:24,290
But in the postmodern world,
and this seems to be something that's 

48
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,410
increasingly seeping out into the 
culture at large,

49
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,660
you have nothing but the tyrannical 
father.

50
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,870
Nothing but the destructive force of 
masculine consciousness and nothing but 

51
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,220
the benevolent,
benevolent great mother,

52
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:40,221
and it's an.
It's an appalling ideology and it seems 

53
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:43,131
to me that it's sucking the vitality,
which is exactly what you would expect 

54
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:47,181
symbolically.
It's sucking the vitality of our 

55
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:49,341
culture.
You see that with the increasing 

56
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:49,740
demolition of,
of young men,

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,410
um,
and not only young men in terms of their

58
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:55,180
academic performance,
which like they're falling way behind in

59
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:58,650
elementary school way behind in junior 
high and bailing out of the universities

60
00:02:58,651 --> 00:02:59,430
like mad.
