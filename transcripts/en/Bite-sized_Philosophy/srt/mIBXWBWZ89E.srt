1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,300
The second thing is what the story,
the creation stories in genesis,

2
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:07,380
for example,
actually need because they actually mean

3
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:11,220
something and what they mean is 
absolutely remarkable in my estimation.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,460
And so I'm going to tell you a little 
bit about that story because it's 

5
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:21,531
necessary to understand what the story 
means to determine if what Nisha said 

6
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:25,221
about the inevitable destruction of our 
symbolic religious structures by science

7
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:29,610
was inevitable and necessary.
And I think the answer to that is no.

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,850
We just didn't understand what the hell 
we were doing any more than we really 

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,730
understand why we put up Christmas trees
at Christmas.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,960
So we do that in part because the 
Christmas tree is a symbol of life 

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,531
because the tree is a symbol of life 
because we inhabited trees for untold 

12
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:49,431
millions of years and we put lights on 
the trees to symbolize the coming back 

13
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:52,650
into the darkness of Midwinter of the 
Sun and the light.

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:58,130
And so we play this symbolic game that 
celebrates both life and the emergence 

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,781
of light and consciousness.
And we associate that with the birth of 

16
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:02,790
the savior.
But we don't know that we're doing that.

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,180
But we do it anyways so,
and we do that sort of thing all the 

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,851
time because we're smarter than we know 
and that has to be the case because we 

19
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:14,661
don't know ourselves.
We would need a psychology or sociology 

20
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:16,110
and anthropology or any of those things.
If we were transparent to ourselves.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,230
We're machines so to speak,
that are far more intelligent and wise.

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,950
Then the machines themselves can 
understand and we've reveal ourselves to

23
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:26,720
ourselves,
you know,

24
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:29,430
our action and our symbolic gestures 
constantly.

25
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,610
And then have to reflect on that to try 
to understand what it is that we're up 

26
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:34,610
to.
