1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,190
As another way of representing it,
the dragon of chaos stands for the 

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,340
potential that surrounds us.
Inside of that,

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,120
there's the unknown,
the unknown that you actually come into 

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,120
contact with,
right?

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,410
That's the unknown as it actually 
manifests itself in your world as 

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,890
something you don't understand,
instead of just the potential for that,

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,880
because we say,
look,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,430
you know perfectly well that as you're 
sitting here,

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,280
there's all sorts of things you don't 
know everywhere,

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,860
but where are they?
Well,

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,890
they're not manifesting themselves at 
the moment.

12
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:33,110
They're only in potential,
but you could.

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,230
We could have a discussion that that 
became argumentative and then all of a 

14
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,101
sudden it would be as if emissaries of 
that unknown had entered the space and 

15
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:44,930
that's the unknown that's defined in 
relationship to what you know.

16
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:48,080
That's what you actually experienced.
Instead of it only being potential.

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,570
It's a tough thing to get because 
they're both unknown,

18
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:50,840
right?

19
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:51,650
You think,
well,

20
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:56,651
how can there be two different 
categories of unknown while latent and 

21
00:00:56,651 --> 00:00:57,050
manifest?
That's a good way of thinking about it.

22
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,060
You know,
you in a relationship,

23
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:04,061
it's going stable,
but you know that sooner or later 

24
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:04,490
something will come up.
Okay,

25
00:01:04,491 --> 00:01:07,430
op from where?
Why?

26
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:10,220
Up from beneath?
Well,

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,020
what do you mean beneath?
While it's from.

28
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,820
It's from your complex,
the person you're in,

29
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:19,821
a relationship with it in width is 
complicated and complex that's implicit 

30
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:21,150
in you.
It's,

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,130
it's inside your conceptual structure.
That's,

32
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:27,710
that's the way of looking at it now and 
then when there's a disagreement,

33
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:31,550
it will manifest itself and you know 
that you know that they're still trouble

34
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,220
brewing ahead,
interrelationship always,

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,870
and that's part of what keeps them 
alive.

36
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,400
The interesting piece of empirical work 
done on this awhile back,

37
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,240
so you might think,
well,

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,020
what is the optimal relationship look 
like in terms of positive and negative 

39
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,020
emotion?
You might say,

40
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,080
well,
Utopia,

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,530
nothing but positive interactions.
It's like no.

42
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,220
Now imagine you get people to code the 
interactions they have with their 

43
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,560
partner during the day.
You know,

44
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:00,210
you sample it,
you say,

45
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:02,010
was that interaction positive or 
negative?

46
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,550
And then what you're trying to do is 
predict the longevity of the 

47
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:07,550
relationship.
Okay,

48
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,571
so here's the data.
If it falls under five positive 

49
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:12,720
interactions to one negative 
interaction,

50
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,600
the relationship doesn't continue.
Fair enough.

51
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,790
Too much negative.
That's easy to understand.

52
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,670
If it exceeds 11 positive to one 
negative,

53
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:22,950
the relationship doesn't last.
Why?

54
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,330
No challenge,

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,300
right?
What do you want from your partner?

56
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,590
Bless.
No,

57
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,340
no,
no.

58
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:35,341
You don't.
You want periods of peace punctuated by 

59
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:36,850
a good fight and that because that means
you respect them,

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,040
means you have something to offer each 
other and it means that you're both 

61
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,570
growing and so you don't want the fight 
to be too dramatic because,

62
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,700
well then you retreat.
You can't settle it,

63
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:50,701
but the person that you can completely 
map and who only does positive things 

64
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:50,770
for you,
it's like a.

65
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,860
You don't know that person B,
they're not communicating with you nor 

66
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,191
you with them.
Maybe they're just subordinating 

67
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:00,070
themselves to you or you to them and 
you're not growing.

68
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,220
You want someone who can.
It's a real relationship is a wrestling 

69
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,500
match.
It's a grappling,

70
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,530
grappling phenomena that you both 
emerged,

71
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,780
transformed from,
and that's what people want.

72
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,990
They don't want a pushover.
Not Not unless there's something wrong 

73
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,961
with them,
and when narcissistic person who never 

74
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:22,291
wants to be challenged will want a 
partner who does nothing but deliver 

75
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,270
exactly what they're told to deliver,
but they will mistreat the beyond belief

76
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,100
and perhaps deservedly so.
