1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,960
Is there a concrete example of something
where you,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,110
you said you said something,
and I'm not thinking of anything in 

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,110
particular.
I'm being entirely genuine year.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,340
Is there an instance where you,
where you feel you said something that 

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,600
appeared to be true to you at the time 
and knowing what you know?

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,040
Yes.
I think I was little.

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,130
I think I was a little dismissive of the
men going their own way because I think 

8
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:25,290
I called them pathetic weasels,
which,

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,710
and I had my reasons for that.
My reasons were roughly speaking,

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,470
who are the men going their own way 
frequently?

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,600
Well,
there are a group of people mostly on 

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,941
the net who have had,
who've been burned in their 

13
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:41,241
relationships or who conceptualize 
themselves as having been burned in 

14
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,721
their relationships and they believe 
that the legal structure in particular 

15
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:46,410
in western countries is so tilted 
against men,

16
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:50,490
particularly in family dispute 
situations that end divorce settlement,

17
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:54,390
that it's safer for men not to establish
permanent relationships with women,

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,280
not to cohabit with them ever and there 
are large movement now.

19
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:00,840
How large they are.
I don't know,

20
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:05,841
but they're large enough and they have.
What I would regard as an undue 

21
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:11,271
influence over relatively bitter and 
resentful young men who haven't had 

22
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:16,821
great success in the dating market and 
who are looking for a rationale to write

23
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:23,121
off all women because they are so hurt 
by their continual rejection and that is

24
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:28,251
not good for those young men,
and so the reason that I disparaged the 

25
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:31,860
men going their own way was because I 
had seen the pernicious effect.

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,860
These are often older guys,
the pernicious effect of their world.

27
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:41,871
Weary philosophy on young men.
Now these guys think that they're just 

28
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:44,580
warning them and they are warning them,
but they're not just warning them.

29
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,820
Now,
the reason I really regret calling them 

30
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:49,820
pathetic weasels is because they also 
have a point.

31
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,920
I do believe that the court systems are 
staggeringly anti male,

32
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,580
absurdly horribly anti male,
and I've seen my own clients,

33
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,770
some of them who are really,
really decent,

34
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,210
hardworking,
family oriented people demolished by the

35
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:11,211
court systems and and so the men going 
their own way have a point.

36
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,430
And so I'm sorry that I called them 
pathetic weasels,

37
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,340
but I.
But I outlined my reasons and so yes,

38
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:25,341
I do regret that I have to be careful 
because I do have a satirical,

39
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,010
dark,
satirical sense of humor and I can outer

40
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,260
epithets,
let's say for the sake of punctuating 

41
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,140
appoint well simultaneously forgetting 
that 150,000

42
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,930
people will listen to it.
So.

43
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,080
So I regret that.
