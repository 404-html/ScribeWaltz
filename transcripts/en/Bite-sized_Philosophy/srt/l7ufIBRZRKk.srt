1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,230
That says office and you need to set of 
scissors,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,580
if I remember correctly,
that one has to imagine him happy.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,940
Well,
if there's a rock at the bottom of the 

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,041
hill,
then you might as well push it up the 

5
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,991
hill and if it rolls back down,
well then you've got something else to 

6
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:14,991
do.
Don't you can push the damn rock back up

7
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:19,641
the hill and there's no shortage of 
rocks to put up to push up the hill and 

8
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:23,631
that's what we're built for anyways,
and so let's go out and like push them 

9
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:23,760
down,
boulders up the hill,

10
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:27,780
and then maybe we could have enough self
confidence and enough enough respect for

11
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:32,781
ourselves that we wouldn't have to turn 
to hatred and revenge and try to take 

12
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:33,810
everything down because I think that's 
the alternative.

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,420
So he's not weak.
That's one thing you can say about them.

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,720
Same idea represented there,
right?

15
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:45,540
That's outlets who voluntarily takes the
world on his shoulders.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,230
It's like the idea of Christ taking the 
sins of the world on his shoulders.

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,350
It's exactly the same notion,
which is the notion that you should be 

18
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,681
able to recognize in yourself all the 
horror of humanity and take 

19
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:02,001
responsibility for it because that's 
what that means and the thing that's so 

20
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:04,020
interesting about that is that if you 
can recognize yourself in yourself,

21
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:09,021
all the horror of humanity,
you will instantly have a hell of a lot 

22
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:09,870
more respect for yourself than you did 
before you did that.

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,680
Because there's some real utility in 
knowing that you're a monster now.

24
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:16,860
And just because you're a monster 
doesn't mean you have to be a monster.

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,320
But it's really useful to know that you 
are one.

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,740
So the and,
and one of the things that you knew,

27
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:27,741
and this is something that I find so 
amazing about his writings and I think 

28
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:27,810
something that really distinguishes 
them,

29
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,900
for example,
from Joseph Campbell who talked about 

30
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,450
following your bliss,
is like young said very clearly that the

31
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:36,450
first step to enlightenment is the 
encounter with the shadow.

32
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,850
And what he meant by that was everything
horrible that human beings have done was

33
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,360
done by human beings.
And your one of the.

34
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,930
And so if you don't understand that and 
to understand that really means to know 

35
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,910
how it was that you could have done it,
and that's a shattering thing,

36
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,150
to try to imagine that,
to try to imagine yourself as someone 

37
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,920
who's engaged in medieval torture,
to see how you could in fact do that.

38
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,780
You're never the same after you learn 
that,

39
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,700
but being never the same after learning 
that is unbelievably useful because when

40
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,950
you understand that,
that's what you're like,

41
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,410
then you're a whole different creature.
And I don't think,

42
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:15,000
and this is something I did learn from 
young,

43
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:20,001
is that you cannot be a good person 
until you know how much evil you contain

44
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:22,200
within you.
It is not possible.

45
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,510
And it's partly because you just don't 
have any potency.

46
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,930
Like if you're just naive,
if you're just nice,

47
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,040
if you'd never heard anyone you'd never 
heard of fly.

48
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,740
You don't have the capability for any of
that.

49
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,200
Why would anyone ever take you?
Seriously?

50
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,670
You're,
you're just,

51
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,950
you're a domestic animal at best,
you know,

52
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,660
and uh,
rather contemptible one at that.

53
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,810
And it's a very strange thing because 
you wouldn't think that the revelation 

54
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,891
of the capacity for evil is a 
precondition for the realization of 

55
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:48,891
good,
but I believe,

56
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:53,840
first of all,
why would you be serious enough to even 

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,631
attempt to pursue the good unless you 
had some sense of what the consequence 

58
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:58,060
was of not doing it.
You.

59
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,940
You have to be serious about these sorts
of things.

60
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:01,910
It's not a.
it's not a.

61
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
it's not the game of a child,
right?

62
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:06,100
It's the game of a fully developed 
adult.

63
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,280
And you have learned this in part when I
had little kids,

64
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,180
I wrote a chapter for my new book called
never let your children do anything that

65
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:14,080
makes you dislike them.

66
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,450
And why was that?
And I read,

67
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,510
I read that,
wrote that after I knew I was a monster 

68
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,780
and I thought,
I'm going to make sure I like my kids.

69
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,740
I'm going to make sure that they behave 
around me so that I liked them because 

70
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,790
I'm way bigger than them and I'm way 
more cruel than they are.

71
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,570
And I've got tricks up my sleeve that 
they cannot even possibly imagine.

72
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,510
And if,
if they irritate me,

73
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,350
I will absolutely take it out on them.
And if you don't think that you're the 

74
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,161
sort of person that would do that,
then you are the sort of person who is 

75
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:47,440
doing it.
