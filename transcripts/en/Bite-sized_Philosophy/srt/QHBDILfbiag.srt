1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,850
What I like about this,
you see the fact that the,

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,250
the,
the culture of the patriarchy,

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,990
God,
the father will say here is,

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,010
is holding the suffering individual in 
his arms and that's encapsulated by 

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:15,780
nature.
It's,

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,050
it's very much like the story in 
Pinocchio where Japan Know Pinocchio 

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,911
wasn't able to go down into the depths 
to confront the terrible monster at the 

8
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:27,750
bottom of being without having support 
from his father.

9
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:29,940
Even though his father ended up trapped 
inside the whale.

10
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:32,100
If he wouldn't have been supported to 
begin with,

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,230
he wouldn't have been able to do it.
And you know,

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,690
I've really seen this.
I've really seen this in people.

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,720
It's a hell of a thing not to have the 
confidence of your father.

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,120
It's really,
really hard on people.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,300
You know,
if your father is someone who says to 

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:47,300
you,
you can do it,

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:47,300
I really believe that you can do it.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,100
I'll support you in what you're doing.
I think that you can sort it out and 

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,581
then acts towards you in that way.
That's a gift that really almost no one 

20
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:56,490
else can provide you with mothers 
obviously provide.

21
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,440
I think they provide the same kind of 
gift,

22
00:00:58,441 --> 00:00:59,790
but earlier,
you know,

23
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:04,791
because the mother has to take care of 
the infant when the infant is just 

24
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,700
completely dependent and so,
and this is Erickson's idea to Eric 

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,110
Erickson is the mother is,
is the person who establishes the 

26
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,310
relationship that allows the developing 
person to manifest trust,

27
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:17,070
real truck while you're being carried 
for crying out loud,

28
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:20,460
you know you can be dropped and the 
mother is also the source of food,

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,880
but the father seems to be something 
like the and I'm being.

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,480
I'm obviously parsing these things 
farther apart than they can be need to 

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,511
be because the father can play a 
nurturing role in the mother 

32
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:32,511
complaining,
encouraging role,

33
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:33,690
but we'll,
we'll keep it simple for now.

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,170
The father seems to be the thing that 
supports and encourages and says,

35
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:37,590
well,
yeah,

36
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:42,591
you know,
you're little and small and all of that 

37
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:42,591
and you're subject to destruction and 
and,

38
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,210
and bullying and social pressure and all
that.

39
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:48,420
But I know you can do it.
I know you can do it and there's a force

40
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:53,421
in that that's unbelievable.
And people who don't have that half a 

41
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:56,270
have a hell of a time.
It's actually one of the things that's 

42
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,001
quite fun about doing psychotherapy 
because you get people who have damaged 

43
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:01,410
father figures.
It's harder with a damaged mother figure

44
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,810
a because it's so bloody deep.
You know?

45
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:08,811
I had a client who I just,
I just thought she was a remarkable 

46
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:09,000
person,
but her relationship with her mother was

47
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:10,500
really disrupted.
It was really,

48
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:12,720
really hard to.
She said she would.

49
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,770
She.
She told me it was like something had 

50
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:17,770
been torn out of her at an early age 
that couldn't be replaced.

51
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,010
It's ray because you just can't be 
someone's mother,

52
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:21,780
you know,
it's really hard.

53
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,890
You're just not there enough for that.
But you can sort of be someone surrogate

54
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:29,040
father that's a,
that's a role you can play later.

55
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,170
And that's what educators do at least to
some degree,

56
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:36,171
although now they're trying to be 
mothers and providing safe spaces and 

57
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:39,111
all of that,
which is not really all that 

58
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:39,111
appropriate.
So that.

59
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:41,610
So the father is an encouraging figure 
and allows the individual,

60
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:46,611
at least in principle,
to support the catastrophe of being 

61
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:48,870
voluntarily and so anyways,
so those,

62
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:49,740
you know,
those images,

63
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:51,990
they're just be a brilliant beyond 
belief.

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,820
Absolutely brilliant.
Beyond belief.
