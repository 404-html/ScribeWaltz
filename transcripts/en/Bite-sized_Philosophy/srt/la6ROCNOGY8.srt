1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,480
Okay,

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,260
that's Martin,
so the story of Martin,

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,960
I'll just give it to you very briefly.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,860
Timeout and aps who are locked in,
embrace it at the beginning of time.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,610
God is of salt water,
garden,

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,690
fresh water together,
chaos in order,

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,820
right?
They give rise,

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:19,870
masculine,
feminine.

9
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:22,750
They give rise to the world of the elder
gods and those are to me,

10
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:27,751
they're primordial motivational forces 
or something like that and their rage 

11
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:32,851
and their lost and their love and all 
these things that possess us that are 

12
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:35,881
there forever and they're out in the 
world acting and they carelessly slay 

13
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:40,850
appsu their father and their making a 
rocket and then they collapsed and then 

14
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:46,441
tie them out,
gets wind of that and that's time out 

15
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:46,441
right there.
By the way,

16
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:51,090
she's kind of a rough looking creature 
and she's the mother of all things and 

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,231
so she's not very happy about this.
These are her children have destroyed 

18
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:59,910
structure itself,
plus they're noisy and careless and so 

19
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,910
she thinks all right,
just like,

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,190
no.

21
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,750
I'm just like the God that brings the 
flood to know what exactly the same idea

22
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,430
time matt comes back and says,
yeah,

23
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:07,990
okay,
enough is enough.

24
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,400
I'm going to take you out,
and she makes this battalion of monsters

25
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:15,910
and puts the worst monster there is that
the head of the battalion,

26
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:21,150
his name is king who he's like a 
precursor to the idea of Satan and she 

27
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,450
lets the gods know,
hey,

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,660
I'm coming for you,
and so they're not very happy about this

29
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:26,890
because their gods.
But like,

30
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,470
yeah,
she's chaos itself,

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,030
right?
She gave birth to everything.

32
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:36,150
This is no joke,
and so they send one got out after 

33
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,270
another to confront her and they all 
come back with their tails between their

34
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:42,271
legs.
There is no hope and then one day 

35
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:42,271
there's a new guard that emerges and 
that's.

36
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:44,230
And the guards know.
As soon as he pops up,

37
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:45,460
they know he's something new.

38
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,820
Remember,
this is happening while the 

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,231
Mesopotamians are assembling themselves 
into one of the world's first great 

40
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:56,431
civilizations.
So all the gods of all those tribes are 

41
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:59,701
coming together to organize themselves 
into a hierarchy to figure out what 

42
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:03,601
proposition rules everything.
And so Marta is elected by all the gods 

43
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:04,450
and he says,
look,

44
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:06,580
I'll go out there and I'll take on time 
map,

45
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:09,520
but here's the rule from on,
you follow me.

46
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,280
I determine destiny.
I'm the top God.

47
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,080
I'm the thing at the top of the 
hierarchy.

48
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,910
And all the other gods say,
hey look,

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,430
no problem.
You get rid of chaos.

50
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,530
We do exactly what you say.
Now Marta,

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,580
his eyes all the way around his head and
he speaks magic words.

52
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,720
Those are his primary attributes.
And so he takes a net and he goes out to

53
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,850
confront timeout.
And,

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,950
and he,
he,

55
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,060
he,
he encloses her in the net,

56
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:36,580
which I think is so cool because it's an
encapsulation,

57
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:38,470
right?
It's a conceptual encapsulation.

58
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,830
He encloses chaos itself in a conceptual
structure.

59
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,060
He puts it in the net and then he cuts 
her into pieces and he makes the world.

60
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,410
And then that he creates human beings to
inhabit that world and to serve the 

61
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:59,791
gods.
And he creates human beings out of the 

62
00:02:59,791 --> 00:02:59,800
blood of King of the worst,
the demons.

63
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,010
And that took me to call Andy Young,
who was a student of mine,

64
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:08,011
helped me figure that out.
I thought that's pretty damn 

65
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:08,011
pessimistic.
It's like,

66
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:09,820
you know what exactly?
It sounds like a full metaphor.

67
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,580
It's like the idea of original sin,
but,

68
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,190
but our joint conclusion

69
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:21,010
with regards to that was that human 
beings are the only creatures in 

70
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,900
creation that can truly deceive,
right?

71
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:28,901
We have the capacity for evil,
just like it says in the Adam and Eve 

72
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:28,901
story.
We can actually do that.

73
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:29,710
And that's why we're made out of the 
blood of King,

74
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:34,070
knew the king of the demons.
The we are the thing that can deceive,

75
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,740
that can twist the structure of reality.
Well.

76
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:41,741
So Marduk now the,
the team has had an emperor and the 

77
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:42,860
emperor was the

78
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,590
Avatar of Marta.
That's what made them emperor.

79
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:48,730
He was only at Emperor.
If he was going to be Murdoch,

80
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:50,450
he had to be a good Marduk.
Which man he,

81
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:55,451
I do confront time,
chaos and cut her up and make order out 

82
00:03:55,451 --> 00:04:00,081
of her pieces.
And what the Mesopotamians used to do 

83
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:02,451
after New Year's celebration,
they'd go outside their walled city and 

84
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,780
that's explored territory versus 
unexplored territory.

85
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:06,000
They go outside their world's city into 
chaos,

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,540
and they bring all the statutes that 
represented the gods and they'd act this

87
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,550
out because they were trying to figure 
something out,

88
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,580
right?
You're trying to figure out what this 

89
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:16,580
means.
They're acting it out,

90
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,790
and then they'd take their emperor and 
the priest would make them kneel and 

91
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,270
they take all his king.
He is king.

92
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:26,271
Uniform off is emperor uniform off and 
make them Neil and humiliate them and 

93
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:27,750
nail them with a glove and say,
okay,

94
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,240
how were you not a good Martech this 
year?

95
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,660
Right?
And then he'd recount all the ways that 

96
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,151
he was inadequate in confronting chaos.
And then they'd do the celebration and 

97
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:41,250
Martech would win and the king would go 
sleep with a royal prostitute.

98
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,260
And the reason for that was it's the 
same idea as St George pulling the 

99
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,541
Virgin from the Dragon.
It's exactly the same idea that if you 

100
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,450
call,
if you encounter the reptilian chaos,

101
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:55,410
you can extract something out of it with
which if you unite,

102
00:04:55,411 --> 00:05:00,411
you produce creative order.
That's what they were acting out and 

103
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:02,190
that was the basis for the Mesopotamian 
idea of sovereignty.

104
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,430
It's so smart.
It's so unbelievably smart and know the 

105
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,241
Mesopotamians had a massive influence on
the civilizations that then had a 

106
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:14,721
massive influence on us.
It's one of the stories of how the 

107
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:17,580
notion of sovereignty itself came to be.
It's the evolution of the idea of God.

108
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,980
That's one way of thinking about it,
but even more importantly,

109
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:24,390
it's the evolution of the idea of the 
redemptive human being.

110
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,920
Right,
and that's taken to.

111
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:28,650
It's one of its conclusions while in the
story of Buddha,

112
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:33,651
but also in the story of Christ,
the idea of the perfect individual and 

113
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:33,651
the notion is,
well,

114
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:38,061
that's the word that speaks truth into 
chaos at the beginning of time to 

115
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:39,450
generate habitable order.
That is good.

116
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,420
That's the story,
and so with that,

117
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,170
let's see.

118
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,140
Oh sure.
I'll just show you these pictures 

119
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,140
because they're so interesting once you 
know what they mean.

120
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,800
They're so cool.
That's a symbol of infinity.

121
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,150
That's Hercules and the hydro.
Well,

122
00:05:58,151 --> 00:06:00,450
what slice?
Like cut off one head.

123
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,370
What happens?
Seven more.

124
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:03,600
Grow,
right?

125
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,200
Well,
what do you do?

126
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:05,370
Run home.
Well,

127
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:06,950
no,
that's not what you do it.

128
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,270
This is what you do.
You fight it.
