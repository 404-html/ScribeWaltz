1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
Pursue what is meaningful,
not was this expedient,

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,190
uh,
you,

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,240
you write in the book,
there is no faith and no courage and no 

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,601
sacrifice in doing what is expedient.
Why do you say to those of viewers that 

5
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:20,211
don't pursue their dreams and are locked
into their careers because they are too 

6
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:23,520
afraid to take risks and pursue 
something meaningful?

7
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,260
Well,
the first thing I would say is,

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,680
well,
you shouldn't be afraid of taking risks 

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,980
and pursuing something meaningful,
but you should be more afraid of staying

10
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:33,870
where you are.
If it's making you miserable,

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,200
it's like the first thing you want to do
is dispense with the idea that you get 

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,891
to have any,
any permanent security outside of your 

13
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:45,030
ability to contend and adapt.
It's the same issue with children.

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,510
It's like you're paying a price by 
sitting there being miserable and you 

15
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:50,510
might say,
well,

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,870
the devil I know is better than the one 
I don't.

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,970
It's like,
don't be so sure of that.

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,140
The clock is ticking and if you're 
miserable in your job now and you change

19
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,930
nothing in five years,
you'll be much more miserable and you'll

20
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:04,320
be a lot older.
But this is the luxury to pursue what is

21
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,540
meaningful.
Our viewers have worked with this.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,510
They have children,
they have payments in loans.

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,390
It's a luxury to pursue because we lack 
the resources.

24
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:13,230
Well,
I don't think.

25
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:15,630
I don't remember.
Now I'm not talking about what makes you

26
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:20,631
happy.
It's a luxury to pursue what makes you 

27
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:23,691
happy.
It's a moral obligation to pursue what 

28
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:24,660
you find meaningful and that doesn't 
mean it's easy.

29
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:28,410
It might require sacrifice.
If you need to change your job to,

30
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:32,370
let's say you have a family and children
and a mortgage,

31
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:37,371
you have responsibilities.
You've already picked up those 

32
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:40,761
responsibilities.
You don't just get to walk away Scott 

33
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:40,761
Free and say,
well,

34
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:40,761
I don't like my job.

35
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:42,420
I quit.
That's no strategy.

36
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,340
But what you might have to do is you 
think,

37
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:46,560
well,
this job is killing my soul or right?

38
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:48,480
So what do I have to do about that?
Well,

39
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:51,420
I have to look for another job while no 
one wants to hire me.

40
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,380
It's like,
okay,

41
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,190
maybe you need to educate yourself more.
Maybe you need to update your,

42
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,720
your curriculum,
veto,

43
00:01:57,721 --> 00:02:02,721
your resume.
Maybe you need to overcome your fear of 

44
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:05,781
being interviewed.
Maybe you need to sharpen your social 

45
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:09,321
skills like you.
You have to think about these things 

46
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:09,321
strategically.
If you're going to switch careers,

47
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:12,870
you have to do it like an intelligent,
responsible person that might take you a

48
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:14,230
couple of years of,
of,

49
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,500
of effort to do properly.
When you say pursue something 

50
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:19,500
meaningful,
is it important to have a vocation?

51
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,220
I think it's more important to to have a
an ethos and ethic,

52
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,570
so I have a program,
for example,

53
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:32,571
called the future authoring program,
which is a writing program that enables 

54
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:35,931
people to develop a vision for their 
life and then to develop a strategy and 

55
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:37,230
so it's based on the idea.

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,440
Imagine that and it's an extension of 
the ideas in the book or at least 

57
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,520
something along the same lines.
The first thing that you want to do is 

58
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,070
figure out.
Imagine you were taking care of yourself

59
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,800
like you were someone you cared for,
which is rule number two,

60
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,910
by the way,
essentially.

61
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,220
Then you should figure out,
well,

62
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,560
if you could have what you needed and 
wanted,

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,650
what would it be?
What sort of friends would you have?

64
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,970
What would your family relationships 
look like?

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,980
How would you conduct yourself with your
children?

66
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,150
How would you educate yourself?
You need to think through how it is that

67
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:12,151
your life could be properly arranged if 
you had that ability and then you can 

68
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:16,330
name it that,
and the funny thing is is that if you do

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,960
positive goal of that sort and work 
towards it,

70
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,470
you will move towards it.
The goal will change because you'll 

71
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:25,470
learn things along the way,
but I mean I've.

72
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,480
I've dealt with hundreds of people in my
clinical and consulting practice and we 

73
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,741
set a goal.
We develop a vision and work towards it 

74
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:34,741
and it,
it,

75
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:39,310
things inevitably get better for people.
So it's not a luxury.

76
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,390
It's,
it's difficult.

77
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,970
It's a moral responsibility and it isn't
happiness.

78
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:43,690
It's,
it's not.

79
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:47,030
The pursuit isn't for happiness.
It's a moral responsibility to push you.

80
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,550
What is meaningful.
Absolutely.
