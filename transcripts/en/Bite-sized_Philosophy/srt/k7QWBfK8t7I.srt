1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
Number five,
do not let your children do anything 

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,761
that makes you dislike them.
This is sorta been a through line to at 

3
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:07,761
least the beginning part of our council.
Well,

4
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:09,420
the first thing is it's the monster 
thing,

5
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:13,920
like the beauty and beast thing.
You are not a good guy and you will take

6
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:16,350
revenge on your children if they 
misbehave.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,630
You Think,
oh no,

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,930
I liked my children.
It's like other people might not like 

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,330
them.
Maybe they don't behave very well,

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,380
you know,
and you think you liked them because 

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,000
you're a saint,
but you're not and you will take revenge

12
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:33,030
on those children if they do things that
make you dislike them.

13
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:36,000
So you're in the grocery store and 
you've got a four year old and four year

14
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:41,001
olds,
pretty smart checking you out all the 

15
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:42,831
time and like poking you and prodding 
you and seeing what's there because 

16
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:42,831
that's what little kids do.

17
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:44,700
They're not that verbal.
So they are,

18
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:45,910
they're,
they're like,

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,110
they,
they,

20
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,530
they have.
You could compare their behavior in some

21
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:54,531
ways to pack animals like dogs,
which is why they like dogs and get 

22
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:54,780
along with dogs.
They understand each other,

23
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:59,781
you know,
and so they're testing out and so they 

24
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:00,480
have a temper tantrum in the store and 
you don't know what to do about it.

25
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,540
What you do,
your kid has a temper tantrum in the 

26
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:05,540
store.
You pick up the child,

27
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,531
you go outside with them,
you stand them up somewhere and just let

28
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,090
them have it.
Let them have the temper tantrum.

29
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:15,990
It's like they don't get sick of it.
Soon enough,

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,720
go somewhere boring and dull.
Say,

31
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:19,980
well,
have outer man.

32
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,260
Then the kids done.
You say,

33
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,020
we're going to stand right here until 
you decide that you're going to behave.

34
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,290
The child knows what that means is like,
you're going to behave or we're just 

35
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:32,290
gonna.

36
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:32,290
Stand here.
It's like,

37
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,330
fine,
okay.

38
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:35,250
You don't do that.
The child has a temper tantrum.

39
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,070
The third one,
you know you're embarrassed.

40
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:39,510
You're turning red.
Everyone's sweating.

41
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:41,520
Everyone's looking at you like you're a 
horrible parent.

42
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:43,530
It's like really unpleasant thing.
Oh,

43
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:45,300
I love my child.
I liked my child.

44
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:45,660
It's like,
no,

45
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:47,430
you don't.
That's a lie.

46
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,310
You go home,
the kids forgotten all about it.

47
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,170
You know,
they go in their room,

48
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:57,171
they make a little drawing,
they're all thrilled that they come out 

49
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:57,630
and show it to you and maybe they did a 
really good job.

50
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:02,631
You know,
maybe there are even a little guilty 

51
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:02,631
about having the Damn Tantrum,
but you,

52
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:03,270
man,
you're not happy and you think,

53
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,330
yeah,
that's nice and you go back to whatever 

54
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,600
useless thing you're doing and you think
I got that little bastard and you think,

55
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:10,560
no,
I wouldn't think that.

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,260
It's like you're wrong.
You're wrong.

57
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,450
Not only would you think that you would 
act it out,

58
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,660
and if you don't think that that's true,
then you don't know yourself very well 

59
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,620
and so you got to think.
Now a little kid is little and powerless

60
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,420
while not as powerless as you might 
think,

61
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,450
but fundamentally you got the upper hand
and you've got the proclivity for 

62
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:34,791
tyranny deeply rooted in you and so you 
better be real careful around that 

63
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:35,130
child.
I,

64
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,450
I used to tell my kids,
you know,

65
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:41,451
when I was not in a good mood,
he say like it would be better if you 

66
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:42,870
were in your room and they didn't mind.
They knew what it meant,

67
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,400
you know,
they were very young.

68
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:48,030
They could understand that.
It's like you're a fine kid,

69
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,900
you know,
pat,

70
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,530
Pat,
Pat,

71
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,710
I'm not in a good mood.
Things are likely to be unpleasant.

72
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,390
Why don't you just go play in your room 
for a while.

73
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,610
It's like way they went,
they knew how to play in their room,

74
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,300
you know,
because I didn't want them being around 

75
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:02,300
me.
I wasn't being going to be a good guy.

76
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,320
And so in Kim's faith,
they know they can handle that man,

77
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,380
they can't handle lies,
they can handle that sort of truth,

78
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,420
no problem.
And so like I,

79
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,460
both my wife and I,
we very careful.

80
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:16,330
It's like when we're starting to not be 
happy with the kids,

81
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,630
with one kid or the other,
it was time to have a chat and figure 

82
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,440
out what it was that had gone off the 
rails and how we were going to fix it.

83
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:25,840
So that we were like thrilled to have 
that kid around.

84
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,370
And that's the thing about kids is you 
can be thrilled to have them around.

85
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,810
Not always,
you're tired,

86
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,030
you're hung over like you've had a bad 
day.

87
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,150
The kids cranky.
Like I'm not saying this is utopia.

88
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,550
It's not.
That's not the point.

89
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,980
The point is though,
you,

90
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,170
you can manage your relationship with 
your kids and you can have an honest 

91
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,561
relationship with them and then it will 
be the best relationship with anybody 

92
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:49,561
you've ever had in your life.
