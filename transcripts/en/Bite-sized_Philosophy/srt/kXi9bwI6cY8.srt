1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,090
Carl jung talked about this phenomena,
he cried phenomenon,

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:12,210
he described as a retrogressive 
restoration of the persona and so it's a

3
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:24,331
complicated idea,
but basically what it means is that 

4
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:26,770
sometimes you take a leap forward and 
you learn some things,

5
00:00:26,771 --> 00:00:31,771
but you can't catalyze a new identity so
you try to go back and hide in your old 

6
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:35,701
identity and that actually doesn't work 
because while things have changed and 

7
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:39,910
you've learned something and that isn't 
who you are anymore,

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,780
and so it's like you have to cut part 
parts of yourself off in a destructive 

9
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,770
manner to fit back into the person that 
you were.

10
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,780
Now What happens here is that Pinocchio 
escapes from this tyrannical situation 

11
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,910
and undergoes this descend into chaos,
but he tries to go back home.

12
00:00:57,911 --> 00:01:01,660
He tries to go back to what he was and 
he can't do that anymore.

13
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,220
His father isn't at home anymore,
and so,

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,530
so when he goes home,
he finds that there's no home there.

15
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,350
Now this happens to people sometimes.
It's often a shock to them.

16
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:21,460
So one of the things I've noticed about 
Peter Pan type,

17
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,770
I'm going to speak about men here 
because I've observed it more in men,

18
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,260
is that they often stay under the thumb 
of their father and you think,

19
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:37,261
well why would someone do that?
Because it means they're subject to the 

20
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:41,701
tyrannical judgment of their father.
They're always concerned about what 

21
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:42,130
their father would think or whether 
their father approves of it,

22
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,670
of the and so forth.
And you think,

23
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:49,060
well that's gotta be an unpleasant place
to be.

24
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,480
Why would you do that?
One of the things that I've suggested to

25
00:01:55,331 --> 00:02:00,331
my clients and to other people sometimes
is that here's a weird little exercise 

26
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:02,650
that you can undertake.
A little thought experiment.

27
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,850
So you have your parents and of course 
your parents have friends who are about 

28
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,751
their age and maybe some of them are 
people you only know peripherally and I 

29
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:13,630
might ask you,
well,

30
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,630
do you care more about what your parents
think?

31
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,690
Then you care about what these 
peripheral people who know your parents 

32
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,180
think.
And then the answer to that is,

33
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:23,200
well,
of course.

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,810
And then the question that arises out of
that is

35
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,170
why,

36
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,970
I mean,
for someone else,

37
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:34,570
your parents are the peripheral people 
and their parents are central.

38
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Like why is it logical that your parents
make opinion makes any more difference 

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,930
to you than the appearance,
than the,

40
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,680
uh,
uh,

41
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:47,680
the opinion of some randomly selected 
people who are approximately that age.

42
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,310
Why is it the case that you would 
consider that they would know more than 

43
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:53,310
someone else?
I mean,

44
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:53,980
I know they know you better and fair 
enough,

45
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:58,981
but that that's not the point.
And then another point there is that the

46
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:04,201
degree that your parents opinion about 
you matters more than some randomly 

47
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:05,740
selected.
People have approximately the same age.

48
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,330
Young would say,
well,

49
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,970
you haven't exactly separated out the 
God,

50
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:13,420
the image from your parents.
And so you're still under that,

51
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,900
that combination.
It's like a complicated thing to talk 

52
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,400
about.
But think about the Harry Potter series.

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,110
Harry has two sets of parents,
right?

54
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:26,830
He's got the [inaudible] parents and 
then he's got these like magical parents

55
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,220
that sort of float behind and he should 
know the difference between them.

56
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,590
They shouldn't be one in the same,
they're not for him,

57
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,640
and it's like,
well,

58
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,660
you have your parents and you have 
nature and culture as parents and you 

59
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,780
shouldn't be thinking that your parents 
are nature and culture as well.

60
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,980
It shouldn't have final dominion over 
you means that you're not an individual.

61
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:46,060
Yet.
If that's the case.

62
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,590
Freud said,
for example,

63
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,630
that no,
no,

64
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,590
no one could be a man and less his 
father had died and young said,

65
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:58,591
yes,
but that death can take place 

66
00:03:58,591 --> 00:03:58,591
symbolically.
Okay,

67
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:02,281
so there's that part of the idea and 
then another part of the idea is one of 

68
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:07,661
the times in your life when you actually
realize that you're an individual is 

69
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:11,501
when you'll go and ask your parents 
something and you'll realize they 

70
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:11,501
actually don't know anymore about

71
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,080
what you should do.
Then you do,

72
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,780
and that sucks and that's partly why 
people are often willing to maintain a 

73
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,510
tyrant slave relationship with their 
father.

74
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,540
It's like on the one hand,
you have to be inferior in a 

75
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:26,740
relationship like that.
You know,

76
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:28,810
you've always got the judge watching 
you,

77
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,420
but another hand,
there's always someone who knows what to

78
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:36,421
do.
There's always someone standing between 

79
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:37,300
you and the unknown that you can go ask,
what should I do?

80
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,540
Well,
at some point you'll realize that the 

81
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:42,650
reason you can't ask that anymore is 
because they actually don't know anymore

82
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,750
than you do,
and then that's a pain like that.

83
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,790
That is a symbolic death.
Now it's also when you establish a more 

84
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,120
individual relationship with your 
parents,

85
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:57,230
it's at that point that you could 
conceivably start taking care of them 

86
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,420
instead of the reverse and that's a time
that should come,

87
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,070
but you have to let that image of 
perfection go and that exposes you.

88
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,140
Well,
that's what happens here.

89
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,290
You know,
Pinocchio goes home and he wants things 

90
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,071
to be the way they were and he wants to 
stay under the careful care of the 

91
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:16,900
benevolent father,
but that's no longer possible.

92
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:21,901
He's past that point and that's why the 
father has disappeared and so Japan has 

93
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:25,750
gone off to look for Pinocchio because 
he also needs Sun,

94
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,080
but,

95
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,920
but in any case,
the house is abandoned and so then we 

96
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,811
see inside the house that everything's 
covered with cobwebs and everything's 

97
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:39,950
Gone and Pinocchio and the cricket sit 
on the steps and they're very concerned.

98
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:45,010
First of all,
they wonder where he went so they're 

99
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,291
actually concerned that he's gone,
but they also don't know what to do 

100
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,261
because there's just no going home.
And so that's also the case that once 

101
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,790
you hit a certain point in your 
development,

102
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,580
well it's the same thing we already 
talked about.

103
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,840
The answers that looking for are not 
going to be found in your parents house.

104
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,380
It's as simple as that.
Now you could artificially maintain your

105
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,020
dependency,
but you know,

106
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,510
if you do that for too long,
things get pretty ugly.

107
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,520
So you get pretty stale and you know,
you're like bread that's been on the 

108
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:14,540
shelf for too long.
