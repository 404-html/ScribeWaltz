1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,680
Okay,
so anyways,

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:05,820
back to the equity thing of all the 
postures and idiotic ideas.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,300
So first of all,
to make gender equity across every 

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:11,940
dimension of a,
of a,

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,030
of an organization,
you have to assume that men and women 

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,370
have identical interests or,
and,

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,430
and temperaments,
and that if they don't,

8
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:23,280
the state should intervene to bloody 
well ensure that they do,

9
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:27,300
which is something for all you women to 
figure out because now there's many,

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,360
uh,
many what a positions in society that 

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,790
women preferentially occupied.
So what are you going to do about that 

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,420
and what are you going to do about the 
Asians because they occupied 

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:41,490
preferential positions as well.
You know,

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,570
they're overrepresented in all sorts of 
professional institutions and the 

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,190
probability is that that's going to 
increase.

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,490
What are you going to do about that?
What about the Jews are going to do 

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,251
about them because they have,
they're in the same position as they 

18
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:55,650
Asians going to put quotas on all those 
people.

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,490
What kind of stupidity is that?
And then it's worse too,

20
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:04,491
because let's say you equalize women and
accrued for just for the sake of 

21
00:01:04,491 --> 00:01:06,030
argument across all these different 
dimensions of society.

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,450
Well then what are you going to do it?
You're going to,

23
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,780
are you going to equalize for black 
women and Latino Women and Asian women?

24
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,050
Are you going to sub type black women 
because it's not like they're all the 

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,171
same.
Are you going to ensure that women from 

26
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:24,471
lower classes are are represented just 
as much as women from upper classes and 

27
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:27,060
how many generations back are you going 
to go to check that?

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,730
What about intelligence?
What about attractiveness?

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,890
How about height?
How about weight?

30
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,320
So the problem with the fractionation by
group identity is that it's endless.

31
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,710
There's no way of ensuring equality 
across groups because there's an 

32
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,250
infinite number of groups you can 
fragment group identity all the way down

33
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:47,370
into the level of the individual,
which is exactly what you should do.

34
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,500
Which is what we already did in the 
West.

35
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,000
We figured,
well,

36
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,960
the ultimate diverse population is a 
population of individuals.

37
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,210
So you let the individuals sorted out.
No,

38
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:58,840
no,
we're going to replace that with group.

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Well,
what that means for the bloody social 

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,051
activists is that they'll be able to 
play this game forever because you can 

41
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:09,291
continually fractioning group identity 
ad nauseum and so the system will never 

42
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:13,671
be equal and you can bloody well be sure
that as we implement social policy to 

43
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:19,011
make sure that all outcomes are equal,
but the amount of space that you 

44
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:22,341
personally are going to have to maneuver
in is going to shrink and shrink and 

45
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:25,881
shrink and shrink.
We've already seen that happen in many 

46
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:28,551
societies.
You think we would learn from the 20th 

47
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:28,551
century.
