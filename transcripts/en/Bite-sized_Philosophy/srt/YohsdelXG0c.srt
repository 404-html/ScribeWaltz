1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,400
Yep.
To sort of separate,

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,560
you were talking about being around 300 
million people,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,770
so why is,
why is a group of similar size,

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,170
which is America,
it really face.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,780
You think the right and left can talk to
each other.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,730
Do you think they speak the same 
language?

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:27,330
Right?
You see it that fragmenting occurring 

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,990
and they really are.
Not only are they speaking different 

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,150
languages,
they're speaking different languages.

10
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,100
It's the right way of thinking about it.
Yes,

11
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,390
it's very,
very dangerous.

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,150
You know,
I think the US worked for a long time,

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,910
first of all because it didn't always 
have 300 million people.

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,310
It's a lot of people to put under one 
umbrella.

15
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,310
Now the utility of the American system 
is that it is a hierarchy,

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,410
right?
There's individuals,

17
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:50,880
families,
towns,

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,500
states underneath a somewhat loose 
federal structure and that sort of.

19
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,650
So it's not a,
it's not a monolith where everyone has 

20
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:00,650
to speak precisely the same language.

21
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,510
It's got some flexibility built into its
structure because it's,

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,740
it's,
it's,

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,780
it's formulated into components which 
have a certain amount of autonomy and so

24
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:14,781
far that's worked sufficiently well.
Whether it will and it'll probably 

25
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:15,540
continue to work.
The Americans are a very,

26
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:20,541
very robust people and they've gone 
through things that are analogous to 

27
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,620
what they're going through now.
Many times God only knows,

28
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,160
right?
But,

29
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,610
but it's very dangerous thing to presume
that the Americans are down for the 

30
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,291
count because they have an uncanny 
ability to rise from the ashes even 

31
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:36,801
stronger than they were before.
But you can certainly see the danger 

32
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:36,801
lurking in Europe.
That's,

33
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,020
that's a different thing.
Like I think the European state is 

34
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,531
doomed because I think it grew too fast 
and it's severed that connection between

35
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,630
like there's not the proper hierarchy 
of,

36
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,910
of identification.
So.

37
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:51,960
And people are saying,
wait,

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,150
right Brussels,
like who the hell are you guys?

39
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,840
Why are you making decisions for us?
And we don't agree with your decisions.

40
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,170
And like are you sure that Greece and 
Germany can be in the same place?

41
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,690
Because that's by no means self evident.
Right.

42
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,830
The Germans aren't very happy about it 
and the Greeks aren't very happy about 

43
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,891
it.
And one of the rules for making an 

44
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,441
organization is that it's a lot easier 
to make a functional organization worse 

45
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:17,940
than it is to make a dysfunctional 
organization better.

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,710
And so you might say,
well,

47
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:24,711
you've got Germany and France and 
England while let's say Germany and 

48
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:25,320
France powerhouses,
especially Germany,

49
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,420
they can afford to bring Greece in.
Well maybe,

50
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,320
but there's no evidence that they can 
afford it.

51
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,930
So I mean,
Greece is unbelievably corrupt.

52
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,360
No one pays her income tax.
That's a big problem,

53
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,420
right?
And bringing them in to a union at a 

54
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,190
high order has no effect whatsoever on 
the micro behaviors.

55
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,550
And the thing is the micro behaviors 
have to be rectified and no one really 

56
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,821
knows how to do that.
How do you stop a country where people 

57
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:58,161
don't pay their taxes from?
How do you stop the people from not 

58
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,770
paying their taxes?
Why do we pay our taxes?

59
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,770
Who knows?
We could just all of a sudden decide not

60
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:07,771
to.
The government wouldn't have the 

61
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:08,230
resources to run around gathering them 
all up for one reason or another.

62
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:13,231
It's become customary for people in 
functional Western democracies to pay 

63
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:14,800
their taxes,
but why,

64
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,540
who knows?
It would have been way easier for us 

65
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:21,540
just to do what the Greeks did and 
pretend to pay them,

66
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,270
you know,
so there are too big I think.

67
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,890
And so the people on the right is saying
back to the nation and like I understand

68
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:30,870
why they're doing that,
but,

69
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,740
but the danger is the nation will 
subordinate the individual and I do see 

70
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:40,750
it as another example of safe spaces.

71
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,660
It's just scales different.
So.

72
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,190
And that's why I think that the proper 
antidote to that,

73
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:51,820
to both the chaos on the left and the 
order on the right roughly speaking,

74
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:53,650
is to walk the proper line in the 
middle.

75
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,590
I wouldn't,
we better do that because things are not

76
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,450
things that are too chaotic at the 
moment.

77
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,160
So it's not good.
Maybe it's really good that's possible.

78
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,610
But we're in a state where I really 
believe we're in a state where things 

79
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,930
could go any number of ways and there's 
no,

80
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,700
there's no predicting it.
So.

81
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:14,170
And I've never felt that,
you know,

82
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,970
I mean,
I lived in the eighties and you know,

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,290
political correctness rose up in the 
nineties as well,

84
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,200
and I can remember a lot of what 
happened in the early seventies with the

85
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:28,201
oil crisis and all that.
So there were times when things were 

86
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,320
shaky but they weren't shaking the way 
they are now.

87
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,930
They're an internal shakiness rather 
than something that was a threat that 

88
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,110
was,
seemed to be imposed from the outside.

89
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,340
And that's different.
And,

90
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,380
and it's,
it's,

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,270
it's,
it's,

92
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,630
it is associated with,
with this intellectual war that's going 

93
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,960
on with postmodernism in new Marxism and
all of that as well.

94
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:47,590
So.
