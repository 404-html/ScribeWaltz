1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,860
I've been trying to think about the 
story of Sodom and Gomorrah in 

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,910
relationship to modern sexual confusion,

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,710
so this is what I see happening on the 
social justice front,

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,630
let's say on the one hand since the 19 
sixties and probably as a consequence of

5
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:20,330
the birth control pill,
but other factors as well.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,570
There's been tremendous stress placed on
sexual liberation and so there's this 

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,521
idea that I think is associated in large
part right now with the radical left of 

8
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:35,831
total sexual freedom,
but at the same time there's increasing 

9
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:41,231
emphasis from exactly the same sources 
on restricting sexual interaction.

10
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,900
So you see this in the campuses,
for example,

11
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:49,901
where increasingly particularly 
heterosexual contact is regulated by a 

12
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:55,091
doctrine that says you have to get 
spoken permission for every move in the 

13
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:58,790
mating process.
And so you see,

14
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,450
and I know I'm not expressing myself 
very well,

15
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:04,310
but there seems to be in our current 
culture,

16
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:06,650
there seems to be massive sexual 
confusion.

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,220
It's,
it's some weird combination of extreme 

18
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,831
libertinism and extreme authoritarian 
attitudes towards sexuality and and 

19
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,740
obviously in the story of Sodom.
Part of what's happening happening and 

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,630
is that sex impulsive?
Sexual gratification trumps everything.

21
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:32,321
It's something like that.
I mean I know there's more to what's 

22
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:32,930
going on in Sodom than that,
but there's certainly that and so.

23
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,730
Well,
I'm trying to figure out what to say 

24
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,730
about that tonight because there's a.
there's a lesson in there.

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,970
The lesson is something like,

26
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,930
don't let sexuality,
don't let impulsive sexuality get the 

27
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,441
upper hand.
It's something like that or all hell 

28
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,691
will break loose,
which I actually happen to agree with 

29
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:58,380
because one of the things that we 
haven't been able to talk about in our 

30
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,811
culture I think is let's take the idea 
of the phenomena of aids aids mutated to

31
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:06,970
take advantage of promiscuous sexuality 
and that's just nothing.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,060
You never hear that publicized.
You know,

33
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,660
people had associated aids with 
homosexuality and there was a reason for

34
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:18,661
that because it's much more easily 
transmitted as a consequence of 

35
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:21,301
homosexual sex than heterosexual sex 
because the anus is a much more delicate

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,240
physiological structure.
It's not as robust and it can be much 

37
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,721
more easily damaged and and,
and with with disease resulting as a 

38
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:35,311
consequence,
but it isn't only the manner of sexual 

39
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:35,311
action.
That's the issue,

40
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:40,201
it's also the fact that promiscuity 
provided the evolutionary platform for 

41
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:45,421
the aids virus to mutate into a very 
into the form that it finally took and 

42
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:49,681
it was only through by the skin of our 
teeth that we escaped a totalizing 

43
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:50,940
plague.
You know,

44
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,950
had that emerged 100 years ago.
God only knows how many people would 

45
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:58,000
have died.
It was.

46
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:03,001
AIDS was unbelievably so.
I know that's a mishmash of ideas and 

47
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:07,450
I'm not exactly sure how to see my way 
clear through it,

48
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,450
but there is a clear warning in that 
story about,

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,650
about something,
about something to do with,

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,060
with,
with sexual inequity,

51
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,240
but in the Bible that sexuality has to 
two Poles that define it and it's pretty

52
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:26,410
clear.
One,

53
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,100
what inside is reproduction and the 
other side is we could,

54
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,760
let's say Rick Creation.
Okay,

55
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,230
so those are the two poles of sexuality 
in a normal word.

56
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,850
So it's not just for reproduction and 
it's not just for recreation.

57
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,880
It's both.
You're right.

58
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,150
That was the idea.
I mean,

59
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:47,980
it's a natural idea.
Now,

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,040
if you,
if there's a balance there that should 

61
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,210
be had,
if you lose this balance and they become

62
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,430
just about reproduction,
that's a problem and they fed.

63
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:01,420
It becomes just about recreation.
That's another problem.

64
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,480
Yup.
Okay.

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,800
It's not that complicated really,
but it's so politically incorrect to 

66
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,650
talk about these things even though 
they're obvious.

67
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,840
Well that nobody dares you talk about 
it.

68
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,070
The thing is is that the most difficult 
things to talk about are the things that

69
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:19,240
are obvious because when they're obvious
you don't have to talk about them and so

70
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:21,430
then when people start to question the 
obvious,

71
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,660
you don't know what to say,
so.

72
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,720
So for example,
we would.

73
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,810
I'm thinking about the slut walks and so
women go out and they dress very 

74
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:36,811
provocatively and they go out and 
manifest their right to be as 

75
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:39,700
provocative as they possibly can be 
without being interfered with.

76
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,420
And I have some sympathy for that 
perspective because it seems to me 

77
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,790
appropriate for women to be.
The final arbiter is in sexual contact,

78
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,500
but on the other hand,
it also,

79
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,330
it's that whole exercise is blind to the
fact that clothing,

80
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,460
for example,
has communicative intent

81
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,160
and that

82
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,240
people broadcast their invitation to 
sexual congress in a million ways,

83
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:08,750
subtle and not so subtle,
and you can't just say,

84
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,080
I have the right to broadcast myself in 
any manner possible and be completely,

85
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,190
um,

86
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:17,840
can,
can,

87
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,810
can be completely immune from the 
consequences.

88
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,870
There's something wrong with that.
And with regards to basic sexual 

89
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:25,870
morality,
no,

90
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,120
I've read things about like slut shaming
is that the more radical feminist types,

91
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:36,851
for example,
claim that women shouldn't be held 

92
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:37,190
responsible for their sexual behavior in
some sense.

93
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,560
It shouldn't be held against them.
How many men they've slept with,

94
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,240
et cetera.
But then I think,

95
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,900
well,
you'd never recommend to someone that 

96
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,691
they laid down naked on the,
on the side of the street with their 

97
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:52,691
legs spread and invite anybody who walks
by to partake of the opportunity.

98
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,330
Everyone would regard that as 
inappropriate,

99
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,020
I think without question.
And so what that indicates is that some 

100
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,270
degree of sexual propriety is both 
normative,

101
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,310
unethical.
And then of course you can start asking 

102
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,301
yourself about what that degree of 
social sexual propriety should be.

103
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,670
And it does have something to do with 
getting the balance between reproduction

104
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:18,350
and recreation.
Right?

105
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,370
Well,
the thing is,

106
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,740
even in the Bible,
there's the two aspects.

107
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:30,950
Some stories are about just this aspect 
in.

108
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,020
There are the most strange stories in 
the Bible.

109
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,320
For example,
the story of Tamar is one of those.

110
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,710
So,
uh,

111
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,470
I don't know if you're familiar with 
that story,

112
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,450
but it's tough.
It's in the,

113
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:49,451
it's,
it's intercut with the story of Joseph 

114
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:53,620
in Egypt and it's essentially a,
it says that Judah had children with 

115
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:00,530
some woman and I think it's a stranger.
It doesn't necessarily say so,

116
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:02,690
but it,
it seems like that's what it is.

117
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,810
And then the sons die off.
And then there's this woman called Tamar

118
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:11,600
and she disguises herself as a 
prostitute.

119
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,660
Great.
And she has a kid with Judah himself.

120
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,600
So all of the symbols heard that story.

121
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,260
Elements of his clothing.
Yeah.

122
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:23,660
Damage

123
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,240
as a,
as a bride.

124
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:26,230
Yeah.
Essentially

125
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,730
he wants to indicate later that he's the
one who slept with.

126
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,410
Yeah,
yeah,

127
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,730
yeah.
So that story is about the necessity,

128
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:38,600
the need for the recreative part of 
sexuality.

129
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,750
It's all about that symbolism.
It's all about the seat.

130
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,260
It's all about incest,
it's all about death and it's the idea 

131
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:50,960
is it's to raise the dead.
Okay.

132
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:53,080
It's not clear in the story,
but if you understand,

133
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,860
if you understand the imagery,
that's what it's about.

134
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,160
It's about regressing back to an error 
that was made.

135
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,810
Okay.
And raising the dead.

136
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,440
So I don't want to get into it.
But it's just the idea that in the Bible

137
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:11,441
there's both to the hearse reproduction 
and there's recreation and the 

138
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:16,100
recreation is renewal.
There's the renewal.

139
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:20,290
Sexuality is about renewal too.
But that aspect of the symbolism is,

140
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,020
is pretty.
I don't want to say obscure because it's

141
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:28,130
actually right there if you can see it,
but it's strange.

142
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:28,940
I'll say it like that.

143
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,710
Strange.
Okay.

144
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,750
So now another element of this might be 
the fact that in modern identity 

145
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,371
politics,
sexual choice is a canonical identifier 

146
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:42,810
and that also seems to me to be 
something wrong about that.

147
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,960
Like one of the things I've seen 
happening in Toronto,

148
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,510
I'm sure it's the same in Montreal,
is that,

149
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,890
and I'm going to do this awkwardly,
I'm going to put this awkwardly because 

150
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,800
I haven't been able to sort through it 
properly.

151
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,200
Um,
pride week,

152
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,430
Pride Day has turned into pride week and
that's turned into pride month and I 

153
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,511
think that seems to me to be pushing 
against some kind of limit because the 

154
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:13,011
first question that I have is like I was
reading this book the other day by a 

155
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:17,571
friend of mine from Ottawa who's a gay 
conservative and he said he had a lot 

156
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:22,671
harder time coming out as a conservative
then he had as coming out as gay and he 

157
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:29,301
talked about the degree to which 
homosexuals were persecuted in Canada 

158
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,860
before say the 19 eighties.
And it's quite,

159
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,300
it makes quite a harsh reading,
let's say.

160
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,950
And so and so fair enough to the,
to the civil rights movement,

161
00:09:46,491 --> 00:09:47,360
let's say it,
that,

162
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,800
that has brought homosexuality into the 
norm or that into the mainstream.

163
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,300
Maybe that's one way of thinking about 
it,

164
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,620
but that conversation still has a 
tremendous amount of development.

165
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,270
That's necessary because I don't 
understand exactly,

166
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,040
it isn't obvious to me what integration 
into the mainstream precisely means 

167
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,090
because a lot,
there's been a lot of talk so far about

168
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,680
respecting the rights of gay people,
but very little talk about what the 

169
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,030
accompanying responsibilities might be.
Not Actually,

170
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:25,170
it seems to me to be a problem and I 
mean I just had a letter from,

171
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,620
from Guy Gay guy who has been wrestling 
with this because he's not sure how to 

172
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:34,260
be gay and to be ethical at the same 
time,

173
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,380
you know,
because he sees part of normative 

174
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,541
behavior is taking wife and having 
children and not and can see the value 

175
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:45,201
in that,
but that's certainly not the direction 

176
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:45,201
of his proclivity.
And so we wrote,

177
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:49,110
wrote to me asking me what he should do 
and you know,

178
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,140
I don't have an answer for that.
I don't know what the answer to that is,

179
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,580
but I know that it might be something 
that would be worth talking about and 

180
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,190
it's part of this current confusion 
about sexual identity and sexual 

181
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,010
pleasure and,
and well even gender identity for that 

182
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,010
matter.
So.

183
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,770
All right,
so your idea was,

184
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:15,000
well the balance between recreation and 
reproduction had gone,

185
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,370
was completely absent inside of it was 
all recreation.

186
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,620
It was all instant gratification.
Impulse.

187
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,820
Yeah.
And that's why it's put in contrast with

188
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,750
the Abraham bit because it's the same 
angels,

189
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,360
but in that case he,
he says you'll have a son this time next

190
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,330
year,
so it's the reproduction part is there,

191
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,940
but when he gets to the bottom,
it's not there anymore.

192
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,400
It's only the recreation part.
Okay.

193
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,180
So yeah,
so they're,

194
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:46,880
they're,
they're meant to be contested.

195
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:51,230
Those two stores actually in the story 
of Abraham,

196
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,770
it's pretty clear he,
I don't know if this will make sense 

197
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,830
because when the angels come it,
it says,

198
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,970
um,
he washes their feet and then he feeds 

199
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,510
them.
Okay.

200
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,680
That's actually the recreation and 
reproduction part that not in terms of 

201
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:16,141
sexuality,
but it's in terms of meaning the 

202
00:12:16,141 --> 00:12:20,550
renewal,
the washing of the feet is the 

203
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,550
recreation part,
their renewal,

204
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,610
they're restarting and the feeding is 
the reproduction part.

205
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,720
Not,
not in a sexual way,

206
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:28,390
but when you feed something food and he 
eats it,

207
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:30,550
it integrates,
it integrates it correctly.

208
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,310
That's like our reproduction of your 
identity,

209
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:36,580
your you're staying yourself,
you're reproducing yourself,

210
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,260
so when you eat food,
that's what you're doing.

211
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,090
Not like I said,
not in a sexual way,

212
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:45,091
but it has the exactly the same.
Meaning if you eat something that you 

213
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:47,590
can integrate correctly,
you're reproducing your pattern.

214
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,810
It's like the correct version of 
yourself.

215
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,290
The other side,

216
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,740
the washing is like,
is little flood

217
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,710
the fuck.
So many flood,

218
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,120
right?
It also is an acceptable.

219
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,930
It's a controlled one.
You're washing the dust off the roads,

220
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:05,890
dust off your feet.
It means that you're.

221
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:11,200
You're passing from one mode of being 
into another because you're.

222
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,830
You're cleaning off the debris of the 
past.

223
00:13:13,831 --> 00:13:17,010
It's something like that and it's about 
renewal next.

224
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,950
Okay,
so you have to see that when,

225
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,310
when,
when matthew was talking about,

226
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:21,450
yeah,
and you have recreation,

227
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,170
you have to understand that recreation 
and rest are basically the same thing.

228
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,940
Then you basically have the same 
meaning.

229
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:31,941
It's sleeping.
Resting recreation are all things that 

230
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:33,600
bring you into renewal.
Okay,

231
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,320
bye.

232
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,340
And dying.
That's what dying is.

233
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,460
It's passing into another state letting 
something else have a chance.

234
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,950
That's quit tying is it's then.
