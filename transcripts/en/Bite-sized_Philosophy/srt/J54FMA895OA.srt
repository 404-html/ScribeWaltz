1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,510
Well,
now I'm going to tell you this story.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,080
It's written for four year old kids,
but I want you to take a look at it for 

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,161
a moment,
from a different perspective and see if 

4
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:13,280
you can imagine exactly what it is that 
it's saying.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,230
There's no such thing as a dragon.
Well,

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,190
we all know that,
right?

7
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:26,250
A dragon is a fictitious creature,
reptilian,

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,650
terrible lives forever,
breathes fire hordes,

9
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:35,400
gold,
strange combination of attributes.

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,180
Why would something terrible and 
ancient?

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,080
Hold a treasure.
Billy [inaudible] was rather surprised 

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,370
when he woke up one morning and found a 
dragon in his room.

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,890
It was a small dragon about the size of 
a kitten.

14
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,010
The dragon wagged it's tail happily.
When billy patted his head.

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,670
It's interesting,
you know,

16
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:11,671
in Chinese mythology,
dragon is a positive figure in European 

17
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:17,851
mythology.
The dragon is something to face in 

18
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:20,281
combat and destroy or something to face 
in combat and build something out of the

19
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:26,071
pieces leftover from the Dragon.
Billy went downstairs to tell his mother

20
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,650
no such thing as a dragon said,
billy's mother,

21
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,890
and she said it like she meant it.
Remember once my daughter had a 

22
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,520
nightmare.
She was about four,

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,360
this was at the time when she first 
started to notice graffiti and litter 

24
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,970
and both graffiti and let her bothered 
her.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
She couldn't understand the motivations 
behind the graffiti artists and she 

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,241
didn't like the fact that there was 
litter cluttering up the world's order 

27
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:57,710
and the reason she got sensitive to that
as a child was because children are 

28
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,230
really,
really dependent on order.

29
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:58,830
Right.
I mean,

30
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,890
and the reason for that is that their 
realm of competence is rather 

31
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:03,890
restricted.
So they'd like to see things.

32
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,120
Mac messed up.
So little kids for example,

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,810
they're not happy with you if you play a
game with them and then mess around with

34
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:11,460
the rules of the game.
They don't like that at all.

35
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,110
They think that that's immoral activity 
to shake up the structure of the game.

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,840
Well anyways,
while she was pondering all this,

37
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,990
she uh,
came into our bedroom one night and 

38
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:23,990
said,
Dad,

39
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:23,990
I had a nightmare.
Now we all know,

40
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,140
right?
Nightmares aren't real.

41
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:27,450
Just like dragons,
dreams aren't real.

42
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,630
Of course.
Which raises the question of why in the 

43
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,611
world you'd bother having them six or 
seven hours a night every single day of 

44
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:38,571
your life and why they're a recognized 
feature of animal behavior all the way 

45
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:41,250
down to the amphibian level.
She said,

46
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:43,560
I dreamt that there was a clear flowing 
stream,

47
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,430
but in this dream there was all sorts of
garbage and it scared me and bothered me

48
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:48,390
so much.
I woke up,

49
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:49,440
so I told her,
look,

50
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,030
close your eyes and imagine the stream.
It's full of garbage.

51
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,290
What should you do about it?

52
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,400
She said,
well,

53
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:57,930
I should take the garbage out to the 
street.

54
00:02:57,931 --> 00:02:58,590
And I said,
all right,

55
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:03,591
so picture this stream.
Picture yourself cleaning the garbage 

56
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:05,230
out of it.
She calmed down and went back to sleep.

57
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,250
Why?
Well,

58
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:11,251
because dreams concentrate on threat.
We know that they present threats to 

59
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:15,571
you,
threats you haven't been able to deal 

60
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:15,571
with.
Well,

61
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:18,000
there's a part of your brain that tracks
threats and it's not really all that 

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,130
smart.
In some ways.

63
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,750
All it does is say,
look,

64
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,050
here's the problem and it's waiting for 
the rest of your brain to conjure up 

65
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,411
some solution to that problem and if it 
doesn't conjure up a solution and it 

66
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:31,090
just presents the problem over and over 
and over and over and over,

67
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,430
so people who have posttraumatic stress 
disorder,

68
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:38,431
for example,
who've been really upset by their 

69
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:40,801
contact with something unexpected,
dream about the same tragedy forever 

70
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:45,390
until they solve it and they solve it by
facing it and living it over and over 

71
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,860
voluntarily,
so you might think right off the bat 

72
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,531
from listening to that little story that
suggesting to your four year old 

73
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:57,910
daughter who's just had a nightmare that
her fears aren't real and that the dream

74
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:02,911
representation of them isn't real 
because it's not tangible like a table 

75
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:04,480
might not really be the best approach to
the problem.

76
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,190
So you see billy,
he's pretty much got it right,

77
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:10,300
right off the bat,
right?

78
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,760
The dragon wagged his tail happily.
When billy padded it's head,

79
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,360
Bailey went downstairs to tell his 
mother,

80
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,780
there's no such thing as a dragon said,
billy's mother,

81
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:24,781
and she said it like she meant it,
so there's a dragon in this house.

82
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,780
Now the next thing you might wonder is 
how often have you actually gone into a 

83
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,771
house where there's a dragon?
My guess is if you don't take this 

84
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:38,491
particularly specifically and allow 
yourself to use your imagination and to 

85
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:42,571
think metaphorically for a moment,
you've all encountered dozens of houses 

86
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:44,680
that were filled right to the rafters 
with various dragons,

87
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:50,010
all of which were being studiously 
ignored by the people who inhabited the 

88
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,480
house.
Billy went back to his room and began to

89
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:55,690
dress the dragon,
came close to billy in a friendly manner

90
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,820
and wagged his tail,
but billy didn't pat it.

91
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,880
If there is no such thing as something,
it's silly to patted on the head.

92
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,910
Merely washed his face and hands and 
went down to breakfast.

93
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,160
The dragon went along.
It was bigger.

94
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,800
Now,
almost the size of a dog.

95
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,170
Billy sat down at the table.
The dragon sat down on the table.

96
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,150
This sort of thing was not usually 
permitted,

97
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:24,370
but there wasn't much billy's mother 
could do about it.

98
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,730
She'd already said there was no such 
thing as a dragon head.

99
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:32,731
If there's no such thing,
you can't tell it to get down off the 

100
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:36,211
table.
Sometimes I sit with friends of mine who

101
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:40,470
had very young children to eat,
say,

102
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,750
and the children,
two or three years old,

103
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,530
don't sit at the table.
They sit on the table or they run around

104
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:50,620
the table or they run around the table 
and pull things off the table,

105
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,890
or they run around the house and pull 
things off all the shelves in the house 

106
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,430
and keep their parents so busy chasing 
them around that they have no time 

107
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,220
whatsoever to interact as adults.
Well,

108
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,370
you have to wonder under those 
circumstances whether you're dealing 

109
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,490
with a child or a dragon,
so to speak,

110
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,670
and you also might wonder whether or not
the dragon is large and unruly,

111
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,090
precisely because the parents are 
completely unwilling to admit that it 

112
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:19,090
actually exists.

113
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,210
Mother made some pancakes for billy,
what the dragon ate them all.

114
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,500
Mother made some more,
but to dragon eight,

115
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:32,920
those two mother kept making pancakes 
until she ran out of batter.

116
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,130
Billy only got one of them,
but he said that's all he really wanted.

117
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:37,840
Anyway,
one time,

118
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,150
ah,

119
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,370
an acquaintance of ours in Boston 
brought their son over to be Babysat at 

120
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,470
our house and his nanny had just been in
a car accident.

121
00:06:50,471 --> 00:06:52,240
So he was being shunted from house to 
house.

122
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:54,790
Well,
his parents went off to work and uh,

123
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,740
he didn't have very good reputation.
This kid,

124
00:06:56,741 --> 00:07:01,741
he was about four and a,
he came over to our house and with his 

125
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:06,080
mother in the morning and she dropped 
them off and she said,

126
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,110
well,
he probably won't eat all day,

127
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:11,300
but that's all right.
And I thought,

128
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,690
no,
he's four.

129
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,850
If he doesn't eat all day,
that's not all right.

130
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,880
Right.
Because kids,

131
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:22,010
if they don't eat their basically 
horrible,

132
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:22,850
right?
They don't sleep,

133
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,840
they don't eat,
they're horrible.

134
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,820
So it isn't all right that he doesn't 
eat.

135
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:26,570
So then you think,
well,

136
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,080
maybe there's some sort of dragon 
associated with this child that happens 

137
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,110
to be interviewing perhaps with his 
ability to eat.

138
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,500
So I came back at noon,
my wife had taken care of the children 

139
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,440
that day and I walked in the house and 
the other four or five kids that we had 

140
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,840
in house or off playing in this little 
kid was standing in the corner,

141
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,280
like really isolated and looking,
you know,

142
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,020
upset fundamentally.
So I went over and I poked him a bunch 

143
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,300
because generally if you poke a kid a 
little bit,

144
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:55,130
you know,
they'll go like this,

145
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:56,450
you know,
the sort of back off,

146
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:59,750
but sooner or later you can crack them 
and they'll smile and then they'll play.

147
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:00,650
Not this kid,
boy,

148
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:02,150
there's no bloody way who's going to 
play with me.

149
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:07,151
And that was that like he'd already 
learned that adults should either be 

150
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:11,891
ignored or that they were trouble and he
wasn't going to let any adults into his 

151
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:16,421
little world.
So there is absolutely a dragon 

152
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:17,330
associated with that little boy.
And it was eating all his pancakes.

153
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,220
The only went upstairs to brush his 
teeth.

154
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Mothers started clearing the table.
The dragon who was quite as big as 

155
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,821
mother by this time,
made himself comfortable in the whole 

156
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:32,120
rug and went to sleep.
I really liked this one.

157
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,260
By the time billy came back downstairs,
the dragon had grown so much.

158
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:41,261
He filled the hall.
Then we had to go around by way of the 

159
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:41,261
living room to get to where his mother 
was.

160
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,580
I didn't know.
Dragons grew so fast.

161
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,890
Said Billy,
there's no such thing as a dragon.

162
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:47,060
Said mother firmly

163
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,560
winning the downstairs.
Took mother all morning what?

164
00:08:55,561 --> 00:09:00,561
With the dragon in the way and having to
climb in and out of windows to get from 

165
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:00,561
room to room.
So you know,

166
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,390
you think back in your own experience 
when you've gone to a house where 

167
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,141
there's a dragon hiding underneath the 
living room rug and nobody's saying 

168
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:12,801
anything about it and then you think,
how long does it take to get something 

169
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:16,500
absolutely simple.
Done in a house that's absolutely jammed

170
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:19,800
to the rafters with unfinished business 
forever,

171
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:24,801
right?
Organizing people in a household like 

172
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:27,081
that to even do something as simple as 
go out for breakfast in the morning or 

173
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:28,770
even perhaps to make a meal is virtually
impossible.

174
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,840
Why?
Well,

175
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:35,841
because there's something going on in 
the household that has been studiously 

176
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:40,401
ignored for a very long time and has 
grown so large as a consequence that it 

177
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:45,441
occupies the whole domain.
By noon,

178
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,950
the dragon filled the house,
its head hung out the front door,

179
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:55,951
it's tail hung out the back door,
and there wasn't a room in the house 

180
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:55,990
that didn't have some part of the dragon
in it.

181
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,890
When the dragon awoke from his nap,
he was hungry.

182
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,680
The bakery truck went by.
The smell of fresh bread was more than 

183
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,671
the dragon could resist.
He ran down the street after the bakery 

184
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:14,671
truck.
The house went along,

185
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:16,210
of course like the shell on a snail.

186
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,650
The mailman was just coming up the path 
with some mail for the big speeds.

187
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:32,490
When their house rush past him and 
headed down the street,

188
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,470
he chased the big speed house for a few 
blocks,

189
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:35,970
but he but he couldn't catch it.

190
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,910
When Mr Bixby came home for lunch,
the first thing he noticed was that his 

191
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,400
house was gone.
Luckily one of the neighbors was able to

192
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:49,260
tell them which way it went.
You know,

193
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,040
that sort of thing happens to people not
infrequently to write,

194
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,100
hey,
they're not really looking around much 

195
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,920
at what's going on and they come home 
from work one day and their house is 

196
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,650
gone and what does that mean?
Well,

197
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:06,651
maybe their children have become 
completely alienated from them or maybe 

198
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:10,050
their wife has decided suddenly,
but of course not.

199
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,900
So suddenly to leave.
Why?

200
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,210
Well,
according to this story,

201
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:18,360
it's because something ignored was 
growing in the house.

202
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,610
Mr [inaudible] got in his car and went 
looking for the house.

203
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,740
He studied all the houses as he drove 
along.

204
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,590
Finally he saw one that looked familiar.
Billy and Mrs.

205
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,570
Bixby,
we're waving from an upstairs window,

206
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,130
you know,
in in the eighties and nineties in India

207
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:45,210
when our house was being built,
the local priest equivalent to the 

208
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:50,411
priest would come by to set the 
foundation stone and when he set the 

209
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:54,191
foundation stone,
he take a big spike and drove it into 

210
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:58,050
the ground and the reason he drove it 
into the ground at the place where the 

211
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,040
foundation was going to be laid was to 
keep the great dragon that is underneath

212
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:05,041
the earth,
firmly pinned down by its head so it 

213
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:05,830
couldn't move and shake the house to 
bits.

214
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,660
And what does that mean?
Well,

215
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,260
it means the same thing that's meant in 
the new testament when you're told not 

216
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,360
to build your house on a foundation of 
sand,

217
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:18,390
right?
It doesn't matter how good the house is 

218
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:18,790
or how well constructed it is or how 
rich it is.

219
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:23,020
If the foundation is made out of sand or
if it rests on top of a dragon,

220
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,050
there's nothing in that household that's
ever going to be accomplished.

221
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,730
That's positive and the wealth,
the display that the house might consist

222
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:35,731
of is nothing but a sham.
Mr [inaudible] climbed over the dragon's

223
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:39,650
head onto the porch roof and through the
upstairs window.

224
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,540
How did this happen?
Mr Bixby asked.

225
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,450
It was the dragon said,
billy,

226
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,870
there's no such thing.
Mother started to say,

227
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,140
there is a dragon.
Billy insisted a very big dragon,

228
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,420
and billy padded the dragon on the head.

229
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,410
The dragon wagged his tail happily.
Then even faster than it had grown.

230
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,620
The dragons started getting smaller 
soon.

231
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:13,410
It was kitten sized.

232
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:13,800
Yeah,

233
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,860
I don't mind dragons this side said,
mother,

234
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,080
why did it have to grow so big?
I'm not sure he said billy,

235
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:32,090
but I think it just want it to be 
noticed.
