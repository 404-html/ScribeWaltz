1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,250
Final rule,
that's called pet a cat when you 

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:07,620
encounter one on the street and it's.
It's a very.

3
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:10,380
It's the most personal chapter in the 
book.

4
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:15,000
It's a lot about my daughter and my 
daughter was very ill when she was,

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,120
when she was a kid,
but particularly when she was a 

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,120
teenager.
She had a very terrible time of it.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,730
She had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis 
and when she was between the ages of 14 

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,171
and 16 at first destroyed her hip,
which had to be replaced and then it 

9
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:33,441
destroyed the ankle on her other leg 
which had to be replaced and she walked 

10
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:38,781
around for two years on broken legs and 
she was taking massive doses of opiates 

11
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:43,581
and could hardly stay awake and like.
And she had this advanced auto immune 

12
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:47,631
disease which produced all sorts of 
other symptoms that were just as bad as 

13
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,750
the joint degeneration but which are 
harder to describe.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,720
And so it was just bloody brutal,
you know,

15
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:56,721
and as a test of your faith,
there's almost nothing that's more 

16
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:59,940
direct than a serious illness inflicted 
upon an innocent child.

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,970
Right.
And so the chapter is a meditation on 

18
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:04,970
that.
And also on,

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,880
well what to do in a situation like that
because everyone is going to have a 

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,240
situation like that in some sense,
you know,

21
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,160
because you'll be faced with illness in 
the people that you love and in crisis.

22
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:19,161
And so it's a,
it's a practical guide to coping with 

23
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:22,551
those sorts of things.
Like in one of the things you do when 

24
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:23,550
you're overwhelmed by crisis is you 
shortened your timeframe.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You know,
it's like you can't think about next 

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,490
month.
Maybe you can't even bloody well think 

27
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:31,490
about next week or maybe not even 
tomorrow.

28
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,720
You know,
because now is just so overwhelming that

29
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:34,610
that's all there is.

30
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,060
It's like,
and that's what you do.

31
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:39,060
You cut your timeframe back until you 
can cope with it.

32
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:42,210
And if it's not the next week that you 
see how to get through,

33
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:44,580
then it's the next day.
And if it's not the next day,

34
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:47,550
then it's the next hour.
And if it's not the next hour,

35
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,580
then it's the next minute.
And you know,

36
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:52,080
people are very,
very,

37
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,060
very,
very tough.

38
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,610
And it turns out that if you face 
things,

39
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,310
it turns out that if you face things 
that you can put up with a lot more than

40
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:07,311
you think you can put up within,
you can do it without becoming 

41
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:07,980
corrupted.
And she did recover quite,

42
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,350
quite fully and much as a consequence of
our own machinations because she figured

43
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:16,320
out what was wrong with her and then 
took the necessary steps to fix it,

44
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,530
which is nothing short of a bloody 
miracle as far as I'm concerned.

45
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,450
And anyways,
part of the,

46
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,790
the,
the cat bit is I actually started by 

47
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,770
talking about our daughter who actually 
died at about a year ago,

48
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:30,180
but he's still alive in the book.

49
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,960
Um,
I,

50
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,970
you know,
I let people know because dog lovers 

51
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,381
love dogs and if you love cats than they
think you don't like dogs and then they 

52
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:42,830
don't like you.
So I also pointed out at the beginning 

53
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:42,830
of the chapter that,
you know,

54
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,130
if you want a pet,
a dog on the street,

55
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:49,131
that's okay too.
So you don't have to get up in arms 

56
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:49,131
about it.
But.

57
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:49,131
But the idea is that,
you know,

58
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,510
you have to be alert when you're 
suffering,

59
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:54,270
you have to be alert to the beauty in 
life,

60
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,570
the unexpected beauty in life.
And that's kind of what I was trying to 

61
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,781
get across with the idea of the cat.
There's this cat that lives across the 

62
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:02,880
street from us called Ginger Ginger's,
Assamese.

63
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,220
Captain Cat's really aren't domesticated
a technically speaking.

64
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,890
They're still wild animals,
but they kind of like people.

65
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,170
God only knows why,
but they do,

66
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,460
you know.

67
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,860
And so ginger will come wandering over 
and our dog looks at her,

68
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,330
but their friends and she rolls over on 
his back and seek.

69
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,340
We used to noser a bit and then she'd 
kind of Mosey over and let you pet her 

70
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,000
if she was feeling like that day.
And you know,

71
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:28,360
you have to look for those little bit of
stuff,

72
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,900
little bit of sparkling crystal in the 
darkness.

73
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:36,901
When things are bad,
you have to look and see where things 

74
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:38,630
are still beautiful and where there's 
still something that's sustaining.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No,
you narrow your timeframe and you be 

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,561
grateful for what you have.
And that can get you through some very 

77
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,120
dark times and maybe even successfully 
if you're lucky,

78
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:54,121
but even if unsuccessfully,
that maybe it's only tragic and not 

79
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:56,410
absolute hell,
and you can do that,

80
00:03:56,411 --> 00:04:01,411
you know,
in the worst situation you can make it 

81
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:01,411
only tragic and not held.

82
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,910
And there's a big gap between tragedy 
and hell,

83
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,850
you know,
there's nothing worse at a deathbed than

84
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:10,870
to see the people they're fighting.
The death is bad enough,

85
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,080
but you can take that as terrible as it 
is and making into something that's 

86
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,650
absolutely unbearable.
And maybe I think,

87
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:19,290
and this is sort of what I closed the 
book with,

88
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,080
is this idea,
is that if we didn't all attempt to make

89
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,330
terrible things even worse than they 
are,

90
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,690
then maybe we could tolerate the 
terrible things that we have to put up 

91
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,230
with in order to exist.
And maybe we could make the world into a

92
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,280
better place,
you know?

93
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:38,281
And it's what we should be doing and 
what we could be doing because we don't 

94
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:39,520
have anything better to do.
And that's what the book is about.

95
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:44,380
And that's the end of 12 rules for life.

96
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,150
Thanks.
