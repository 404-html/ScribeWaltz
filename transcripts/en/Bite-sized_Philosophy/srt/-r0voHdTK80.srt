1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
My,
my main question is actually something 

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,081
you said a couple of lectures ago.
It was something along the lines of a 

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,220
family.
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,100
I'm like,
God,

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,890
that's the history of your family.
Kind of like the sins of your family,

6
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:16,650
something like that.
Yeah.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,590
Do you,
uh,

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,630
you're facing it all the time?
Yup.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,670
What's a.
can you expand on that more?

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,280
Well,
there's this idea in the old testament 

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,231
that your sins might be visited onto 
your family seven generations down.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,680
Seems kind of harsh,
but you know,

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,100
when you're confronting maybe your 
father's tyrannical.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:42,990
Yeah.
But you know,

15
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:46,510
maybe his father beat the hell out of 
him and maybe his father,

16
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:51,511
his father was a vicious alcoholic and 
he just bloody well don't know how far 

17
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:52,530
back that goes.
And,

18
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:56,070
and that means also you don't exactly 
know what you're dealing with,

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,700
right?
To some degree you're dealing with your 

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:01,700
father,
but only partly what you're dealing with

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,020
is the pathological paternal spirit,
something like that.

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,230
And it's better to think about that way 
because it becomes an existential issue 

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,230
at that point.
You know?

24
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,780
So you could say that while the father 
has two components,

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,850
and I,
I mean this psychologically speaking,

26
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:17,550
there's the great father that's 
beneficial in protective,

27
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,730
that organize the society and teaches 
you how to speak and has produced all 

28
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,441
these wonderful things,
and then there's the tyrannical 

29
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:29,930
oppressive part of the father,
just like there's the terrible part of 

30
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,401
mother nature that's destructive and the
benevolent part of Mother Nature that's 

31
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:36,120
wonderful and productive and you're 
stuck with that,

32
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:36,660
right?

33
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,710
You're stuck with having to mediate 
between those opposing forces,

34
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:45,711
just like you're stuck with the 
adversarial part of yourself in the 

35
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:46,710
heroic part of yourself and it's up to 
you to set those things.

36
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:50,130
Right.
Otherwise they propagate into the future

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,880
and it isn't.
It's a straightforward thing to say how 

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:55,880
to set them.
Right.

39
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,120
There's quite a good movie about that.
Oh No,

40
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:02,660
I won't be Magnolia,
which I really love.

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,940
It's by Paul Anderson,
if I remember correctly.

42
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,030
I hope that's right.
It's a beautiful movie and it's about 

43
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,820
this.
Part of it's about this kid whose father

44
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,280
is really pushing them to be a superstar
at a,

45
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,840
at a quistio.
Right?

46
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:15,950
He's a genius kid.
Hey,

47
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,480
and uh,

48
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,290
the kids studies,
this guy named Charles Sport,

49
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,320
you don't understand this movie if you 
don't know this because you got to know 

50
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,320
about Charles fort to understand 
magnolia.

51
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,770
Charles for was this weird old guy who 
got rich with an inheritance when he was

52
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,950
20 and spent the rest of his life in 
libraries looking up impossible things 

53
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,911
and documenting them.
Impossible things that couldn't happen 

54
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:43,451
from a scientific perspective that we're
well attested to by multiple observers 

55
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:45,740
and he produced this news paper called 
the 14 times,

56
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:50,741
which still runs anyways in Magnolia.
Magnolia begins with this guy who falls 

57
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:56,711
out of a building and then it's shot by 
a woman who misses her husband with a 

58
00:02:56,711 --> 00:03:00,701
rifle as he falls and I think she's a.
she's charged murder and the street 

59
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:03,240
names have something to do with the 
death sentence fault.

60
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:08,241
And all of that happened,
and then in the movie there's a rain of 

61
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:10,330
frogs and there are rains of frogs from 
time to time.

62
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,820
Sometimes they're frozen,
sometimes their reins of fish.

63
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:14,110
Sometimes they're frozen.
It's like,

64
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,700
what the hell?
How does that happen?

65
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,630
Happens quite frequently as it turns out
there's a rain of frogs in the,

66
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,980
in the,
uh,

67
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,040
movie magnolia and this little kid see 
what happened to him is that he's on 

68
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,511
stage and he ends up peeing his pants 
because of the pressure basically and 

69
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:37,441
humiliates himself and then there's this
reign of frogs which she kind of takes 

70
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:42,021
us a sign from God and then he goes to 
his father even he's like eight years 

71
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:42,220
old,
this kid and he says,

72
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,270
you have to stop doing this to me.
And He's dead serious about very careful

73
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:48,920
not being,
you know,

74
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,500
what would you call insubordinate?
Nothing like that.

75
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,320
He decides that that's coming to an end 
right now.

76
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,370
And you have to make those decisions in 
your family because otherwise things 

77
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:00,830
propagate down the generations.
Right?

78
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:04,280
And every family is rife with 
pathologies of one form or another.

79
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,200
And you can learn from that and refused 
to push it forward.

80
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,810
And that's part of,
I think what you do when you,

81
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,650
when you,

82
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,770
when you

83
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,630
shoulder your existential burden,
because everyone is the beneficiary and 

84
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,550
the victim of the tyrannical father,
just like everyone is the beneficiary.

85
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:26,010
And the victim of mother nature and of 
themselves,

86
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,790
and so you lock horns without and 
straightened it out one way or another 

87
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,090
and you don't move it forward to the 
next generation.

88
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,930
So.
And maybe you detach it a bit from your 

89
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,961
parents too because God only knows what 
combination of catastrophes culminated 

90
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:47,830
in their particular forms of pathology.
So

91
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,640
good enough.
