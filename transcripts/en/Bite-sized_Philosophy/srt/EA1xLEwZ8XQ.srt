1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,260
In terms of my question,
I think most of your belief that it's 

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,971
extremely important and everything that 
we're doing to speak our mind to speak 

3
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:10,020
really that's why we're here,
but in terms of practicality,

4
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:15,021
there's a lot of things that get in the 
way of our license students and we have 

5
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:16,500
our gala with a perspective.
So,

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,510
um,
in terms of practicality,

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,570
what are kind of maybe your tips and 
your perspective on the steps that 

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,601
students can take to kind of speak their
mind while not sacrificing kind of 

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,030
future prospects?
Well,

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,170
I can tell you a couple of things that 
are very practical.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,950
Don't break in your essays what you 
think the professor wants to hear.

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,840
There's absolutely no excuse whatsoever 
for doing that.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,310
Now.
First of all,

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,370
most professors,
even those who have descended into an 

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,920
estate of ideological possession,
let's say most of them still have enough

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,190
character to grade an essay that's well 
written properly.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,990
So you're actually taking less of a risk
than you would think by stating what you

18
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:01,880
have to take.
But look,

19
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,610
if you start practicing when you're in 
university,

20
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:08,750
when mistakes are rather low,
pandering to the audience,

21
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:12,410
let's say and say what you think will 
get you by,

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,570
you're going to train yourself to do 
that,

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,750
and once that means is you're going to 
train yourself in the false suffocation 

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,080
of your character and your character is 
the only thing you have to guide you 

25
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,800
through life.
No people dream of riches and they dream

26
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:29,801
of luxury and all of that.
But that's a thin defense against the 

27
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:31,460
harsh realities of the world.
You have your character,

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,640
and so what you do when you go to 
university is you learn to say what you 

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,971
think is clearly as you can and to take 
the slings and arrows that come along 

30
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:39,971
with that.

31
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:40,730
Not In an arrogant manner,
right?

32
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,320
Because like,
what the hell do you know?

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,390
You know,
so you've got plenty to learn,

34
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:46,160
but you want to formulate your thoughts 
carefully.

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,350
You want to write what you think.
Well,

36
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:50,450
why?
Because when you're writing,

37
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,590
you're thinking,
you're laying out the arguments that 

38
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,461
you're going to use to structure your 
existence in the world throughout your 

39
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:01,610
entire life,
and if you start to twist and bend those

40
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,840
for expedient reasons,
you're going to warp your soul,

41
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,620
and I mean I could talk about that 
neurophysiologically if you want to.

42
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,710
You know,
you become what you practice.

43
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,010
You automate what you practice,
so if you automate expedient speech for 

44
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:22,411
the sake of short term gain,
then that's what you're going to 

45
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:22,411
produce.
You're going to produce expedient speech

46
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:23,380
for short term gain.
Well,

47
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:28,381
God help you if you do that,
like there is nothing that you will 

48
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:32,761
possibly do in your entire life that 
will serve you better than to get 

49
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:38,320
control of your voice in university I've
ever see you do that by reading,

50
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:38,830
right?

51
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,940
You read great people.
You do that by writing what you think.

52
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:47,941
You stay true to yourself while you 
write what you think and you take the 

53
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:48,370
risks and you gain the benefits that go 
along with that.

54
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,580
You learn to stand up and speak and to 
listen carefully and that makes you a 

55
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,231
negotiator of unparalleled power,
and if you're a negotiator of 

56
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:02,281
unparalleled power,
there's nothing the world that won't 

57
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:05,041
open itself up to you,
so that's what you're doing in 

58
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:08,221
university and if you find professors 
who who reject that and there's fewer of

59
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:14,011
them than you might think,
then it's your sacred obligation to 

60
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:19,111
stand up for yourself against that 
because it's going to happen to you 

61
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:22,831
throughout your whole life and you might
as well start practicing how to do it 

62
00:03:22,831 --> 00:03:24,790
right now.
So that's how it looks to me.

63
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,250
Yeah,
there's an old saying that I,

64
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,220
I right.

65
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,470
Thank you.

66
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,690
I write in order to know what I think 
and you'll note how compelled speech 

67
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,520
interferes in that process.
Yes.

68
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,820
So the idea that you have to write what 
your professor wants is a form of 

69
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,130
compelled speech.
It's like,

70
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,250
I really do believe that this is a 
fundamental issue.

71
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,440
As a therapist say when I'm trying to 
help someone set their life straight,

72
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,640
I do my best not to compel their speech.
And the reason for that is quite clear.

73
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:06,580
It's like you have your destiny with all
its attended,

74
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,380
triumphs and sufferings and it's on your
shoulders.

75
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,770
I don't want to tell you how to think.
I don't want to tell you how to think 

76
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,710
because I do not know how you should 
think.

77
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,980
You have to figure that out for yourself
and then you have to bear the 

78
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,491
responsibility for that and you are a 
terribly arrogant fool if you dare to 

79
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:31,230
tell someone else how it is that they 
should conduct themselves through life.

80
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,510
Now,
having said that,

81
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:34,890
while obviously I say,
well,

82
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:37,110
you should tell the truth,
or at least you shouldn't lie,

83
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,900
but that's not a dictate of,
of,

84
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,550
of,
of,

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,050
of action,
so to speak.

86
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:45,330
It's a dictative process.
It's like,

87
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,960
well,
you can't.

88
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:50,961
You shouldn't interfere with the 
mechanism that allows you to solve all 

89
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:54,000
the problems that you will face in your 
life and you come to university maybe to

90
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,280
prepare for a trip for a,
for a profession,

91
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,680
no,
and to set yourself up economically,

92
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:01,560
but to set yourself economic 
economically,

93
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:06,561
properly.
I don't care what your profession is 

94
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:08,781
going to be.
There is no one who is more powerful 

95
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:10,290
than someone who can communicate.
It doesn't matter what the field.

96
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,750
It doesn't matter if you're a plumber or
a politician.

97
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,300
If you can formulate your thoughts 
clearly.

98
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,650
If you can conduct yourself honorably in
your action and your speech,

99
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,800
if you're articulate and careful,
then the world opens itself up to you.

100
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:27,390
You have an unlimited horizon of 
possibility,

101
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,130
so thank you very much.

102
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,120
Thank you.
