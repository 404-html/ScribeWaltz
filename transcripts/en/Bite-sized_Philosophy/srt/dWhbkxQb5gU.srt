1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,300
In some ways it's the women that are 
embracing the masculine archetype in 

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,180
some ways that are being successful.
I mean they're.

3
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:08,180
They're being extraordinarily 
responsible and they're.

4
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:10,650
They're feeling a lot of these positions
quicker than men can.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,040
I mean they're and they're graduating at
higher rates of college and they're 

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,011
declining.
They're declining motherhood or they're 

7
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:19,011
at least suspending it throughout the 
west,

8
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:19,800
which is you could argue for either 
ways.

9
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:22,710
There's reasons for that,
but I guess my question is,

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,740
well,
I think that the expression of the 

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:27,740
masculine spirit in women isn't 
denigrated,

12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,530
like women don't get accused of 
contributing to the patriarchy even when

13
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:36,531
they take positions in society that you 
would think are fully patriarchal now 

14
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:41,601
and which is a strange thing.
So women who go to law school and then 

15
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:42,660
and then practice as corporate lawyers 
say,

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,200
aren't subject to the same.
What would you call it?

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,780
Claim that their activity is 
facilitating that.

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,330
The decline of the planet.
I guess because they're seen as well,

19
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:59,331
they're there because of their gender.
I suppose they're seen as as as leaders 

20
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,710
of the rebellion against the patriarchal
spirit.

21
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:03,990
Even though structurally it boils down 
to the same thing,

22
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,210
sure,
so that masculine,

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,720
classically masculine,
symbolically masculine,

24
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,170
yearning for hierarchical productivity 
and competition is rewarded in women but

25
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:21,021
not in men and which is also a very 
perverse thing because it doesn't make 

26
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:25,251
any sense.
It makes sense through the 

27
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,441
postmodernists view,
which is they're just undoing the 

28
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:27,441
oppressor ship of the man and the last 
one,

29
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:29,880
hundred 50 years.
So the ends justify the means.

30
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:34,881
That's the way they look at it.
Whatever power women can take from men 

31
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:36,330
is a good thing.
That's the way they look at it.

32
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,250
Well,
there's a funny thing about that too,

33
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:42,000
that like I,
I read this in 12 rules for life.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I was looking at some of the Pew 
Research Data and I don't remember the 

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,640
figures precisely,
but over the last 15 years,

36
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,090
the percentage of women who young women 
who claim that they would like to be 

37
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,880
married in a permanent relationship has 
gone up a substantial amount.

38
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,180
I don't remember what it was,
a 50 percent approximately springs to 

39
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,740
mind,
but a lot at the same time.

40
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,360
It's declined almost the same degree 
among young men and so what's.

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,600
What's perverse about this,
this is something I've talked to my 

42
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,421
daughter a fair a bit about is that I 
mean if you ask young women what they 

43
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:22,131
want,
I don't know if they can answer because 

44
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:22,950
I don't know if they know if they're 19 
or 20 because I think their heads are so

45
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:25,260
muddled by what they've been told that 
they don't really know,

46
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,570
but my sense is that women want the 
opportunity to develop their career in 

47
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,210
whatever direction they see fit and fair
enough,

48
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,540
but they want an intimate relationship 
and usually a monogamous one that's 

49
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,891
permanent and they want to have the 
opportunity to have kids and what you 

50
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:42,891
see happening.

51
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:44,880
Inevitably,
and I believe this to be the case.

52
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:49,881
I've watched very carefully as I've,
as I've grown up and got older because 

53
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:54,330
I've worked with women my whole life,
is that women are less,

54
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,790
are less compelled by their career as 
they approach their thirties and more 

55
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,531
compelled by the desire to have a 
permanent relationship and biological 

56
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:03,850
too.
I would argue to.

57
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,780
No,
I mean,

58
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,820
I,
I,

59
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,150
I think it's,
it's a biological necessity because 

60
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,220
women have to have children relatively 
young.

61
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,310
That's correct.
But it's interesting to watch it 

62
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,560
phenomenologically and even the women 
that I've seen who've had very high 

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,680
powered careers is that as they move 
into their,

64
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:24,550
especially their early thirties,
they start to realize that the career is

65
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:27,550
a pretty one dimensional enterprise,
even if it's a good career,

66
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,020
because even good careers are still jobs
and good careers.

67
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:33,430
They're also very hard jobs.

68
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,050
They're like 70 hour a week jobs and 
they're full bore commitment jobs and to

69
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,430
figure out how to have a career like 
that and to have a life,

70
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,370
to have a family,
to have an intimate relationship,

71
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,800
to have children and then to also be 
able to take care of them.

72
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,210
That's a very complex,
um,

73
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,610
that's a very complex job to manage.
And so what's strange is,

74
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,790
I think what's strange is that the very 
things that the radicals are undermining

75
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,270
the monogamous family are actually those
things that women most want,

76
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,460
especially as they approach their 
thirties.

77
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,060
And so this is a catastrophe on both 
ends of the,

78
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,900
of the gender distribution.
