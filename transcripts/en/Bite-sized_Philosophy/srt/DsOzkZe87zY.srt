1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,260
Chimps,
I don't know if you know this or not,

2
00:00:02,261 --> 00:00:04,950
but chimps basically go to war.
Uh,

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,500
Jane Goodall discovered that a couple of
decades ago and it really,

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,400
really was hard on her because she was 
kind of a ruse soliah.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,890
So for those of you don't know John,
John Jacques Rousseau is a French 

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,390
philosopher and you know,
French philosophers have a lawful lot of

7
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:21,240
sins on their conscience and of course 
we.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,030
So it was certainly one of them because 
Russell was the first,

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,450
like what fully articulate promoter of 
the idea that human beings were 

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,740
basically good.
So we know we had a good soul in a moral

11
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:37,741
sense,
but we were corrupted by our social 

12
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:37,741
institutions,
you know,

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,560
so,
um,

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,410
so,
you know,

15
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:44,710
as far as Russo was concerned,
it was kind of a noble savage idea,

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,711
you know,
like the human being in their raw form 

17
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:49,711
has a pure soul and then you know,
you,

18
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:51,550
you give them to parents and you'd give 
them to teachers and you know,

19
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:56,551
they'd get into politics and there's 
group disputes and then they get all 

20
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:56,551
corrupted,
you know,

21
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:58,210
and well,
you know,

22
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:00,010
that's,
I don't know even what to say about that

23
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:02,020
except that it's absolutely moronic 
keynote,

24
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,290
but it's,
it's an appealing proposition if you're 

25
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:07,290
naive optimist.
I mean,

26
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,561
first of all,
it doesn't explain where malevolence 

27
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:10,930
comes from because the people created 
the institution.

28
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:11,650
So,
you know,

29
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:16,651
it just puts you into an infinite 
regress chicken and egg if the 

30
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:20,371
institutions are reprehensible,
but the people who built them aren't 

31
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,731
then where did the reprehensible 
elements that the institutions come 

32
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:23,731
from?

33
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:27,090
You know,
he might think it's an audio generating 

34
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,090
consequences of organizing people.
But you know,

35
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,471
it's a pretty specious theory.
So I'm of course he had a counterpart of

36
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:36,601
philosophical counterpart,
Thomas Hobbs and Hobbs said basically 

37
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:36,601
exactly the opposite,
that you know,

38
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,670
people were vicious and cruel unless you
like put them in straight jackets 

39
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,201
fundamentally and made them obey.
Then everything was going to go 

40
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:46,810
immediately to help you know,
when,

41
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,780
when,
when you saw what happened in Iran after

42
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:52,680
the Americans walled stand in,
the power structure disintegrated.

43
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,500
Do you know what was a hell of a lot 
more like than it was like Russell,

44
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,530
right?
You took out the tyrant at the top and 

45
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,480
it wasn't like everybody got all 
peaceful and loving.

46
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:03,910
All of a sudden it was like absolute 
chaos reigned.

47
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,000
So you know,
of course you can rationalize that.

48
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,250
But anyways,
roost.

49
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:13,251
So by the way,
had five children by illiterate made 

50
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:18,030
that that was as Mr.
and you put every single one of them in 

51
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,140
orphanages where of course they perished
because orphanages have Russo's times.

52
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,830
We're not exactly,
you know,

53
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,970
a luxury resort.
And even up until the beginning of the 

54
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,610
20th century,
most children who are under one years of

55
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:32,230
age who were in care institutions died 
partly disease.

56
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:37,231
And that sort of thing,
but often because they just weren't 

57
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:37,231
touched,
they weren't cared for physically.

58
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:40,180
Even if they were fed and you know,
200 years ago they weren't even fed

59
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:43,700
anyway,
so,

60
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:44,780
you know,
but nonetheless,

61
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:45,890
you know,
people have people

62
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,300
maintain the optimistic idea that human 
beings were basically good and that they

63
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:55,210
were corrupted by institutions.
It's a common idea among.

64
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,460
I think it's a very common idea in 
universities,

65
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,530
you know,
because university people are always 

66
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,250
complaining about the corrupt nature of 
this institution and that institution,

67
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,820
you know,
while they sit here in the warm with the

68
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,010
electricity on,
you know,

69
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,250
it's surrounded by wealth that 
characterizes maybe one 10th of one 

70
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:14,710
percent of the entire world's 
population.

71
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:19,711
And you know,
they complained about how we'll press 

72
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:19,711
they are and how will we know nasty the 
institutions are.

73
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:19,930
It's like,
yeah,

74
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:22,570
well you actually haven't been to a 
nasty institution,

75
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,550
you know,
cause nasty institutions.

76
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:29,551
They get pretty damn bad.
And most of the institutions in the 

77
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:32,641
world are like that.
So it isn't exactly clear that people 

78
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:34,660
are pristine in their heart and then 
corrupted by institutions.

79
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,300
Although I'm sure that happens patent 
depends around,

80
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,460
for example.
So anyways,

81
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,390
this has been a line of philosophical 
speculation.

82
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:44,350
That's,
that's,

83
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,380
that's I would say constituted one of 
the unspoken fundamental assumptions of,

84
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,650
of Western intellectuals in particular.
And Jane Goodall thought,

85
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,850
you know,
in many ways the same way she thought 

86
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:58,850
chimps were basically,
you know,

87
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,170
they're just animals.
They are okay.

88
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:04,171
They exist,
coexist relatively peacefully with one 

89
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:04,171
another,
you know,

90
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:04,790
even,
um,

91
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,010
Carl Rogers,
who I talk about a bit in my personality

92
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:12,480
class,
you know,

93
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,610
he basically thought that people are 
fundamentally good and that institutions

94
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:17,220
make them bad.
But,

95
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:22,221
uh,
the problem is you look at chimps and 

96
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:22,221
narrow a fair bit like us,
you know,

97
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,020
Bonobos,
you can look at them too,

98
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:28,021
and they're,
they're genetically quite related to us 

99
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:28,021
and they're quite a bit different than 
chimps,

100
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:31,921
but.
So we're sort of a weird mixture of the 

101
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:31,921
two in some sense.

102
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:31,921
But Champs,
like those things,

103
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,380
there is no evidence that they really 
have any internal control over their 

104
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,020
regression at all.
You know,

105
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,080
there was a horrible case about two 
years ago where a woman was interacting 

106
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,950
with the chimp and it tore her to pieces
and they can do that.

107
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,900
Man took her face right off and they 
have the strength of about six men,

108
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,730
like an,
an,

109
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:51,490
uh,
an adult.

110
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,430
Male chimp can break a 300 pound test 
cable,

111
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,110
you know,
those things are really,

112
00:04:56,111 --> 00:05:00,010
really strong and they are not friendly,
you know,

113
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:03,970
like.
So in Arnhem Zoo for example,

114
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,470
there's been a troop of chimps there 
that have been followed by an extremely 

115
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:14,791
brilliant apartment hall and just named 
Frans de Waal who's work I would very 

116
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:18,211
highly recommend.
The Wall is a very smart guy and he's 

117
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:18,220
looked at the origins of morality and 
chimpanzees,

118
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,230
you know,
from a biological perspective,

119
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:21,520
it's very,
very nice work.

120
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,600
Very,
very clearheaded.

121
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,990
But you know,
he's recounted absolutely horrific 

122
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,920
stories of chimpanzee behavior.
So one of the stories he talked about,

123
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:30,820
for example,
was,

124
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,330
you know,
when you kind of have this idea that 

125
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:36,330
there's a mail chimp hierarchy,
it's roughly true.

126
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,411
There's a female hierarchy too,
but the males and the chimp world 

127
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:40,450
anyways tend to be the dominant ones and
you know,

128
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:43,390
you kind of think of a dominant primate 
like a prize fighter,

129
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:48,391
you know,
pretty much he's ruling because of his 

130
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:51,391
physical prowess.
Now that turns out not to exactly be 

131
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:52,240
true,
but in this particular case,

132
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:57,241
the guy who was running the chimp troop 
was a bit of a bully and he wasn't very 

133
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:57,241
good at making friends.
You know,

134
00:05:57,241 --> 00:06:02,081
and that's not such a good idea because 
no matter how tough you are by yourself 

135
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:02,480
to weaker guys can probably take you 
out.

136
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,480
And that's what happened during friends 
to was observations and two chimps 

137
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,050
attack the leader and they had a 
coalition.

138
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:10,690
They were grooming each other.
They repels,

139
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,680
you know,
in chimps are pretty good at remembering

140
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,640
like risk reciprocal relationships and 
having friendships really.

141
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:18,350
Like they have a very highly social 
structure.

142
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,700
Hey,
just tore him apart.

143
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:22,400
Like the things they did to him like you
don't even want to talk about.

144
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,730
And so chimps have really no upper limit
on their capacity for aggression and 

145
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,310
when they hunt.
Because chimps,

146
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:33,311
Honda and they liked me,
they often call us monkeys and they 

147
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:33,600
weigh about 35 pounds,
like a cola.

148
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,890
This monkeys a major league animal,
and they eat those things alive and they

149
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:41,891
scream while they're being killed and 
that does not slow the chimps down one 

150
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:44,891
bit.
So it's not obvious that the chimp is 

151
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:45,740
really a creature of a lot of empathy,
especially the males.

152
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,950
The females are likely more empathic 
because they have to deal with infants 

153
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,071
for longer periods of time.
What seems to inhibit the aggression of 

154
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:56,360
mail chimp's isn't anything they hold 
internally.

155
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:59,090
It seems that when they get hyper 
aggressive in the truth,

156
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,030
the truth gets more and more agitated 
and basically shuts them down.

157
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,590
So you can imagine maybe you're in a 
rough bar and some Dingbat who was,

158
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:10,591
you know,
half psychopathic and has had two pints 

159
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,391
of alcohol is starting to cause a 
tremendous amount of trouble and he's 

160
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,780
not going to shut himself down,
but the rest of the truth might.

161
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,980
And that kind of means that the control 
over the aggression is externalized.

162
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,500
It's not a consequence of super ego 
control.

163
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:24,920
And we like to think that we actually 
control our own aggression,

164
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,590
but I'm not so sure about that.
You know,

165
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:30,230
if you read things like there's a great 
book,

166
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,310
Horrifying Book published about 20 years
ago called the rape of Nanking,

167
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:37,160
which is while the woman who wrote it 
committed suicide.

168
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,550
So that sort of suffices to tell you 
what the rape of Nanking is about.

169
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:45,551
And it's a story about the Japanese in 
World War II going into a Chinese kid 

170
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:48,410
city called Nan King where I believe 
about 350,000

171
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:53,411
people were killed.
And the Nazis in that story where the 

172
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:53,780
good guys.
So you can imagine the kind of brutality

173
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:58,781
that might be occurring there.
But there's absolutely perfectly well 

174
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:02,831
documented evidence suggesting that the 
Japanese soldiers engaged in competitive

175
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:04,540
brutality.
You know.

176
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,580
And so really what happened was the 
Japanese had been pretty militarized by 

177
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,481
World War Two and native adopted a 
Prussian education system and the 

178
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:14,150
Russians and Germans,
you know,

179
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,250
pre,
Pre 20th century Germans,

180
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,500
they were basically interested in 
educating obedient soldiers,

181
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,710
you know,
because it was a militaristic culture 

182
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,451
and the Japanese kind of adopted that 
because they were sick of being kicked 

183
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:31,211
around by the Europeans and pretty 
successfully because they defeated the 

184
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:31,211
Russians,
you know,

185
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,120
in the early stages of Roe or of the 
20th century.

186
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,970
It was quite a shock to everyone in 
Europe and,

187
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,610
you know,
cause for great celebration in Japan and

188
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:38,690
no wonder.
But anyways,

189
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:42,110
they militarize the hell out of their 
young men and taught them basically that

190
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:44,270
the Japanese were a master race,
you know,

191
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:49,271
and that other people were sub humans.
It's a very common human way of 

192
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:49,271
thinking,
by the way.

193
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:54,010
I would say it's really the default way 
that human tribes think about other 

194
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,180
tribes.
You what?

195
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:57,090
I mean,
it's a little more complicated than that

196
00:08:57,091 --> 00:09:00,570
because human tribes tend to trade with 
other tribes.

197
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,660
So it's not all demonization,
but a lot of it is,

198
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,690
you know,
and if you look around the world in the 

199
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,750
anthropological literature,
what you see is that the names that most

200
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:12,330
tribes have for themselves is something 
like that,

201
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:17,331
human beings or the people you know,
indicating that the rest of the people 

202
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:18,030
are reading people,
God only leader,

203
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:23,031
barbarians or you know,
they live out where the sun is being 

204
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:23,520
eaten by the dragon of the night or 
something like that.

205
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,800
And you know,
the word barbarian is a,

206
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,910
is a word that comes from the Greeks 
making fun of how non-greek spoke.

207
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,920
Know they thought they were bar bar,
Bar,

208
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:32,610
Bar,
Bar,

209
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,790
something like that.
So anyways,

210
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,400
what goodall phone was the chimps,
the chimp,

211
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:43,401
adolescence in particular in particular,
the males would patrol the borders of 

212
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:45,360
their territory,
uh,

213
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,750
in groups of three or four and with 
often with a female or two.

214
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:50,790
But the females didn't seem to be really
the,

215
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,110
the,
the,

216
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:57,650
they weren't,
they were more part of the group rather 

217
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,261
than the initiators.
But what the chimps would do is if they 

218
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:03,021
found a chimp from another troop,
even if that was a chimp that had moved 

219
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:05,520
from their troop in the not too distant 
past and joined another,

220
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,190
because sometimes the males leave and 
sometimes they go to other troops.

221
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,430
If they are numbered them,
they would tear them to pieces and it 

222
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,210
looked like that's why they were doing 
the border patrol.

223
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,540
They're out looking for trouble there.
Gangs roughly speaking,

224
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,820
they're looking for trouble.
But the point of it is is that,

225
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,570
and they would only attack if they have 
numbers because chimps can.

226
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,990
I wouldn't say they count,
but they have a rudimentary notion of 

227
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,020
group size.
You know,

228
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,840
I don't think you can count without 
being able to verbalize,

229
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,480
but you can estimate at a glance.
And so,

230
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,890
you know,
when I mean,

231
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:40,200
when I say tear apart,
that's exactly what I mean.

232
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,260
There's no upper limit on the brutality.
And so good all discovered that first.

233
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,780
And she didn't tell anybody above it.
Now she had a reasons.

234
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,690
I mean some of them I think radiological
or the lovely chimps,

235
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:53,190
you know,
and fair enough.

236
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,170
But some of it was also she thought that
maybe the chimps had been corrupted as a

237
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:03,171
consequence of their contact with human 
beings and that their natural behavior 

238
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:03,630
had been somehow transform,
you know,

239
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:06,570
and that's not,
it's reasonable to be cautious if you're

240
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:08,220
a scientist before you go out and say,
hey,

241
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,620
chimps go to war.
Isn't that revolutionary?

242
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:12,060
Because it is,
right?

243
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,280
Because it just,
it just ends.

244
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:18,180
The idea that our war,
like and malevolent nature is a function

245
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:20,160
of culture.
Like if chimps do it well,

246
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:21,900
what are they perverted by their own 
culture?

247
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,470
I don't think so.
You know,

248
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,850
I mean there are more and less violent 
chimp cultures and there are more and 

249
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,740
less violent baboons culture.
So there was some cultural variation,

250
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,770
but since goodall's time,
this sort of behavior is being 

251
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,290
documented on many,
many chimp truths.

252
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,870
So that's us in a nutshell.
