1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,800
Well,
here's the decomposition of the,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,890
of the fundamental archetype.
The dragon of chaos differentiates on 

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,280
the one hand into the feminine.
That's the unknown,

4
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:16,281
and the feminine differentiates further 
into the negative feminine than the 

5
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:21,050
Positive Feminine.
The negative feminine is the reason for 

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:21,140
which haunts.
It's the reason for,

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,820
um,
you know,

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,930
there's a whole group online called men 
going their own way.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,420
M,
g,

10
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:30,450
T,
O w,

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,570
that's a very interesting group to go 
study.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,110
There's lots of them.
I don't know how many of them there are,

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,760
and most of them are older.
Many of them are men who've been through

14
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:41,430
a particularly horrifying divorce for 
one reason or another,

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,120
and there they've had enough of women so
they stay.

16
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:50,121
Tell that young men that they're 
teaching never have a permanent 

17
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:51,480
relationship.
Never share your territory with a woman,

18
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,630
never share your possessions.
Make sure you never lived together and 

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,651
don't stay with one long enough to enter
a common law relationship because you 

20
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:01,290
will be stripped of everything that you 
have.

21
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,950
Well,
that's a hell of a thing to be telling 

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,571
people,
but what's happened is that the female 

23
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:11,091
has been manifested in their life only 
as the negative archetype and they've 

24
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:13,320
got that confused with all women and 
that's partly,

25
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,620
you know,
you gotta ask yourself if you know the 

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:18,620
mythological stories,
maybe if you made the right sacrifices,

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,860
you wouldn't have so much trouble with 
women.

28
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,460
It's a,
it's a good question to ask yourself 

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:25,460
first,
and I would also say,

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,140
you know,
if you're a woman who has trouble with 

31
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,150
man or you're a man who has trouble with
women,

32
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,210
it's not the women and it's not the man,
it's you because the women are telling 

33
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:40,311
you what's wrong with you and the men 
are telling you what's wrong with you 

34
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:42,960
and if you don't listen then it's you.
It's either you are all men.

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,730
Well that's easy.
It's all men.

36
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:47,190
While that's certainly how it's played 
out in the world right now,

37
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,240
it's like,
no,

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,390
it's not all men.
You can be by definition,

39
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,810
by definition,
and it's not all women.

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,270
That's for sure.
I don't want to have anything to do with

41
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:59,580
women.
It's like you're a pathetic weasel.

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,290
That's the same statement.
