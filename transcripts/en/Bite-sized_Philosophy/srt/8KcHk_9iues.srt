00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,580
Hello Dr Peterson,
I've been trying to listen to my 

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,951
conscience,
but I can't tell the difference between 

3
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:09,230
fear,
willful blindness or genuine conscience.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,470
Well,
the first thing I would say about that 

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,260
is it is quite clear that you are in 
fact trying to listen to your conscience

6
00:00:15,261 --> 00:00:18,140
because that's probably the first thing 
that you discover,

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,020
so that's a really good question.
Okay,

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,450
fear.
Well,

9
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:30,270
here's a test and you don't want to do 
this stupidly.

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,030
If you think that you should do 
something and you think that the reason 

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,080
you might not be doing it is because 
you're afraid,

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,370
then you should do it.

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,540
So that way you can find out if it's 
fear.

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,570
No,
I think your question is,

15
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:53,571
well,
how do I know my conscience isn't just 

16
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:53,571
masquerading as fear saying,
well,

17
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:55,800
you shouldn't do that,
but it's rationalizing the real issue,

18
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:58,260
which is you're afraid of doing that.
Now,

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,530
see,
here's a reason that you want to tell 

20
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:03,530
the truth.
And I parked.

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,690
I kind of figured this out when I was 
looking deeply into the Pinocchio Story.

22
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:10,590
You know when Pinocchio as Pinocchio 
strives to become real,

23
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:12,840
he,
he has a conscience to guide him,

24
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:15,090
but it's jimminy cricket,
this insect,

25
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,670
but Gemini isn't really a very good 
conscience.

26
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:20,910
He's a bit dogmatic to begin with,
dogmatic and didn't experienced,

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,530
and so it's.
It's not like the conscience is an 

28
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,201
unerring guide.
It's like a partner in discovery and as 

29
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:35,331
you move forward in your life and you 
consult your conscience and you listened

30
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:39,780
to it,
then it gets smarter and so to you,

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,500
but there's a Coda there,
and this is why I've suggested part of 

32
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,990
the reason why I've suggested so 
frequently in my lectures and in my book

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,030
that people try not to lie.

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,790
See,
there are many systems.

35
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:58,791
You have many systems within.
Let's say that guide you and one of 

36
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:04,341
those is your capacity for rational 
thought and then you have a variety of 

37
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:07,221
emotional systems and motivational 
systems and internal dramas and 

38
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:11,550
intuitions and bodily sensations like 
lots and lots of incenses.

39
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,850
Lots of systems that are guiding you and
many of them operate.

40
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,400
You might say,
unconsciously,

41
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,850
autonomously,
instinctively,

42
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,380
implicitly,
all of that.

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Now you pr nonetheless,
you programmed them like you feed them 

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,931
content,
let's say just like you feed your body 

45
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:38,721
nourishment,
you feed them content and a lot of the 

46
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:41,661
content that you feed them pertains 
directly to your voluntary thoughts and 

47
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:46,140
speech and your actions and then if you 
pathologize those by lying,

48
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,380
so if you say things that you know not 
to be true or you don't say things that 

49
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,981
you know to be true when you need to,
which is more common and if you act in 

50
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:59,400
ways that you consider that an act in 
ways you considered reprehensible,

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,480
then you pathologize all of those 
autonomous systems that guide you.

52
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,480
It's like you're programming them badly.
You're building an AI system inside 

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,200
yourself really in in,
in some sense that is what you're doing.

54
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,590
That has very bad.
It's very bad training data and so the 

55
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,611
output it produces will be will,
won't guide you properly and so you 

56
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:24,790
don't want to pathologize your guidance 
systems.

57
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,850
It's a really bad idea.
So that's why you have to not lie and 

58
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,390
maybe that's also why you have to say 
what you have to say and you have to say

59
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,380
clearly as well and you have to learn 
how to do that.

60
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,700
So that's one of the ways of getting 
your conscience straightened out.

61
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,120
And then you have to have a dialogue 
with your conscience and you might ask.

62
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:43,690
It's like,
okay,

63
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:48,691
well what should I do or what should,
should I do this or should I not do 

64
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:49,330
this?
So let's say you're thinking,

65
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,320
should I not do this?

66
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,180
In the case of a temptation,
maybe you have a chance to develop a new

67
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,290
relationship.
You know,

68
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,830
and you're,
you're excited about it and apprehensive

69
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:04,810
about it and afraid of it and you don't 
know how to sort out all those feelings.

70
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,290
And the first thing is you really have 
to want to sort them out.

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,520
That's why you have to orient yourself 
to something that's a genuine up.

72
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,410
You know that the star above the 
horizon,

73
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:19,411
you have to really want things to be 
straight and you have to have thought 

74
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:24,121
that through.
And you have to know what it means for 

75
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:27,421
things not to be straight,
and really what it means is that you're 

76
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:29,140
headed for hell in one way or another.
And if you understand that it's enough,

77
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,290
maybe it's enough to scare you straight.
You really gotta think that through.

78
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,620
Then you've got to think about how much 
better it would be if you aimed up and 

79
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,500
and that really has to kind of permeate 
your whole being.

80
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,100
And so then you're oriented that way 
you're oriented to adopt and you're 

81
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,060
deciding that it's okay to try to tell 
the truth and then you can start to rely

82
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:51,061
on this dialogue with your conscience.
But both of you have to learn and you're

83
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:54,340
gonna make mistakes along the way.
You know that's okay.

84
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:55,000
You can say,
well,

85
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,250
I'm going to try this without being 
certain that it's right.

86
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,730
You can even say,
I'm going to say this without being 

87
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,520
certain that it's correct.
Like if you're arguing with your wife or

88
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:06,070
your husband or your or your sister,
your father,

89
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,920
and you have an idea about what might be
going on.

90
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:10,810
You can say,
look,

91
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,890
here's my idea about what's going on,
who knows what that idea might be 

92
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:22,141
contaminated with like,
maybe I'm putting it forward just 

93
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:24,631
because I'm too proud or arrogant or 
angry or fearful or whatever that's 

94
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:25,090
possible.

95
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,150
Let's see if we can figure that out.
But you can offer it tentatively and 

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,010
both have at it.
That's what you do.

97
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:34,240
If it's a hypothesis,
right.

98
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:37,270
You both have at it and see if it's an 
idea that's worthy of,

99
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,270
of keeping you do that with your 
conscience.

100
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,250
And then you were moved forward.
There's a,

101
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,650
there's a technique in behavioral 
psychology called psychotherapy called 

102
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,610
collaborative empiricism.
So let's say that we,

103
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:57,270
you and I have been sitting down and we 
decided that you're going to try 

104
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,641
something new this week,
like maybe your agoraphobic and you're 

105
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:02,861
having a hard time in a parking lot and 
so getting out of the car and going to 

106
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:03,260
the grocery store.
So maybe we say,

107
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,190
well,
you know,

108
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,080
drive to the grocery store and you're 
just gonna walk halfway to the two,

109
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,900
halfway from your car to the door and 
that's good enough for like,

110
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:15,590
do that every second day for a week and 
then come back and let's talk about it.

111
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,950
So that's collaborative empiricism.
You're running little experiments,

112
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,070
you think what your conscience is 
guiding you towards something.

113
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,420
You take a tentative step in that 
direction and then you check and see,

114
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,110
well,
you know,

115
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:31,340
did what I wanted to have happen or 
occur as an outcome.

116
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,760
That's the crucial question and that's 
the crucial question for behavioral 

117
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:36,760
truth,
right?

118
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,691
That's the pragmatic perspective.
Did what I want to have happened happen 

119
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,300
as a consequence of my framework of 
interpretation and my action.

120
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,250
If the answer is yes,
then I have not invalidated it.

121
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,120
Right?
That's,

122
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,610
that's the pragmatic philosophy in a 
nutshell.

123
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,540
And it's,
it's very,

124
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:58,541
very smart.
So you have a dialogue with your 

125
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:05,000
conscience that never ends and hopefully
it gets wiser and you get wiser.

126
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,320
And

127
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,100
that's the dialogue that young talked 
about between the conscious and the 

128
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,100
unconscious,
between your,

129
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,380
your fantasy life.
Say the life that sort of underneath you

130
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:23,550
as a conscious being like the life 
that's part of your biological platform,

131
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:28,551
the biological platform that somehow 
miraculously gives rise to your 

132
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:30,690
consciousness.
If a dialogue with that.

133
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,370
We're always in dialogue.
We're always in dialogue,

134
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,660
right with everything,

135
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,160
so pursue that.
