1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,920
One of the things that I learned while I
was going through this was the meaning 

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,461
of the name Israel because Jacob 
eventually it gets named Israel and I'm 

3
00:00:09,461 --> 00:00:11,570
jumping ahead a little bit tender to the
next lecture,

4
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:16,571
but Israel and so he's also the father 
of Israel and the father of the 12 sons 

5
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:22,031
who make up the 12 tribes of Israel,
but what Israel means is he who 

6
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:25,601
struggles with God and that's such an 
interesting idea because it's again,

7
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:30,611
a psychological idea and that's why I 
said earlier that it isn't obvious in 

8
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:35,021
the old testament what it means to 
believe in God because what Jacob does 

9
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:37,820
struggle with God and I think that 
that's a really good characterization of

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,690
an ethical life because if you're trying
to lead an ethical life,

11
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:44,210
that's what you're doing is you're.
You're struggling.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,200
Like blind belief isn't helpful because 
you don't know what you're believing in.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,910
Like.
It's just not that helpful,

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,420
but if you're possessed by,
by the desire to orient yourself 

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,630
properly,
but also confused by the,

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,880
by the existential structure of the 
world,

17
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:03,881
which we all are.
Then then what you're doing when you're 

18
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:06,701
trying to orient yourself properly in 
life is struggling ethically and in 

19
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:09,050
Jacob actually gets quite hurt.
He wrestles with God,

20
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:12,020
literally God dislocates his,
his,

21
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,290
his thigh.
And so the idea there is watch the hell 

22
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:17,290
out,
right?

23
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,760
The thing that you're contending with,
his powerful,

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,790
although you can contend with it,
that's the thing that's so interesting,

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,310
but you know,
you do it at some genuine peril,

26
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:28,640
which I think is exactly right,
but the idea that Israel,

27
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,770
so there's Israel,
the state,

28
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:32,870
let's say in Israel,
the promised land and all of that,

29
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:35,030
but there's this more important idea 
which is again,

30
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,060
a psychological idea which is the state 
of Israel,

31
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:43,061
which is the promised land is the state 
that everyone who wrestles with God 

32
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:48,010
exists in and that's not happy,
naive belief in,

33
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,320
you know,
uh,

34
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,450
an eternally blessed afterlife.

35
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,670
It's not that it's not a wish 
fulfillment,

36
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:56,670
it's,
it's,

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,430
it's to be actively engaged in life,
in the difficulties of life.

38
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,460
Right?
And trying to find the path because 

39
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,030
that's what wrestling with God is trying
to find the path.

40
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:13,210
And that seems to me what belief means 
fundamentally in the Old Testament and 

41
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,951
perhaps in the new testament as well as 
that belief is expressed in trying to 

42
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:22,781
find the path.
And that's an ethical struggle and it's 

43
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:23,060
a real struggle.
It's the struggle of life.

44
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:25,880
So as long as you're willing to engage 
in that struggle,

45
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,750
then hypothetically you have the divine 
behind you.

46
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,620
And so I believe that.
I think that's true because the other 

47
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:41,771
thing I see is that the people who set 
things right so that the,

48
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,980
the,
the horrible forces of cosmic 

49
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,221
destruction don't do us in the people 
who are trying to set things right are 

50
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:55,271
the ones that are struggling ethically 
and so and that there is a redemptive 

51
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:59,891
element to that.
And I don't think there's any way of 

52
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,320
being cynical about that.
So.

53
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,020
Well,
so thank you.

54
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:03,350
Will.

55
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,920
Thank you.
