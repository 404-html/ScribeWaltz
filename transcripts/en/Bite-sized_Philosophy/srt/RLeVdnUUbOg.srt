1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,020
Traditional Chinese doctors go into 
people's houses to diagnose why it is 

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,311
that someone in that house of suffering 
and they walk in and they think there's 

3
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:12,090
too much order here.
I've been in houses like that.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,720
That's a house where all the furniture 
is covered with plastic.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,320
That's a house where if you put a glass 
on a wooden table,

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,750
that mistress of the house runs over 
with the coaster,

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,480
slips it under immediately and gives you
a dirty look.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,510
That's a place where the children never 
play in the living room.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,080
That's a place where the lines in the 
carpet or vacuum so precisely that 

10
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:38,451
they're actually parallel.
That's a place where there's so much 

11
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:42,921
order that no one can survive because 
the person who runs the house as a 

12
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:45,801
tyrant and then anyone who's sick in 
that house is sick because they're 

13
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:49,071
suffering from an excess of order and 
then you can walk into a house that's 

14
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:50,580
completely different and you can even 
see this in your own room if you want.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,560
Everything's in complete disarray.
You can't even look at that place.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,790
You're sick the moment you cross the 
threshold because everywhere you look,

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,440
there's parts of an transforms,
chaos yelling to you,

18
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,710
do something about this loser.
