1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,130
The best way,
the best way to teach people critical 

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,441
thinking is to teach them to write,
and I made this little thing that I put 

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:07,540
online.
It's,

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,110
I don't know if maybe it is it in the 
psych for 34 website.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,750
Did I post that rubric for Essay 
Writing?

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,860
It is still on.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,070
Is it not on for 34.
Is that not working

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,630
when you were doing?

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:22,700
Oh

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:23,890
yeah.

11
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,230
Oh,
okay.

12
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,790
Well there's an essay.
Whoa,

13
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,000
that's too bad.
It's not on the site for 34 website even

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,410
because I updated it anyways.
I have this guide to writing this.

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,870
If it isn't on the 4:34
website,

16
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:43,871
it is definitely on the [inaudible] 
website and it steps people through the 

17
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:46,610
process of writing because what's 
happened now,

18
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:49,820
it's very hard to teach people to write 
because it's unbelievably time intensive

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,960
and like writing marketing a good essay.
That's really easy.

20
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,630
Check a.
You did everything right,

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,430
right.
Marketing a bad essay.

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,350
Oh my God.
The words are wrong.

23
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,000
The phrases are wrong.
The sentence is wrong.

24
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,650
They're not ordered right in the 
paragraphs.

25
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,560
The paragraphs aren't coherent and the 
whole thing makes no sense,

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,010
so trying to tell the person what they 
did wrong.

27
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:10,550
It's like,
Whoa,

28
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:13,340
you did everything wrong.
Everything about this essay is wrong.

29
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,770
Well,
that's not helpful either.

30
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,770
You have to find the few little things 
they did half right and you have to 

31
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:25,841
teach them what they did wrong.
It's really expensive and so what I did 

32
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:29,990
with this rubric was trying to address 
that from the production side instead of

33
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:34,991
the grading side,
but the best thing you can do is teach 

34
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:36,260
people to write because there's no 
difference between that and thinking and

35
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:41,261
one of the things that just blows me 
away about universities is that no one 

36
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:43,220
ever tell students why they should write
something.

37
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,150
It's like,
well,

38
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:46,280
you have to do this assignment.
Well,

39
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:48,050
why are you writing well?
You need the grade.

40
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,920
It's like,
no,

41
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,760
you need to learn to think because 
thinking makes you act effectively in 

42
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,591
the world.
Thinking makes you win the battles you 

43
00:01:59,591 --> 00:01:59,591
undertake and those could be battles for
good things.

44
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:03,860
If you can think and speak and write,
you are absolutely deadly.

45
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,700
Nothing can get in your way,
so that's why you learn to write.

46
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,730
It's like when I can't believe that 
people aren't just told that it's,

47
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,950
it's,
it's like it's the most powerful weapon 

48
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,880
you could possibly provide someone with 
and I mean,

49
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:23,420
I know lots of people who've been 
staggeringly successful and watched them

50
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:25,400
throughout my life.
I mean those people,

51
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,960
you don't want to have an argument with 
them.

52
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,100
They'll just slash you into pieces and 
not in a malevolent way.

53
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:36,101
It's like if you're gonna make your 
point and they're going to make their 

54
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:38,921
point.
You better have your points organized 

55
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:41,890
because otherwise you are going to look 
like and be an absolute idiot.

56
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,170
You are not going to get anywhere.
And if you can formulate your arguments 

57
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,520
coherently and make a presentation,
if you can speak to people,

58
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,190
if you can lay out a proposal.
God,

59
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:54,650
people give you money,
they give you opportunities,

60
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,090
you have influence.
That's what you're at university for.

61
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,820
And so that's what you do is you know 
your urine English,

62
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:04,330
right?
You're in your new languages anyway.

63
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,320
So it's like,
yeah,

64
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,800
teach,
teach people to be articulate because 

65
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,860
that's the most dangerous thing you can 
possibly be.

66
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,110
So,
and that's motivating.

67
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,310
If people know that,
it's like,

68
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,050
well,
why are you learning to write?

69
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:18,760
Because your,
here's your sword,

70
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:20,530
here's your m 16,
right?

71
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:24,310
Here's your bulletproof vest.
Like you learn how to use them,

72
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,120
but it's just,

73
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,430
it's an endless mystery to me why that 
isn't made self evident.

74
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,320
So

75
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,280
that's the sort of thing that can drive 
you mad.

76
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:44,040
Trying to sort out.
It's like people are,

77
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,190
there's a,
there's a conspiracy to bring people 

78
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,190
into the education system to make them 
weaker.

79
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,330
So

80
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,890
I guess that keeps the competition down.
Maybe that's one way of thinking about 

81
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,240
it.
If your students are stupid,

82
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,410
they're not going to challenge you.
