1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Book called a billion wicked thoughts 
that was written by a bunch of engineers

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:08,010
at Google and they were looking at 
billions of search,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
uh,
billions of google searches and you 

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,951
know,
there's no shortage of pornography on 

5
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:16,290
the Internet and it,
and there's much less by proportion than

6
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,210
there was when the Internet was first 
invented.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,660
And it's so interesting because it 
actually turned out that one of the 

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,211
things that drove the development of the
Internet and the technology was the 

9
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:30,000
proclivity of young men to search out 
sexually provocative images.

10
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,820
That was what was at the forefront of 
the development of the nets.

11
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:35,850
Extraordinarily interesting.
They were motivated to,

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,940
they were motivated to use it for that 
purpose.

13
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:41,670
And that provided the platform from 
which it emerged.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,620
Amazing.
Anyways,

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,550
the Google engineers looked at 
pornographic search processes and then 

16
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,070
segregated male searches from female 
searches.

17
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:58,071
And what they found was that the mail 
search out images probably surprise no 

18
00:00:58,071 --> 00:00:58,350
one,
no one considers that,

19
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,120
you know,
particularly interesting.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,660
But the female searched out literary 
representations of pornography.

21
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:06,780
It was written.
So I can give you an example of that.

22
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:10,620
If you know about harlequin romances,
does everybody still know about those?

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,900
Anybody not know about those?
Okay.

24
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:17,901
Well there are mass market romances and 
have a very stereotypical type and 

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,900
they're.
The original ones were pretty harmless 

26
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,350
in terms of no violence and no real 
sexual contact con content,

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,710
but that was 40 years ago and they've 
differentiated tremendously and now 

28
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,840
there's hardcore harlequin romances and 
with,

29
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,690
with particularly garish covers.
And then there's the old,

30
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,730
you know,
more tame basic sexless and aggression 

31
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,240
list romances where everything is 
implied and not explicit,

32
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,920
but the explicit ones exist.

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,850
So they did a plot analysis of the 
typical pornographic female fantasy.

34
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,190
Well,
and it was.

35
00:01:56,191 --> 00:02:01,191
So,
it's so comical because engineers did 

36
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:03,381
this and social scientists would never 
do this because they'd be probably too 

37
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:04,200
concerned about the ethics of it or some
damn thing.

38
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,440
But engineers,
you know,

39
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,500
they'll just plow ahead with no concern 
whatsoever for such things and they 

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,660
actually discover things that way.
And so they,

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,840
they discovered the basic plot of the 
female pornographic literary product and

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,320
they identified.
So basically what happened was that a 

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,250
innocent well meaning and attractive 
young woman encounters a male who's a 

44
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,201
bit of a monster and the monster.
There's five types of classic male 

45
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:37,341
monster for all your males who want to 
know this is what you can become a 

46
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:38,190
vampire.
That's a good one.

47
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,340
We're wolf,
billionaire pirate and surgeon.

48
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,580
Okay.
So that's very interesting because.

49
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,830
Well first of all there's a dominance 
thing.

50
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,350
There's a.
Now you're actually blushing.

51
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:54,060
You know,
you're actually blushing about that.

52
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:55,320
That's very,
very funny.

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,310
So sorry to point it out,
but it's so comical,

54
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,790
you know?
I know,

55
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,080
I know.
It's so funny.

56
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,030
I was reading this,
I was reading this.

57
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:05,800
It was just cracking me up.
I thought,

58
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,060
oh my God,
really?

59
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,110
Pirate Vampire,
all of that explains it.

60
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,140
What about all these damn vampire shows 
right there?

61
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,090
So popular online.
There are so popular on Netflix.

62
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:17,560
Oh yes.
And then there's the war wolf.

63
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:20,170
There's nothing sexier than a werewolf 
apparently,

64
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,570
but I mean,
so there's predatory dope.

65
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:24,720
There's predatory dominance that's 
implicit in that,

66
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:26,110
right?
With a billionaire,

67
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,200
it's more abstract,
but clearly that's an indication of very

68
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:31,720
high success in the male dominance 
hierarchy,

69
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:36,721
so,
but there's this desire for aggression 

70
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:37,060
that's in that are real aggression,
right,

71
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,500
and it's not surprising to me,
to me at all,

72
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:42,290
it makes perfect sense,
but what?

73
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,360
But the basic plot is that the woman 
encounters this mysterious and 

74
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,920
aggressive male and teams.
That's the female hero myth as far as I 

75
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:59,971
can tell,
it's beauty and the beast and so it's 

76
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:01,340
because,
well,

77
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,380
there's no fun in taming someone who's 
already tame and what makes you think 

78
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:06,940
you really want someone who's taken many
ways.

79
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,580
There's no interest in that.
Plus when,

80
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,700
when,
when chaos manifests itself,

81
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:18,270
what makes you think that someone tame 
is going to be good for anything and 

82
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,920
it's a real question and so that 
aggression is absolutely vital.

83
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:25,921
It's absolutely necessary,
but because it's in incredibly 

84
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:26,560
dangerous,
which of course it is,

85
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,770
it has to be civilized.
And so what happens is that the 

86
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,130
archetypal female in these pornographic 
romances,

87
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,980
seduces and tames,
the aggressive male,

88
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,000
and that's her encounter with chaos.
Now it's more,

89
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,520
it's more complicated.
Of course,

90
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:47,521
females,
they're more complicated and that's 

91
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,231
exactly how it is and it's no wonder 
because there their lives are more 

92
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:49,231
complicated,
but okay.
