1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,250
Well,
so then Japan,

2
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:03,050
oh,
shows up and he's a kindly old guy,

3
00:00:03,051 --> 00:00:05,660
which is pretty much exactly what you'd 
expect and you know,

4
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:10,661
he,
he's a careful craftsman and he likes 

5
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:12,611
kittens and you know,
that's always a good thing and he has 

6
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:17,561
some fish and I know he's and he's good 
at making things and he's got a sense of

7
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:19,640
humor and he's kind of playful and so 
he's,

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,080
he's a,
he's a good father.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,330
Fundamentally.
He's the wise king.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,910
He's the positive archetype of the 
masculine.

11
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:31,290
That's what he is and so he's culture 
and it's positive manifestation and he 

12
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,320
gives rise to this creation which is his
puppet,

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,320
which is what culture does because 
you're a puppet of your culture.

14
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:41,321
You're a Marionette of your culture,
and so maybe you could be more than 

15
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:41,321
that.

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,390
And that's the other thing that's 
strange about this movie and it's 

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,691
strange about the mythological way of 
looking at the world because 

18
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:52,371
scientifically deterministically,
there's nature and there's culture and 

19
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:57,720
you are the deterministic product of the
interaction between nature and culture.

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,750
There's nothing else to you than that.
That's that.

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,480
But the mythological world doesn't say 
that.

22
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:08,481
It says something different,
it says that there's nature and culture 

23
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:12,260
and then there's you and the you that's 
in there has choices and the destiny and

24
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:19,161
that you actually affect the interplay 
of nature and culture in determining 

25
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:22,761
your own character.
And it insists upon that the oldest 

26
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:26,451
stories we have,
there's always the hero and the 

27
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:26,750
archetypal mother and the archetype 
father.

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,670
There's always those three things.
There's never just two.

29
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,940
So from the narrative perspective,
there's always the implication that 

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,681
there is something autonomous about the,
the hero of the story and you know,

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,590
you can't account for that.
We don't have a good way of accounting 

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,860
for that from a scientific perspective.
I was having a discussion with Sam 

33
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,340
Harris the other day,
which was very,

34
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,550
um,

35
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,480
what would you say?
He said we got wrapped around an axle,

36
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:59,540
which is pretty much has.
Sam Harris is one of the four famous,

37
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:02,750
you know,
atheists along with Christopher Hitchens

38
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:06,860
and Richard Dawkins and Dan Dennett.
Yeah.

39
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:09,220
And so we were having a discussion and 
um,

40
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,350
he's a determinist just right down to 
the bottom.

41
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:14,690
It's like you're determined,
you're determined.

42
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:19,691
There's no freewill.
You're a deterministic machine and you 

43
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:20,960
know if you're a coherent scientist and 
you're a Newtonian,

44
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,020
roughly speaking,
you don't really have much choice other 

45
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,541
than to think that way,
but that isn't how it seems to people 

46
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:32,140
and we don't treat each other that way 
and our entire legal system is 

47
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,100
predicated on the idea that you do in 
fact have freewill,

48
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,380
so well.
Can we account for it?

49
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,280
Well,
no,

50
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,410
and do we have a scientific model for 
it?

51
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,290
No,
but then I would also say we do not have

52
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,030
a scientific model for consciousness.

53
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,730
We don't know a damn thing about 
consciousness,

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
which is why Dan Dan book,
which was called consciousness 

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
explained,
was referred to.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,250
It's by it's critics as consciousness 
explained a way,

57
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,700
which is exactly right as far as I'm 
concerned because he took a mechanistic 

58
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,530
and I just don't think you get to do 
that because there's something really 

59
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,080
weird about consciousness.
I mean the phenomenologists Heidegger,

60
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,280
who tried to radically transform western
philosophy right from the bottom up.

61
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:13,390
He basically said,
well,

62
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,750
you know,
you can treat the world as if 

63
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,200
consciousness is primary and that human 
experience is reality.

64
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:25,201
That's reality and that he doesn't exist
independently of consciousness in any 

65
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,130
explicable way.
It's like,

66
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:28,180
well,
what's out there?

67
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:32,080
If there's nothing to to experience it 
while everything at once.

68
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,310
It's something like that.
It's.

69
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,580
It's not really comprehensible as 
without a subject that subject defines 

70
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:38,890
it and makes it real.

71
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,410
Now you don't have to believe that,
but,

72
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,740
but at least I'm telling you that there 
are thoroughly coherent philosophical 

73
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:51,181
positions that make that case very 
strongly and that that allow 

74
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:56,161
consciousness to exist as a phenomena 
and to take it seriously and you 

75
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:57,130
certainly act like you take it 
seriously.

76
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:02,131
You Act like there's a you and that you 
make choices and you certainly treat 

77
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:04,270
other people that way.
Deterministic or not,

78
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:09,271
you're still going to get angry when 
they're being rude to you and you're 

79
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:09,550
going to act as if they had some choice 
in the matter.

80
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,010
Now,
maybe that's an illusion possibly,

81
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,220
but maybe it's not,
and I would say the oldest stories that 

82
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,320
we have always include that as not only 
as a fundamental element,

83
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:22,630
but even as the fundamental element.
