1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,870
It's because the bloody intellectual 
leftists have never apologized for their

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,540
complicity in the catastrophes of the 
20th century.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,980
The Germans apologized.
Sorry about the Nazis.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,750
Well,
the left wing intellectuals,

5
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:13,110
they say,
well,

6
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:13,980
well,
that was real.

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,690
That wasn't real Marxism.
It's like,

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,440
oh,
okay.

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,500
How many carbs does have to pile up 
around you before you're willing to 

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,191
question your beloved ideological 
presuppositions and face your resentment

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,210
and your narcissism and your desire for 
destruction.

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,720
You don't like people anyways.
The planet has too many of them,

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,690
so like a nice warm.
I cleared out.

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,780
Well then all the plants can grow again.
You know the club of Rome,

15
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,670
when they talked about the population 
explosion that was going to wipe out the

16
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:49,671
planet by the year 2000,
they say outright that human beings are 

17
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:50,280
a cancer on the planet.
Lots of people think that.

18
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,120
It's like,
oh boy,

19
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,750
next put the atom bomb a phone in your 
hands.

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,220
Human beings are a cancer on the planet.
What a hell of a thing to say?

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,820
You're saying that to a four year old.
I saw bloody professor at Queen's 

22
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,140
University.
Tell a whole room full of 18 year olds 

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,360
that if they had an ethical fiber in 
their body,

24
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:14,361
they wouldn't have any kids or they only
have one because all they're doing is 

25
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:15,690
going out there and raping the planet.
It's like,

26
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,100
what?
You know,

27
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:18,630
what the hell?
What?

28
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,660
I don't understand that.
It's like human beings are hard on the 

29
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,811
planet,
but it's pretty damn hard on us in 

30
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:26,811
return.
You know?

31
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:28,890
It's like we're just sort of trying not 
to die to miserably and we make a bit of

32
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:29,490
a mess.
Well,

33
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:30,300
doing it.
It's like,

34
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:31,520
yeah,
Chris,

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,830
we've only known for 50 years that we 
were disrupting the oceans.

36
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,390
How fast do you think we can learn in 
100 years ago,

37
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,150
Thomas Huxley,
who was a great biologist,

38
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:45,050
said,
the oceans are so plentiful.

39
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,420
It was not a chance we could ever put a 
dent in them.

40
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,370
So there's only 100 years ago.
Fifty years ago we thought,

41
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:55,371
Oh man,
there's more of us and we're better at 

42
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:55,371
this than we thought.
So like,

43
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:56,310
okay,
how fast do you expect people to learn?

44
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,500
You know,
one generation,

45
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:01,170
one year,
we're trying to do our best.

46
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,230
Most.
Most people are trying to do their best 

47
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,510
and some people are trying to do their 
worst,

48
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:11,511
but most people are trying to do their 
best and so we should have a little 

49
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:14,721
compassion,
a little sympathy for human beings 

50
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:16,410
instead of considering ourselves like 
raping patriarchal,

51
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,710
oppressive destroyers of the world.
She's this.
