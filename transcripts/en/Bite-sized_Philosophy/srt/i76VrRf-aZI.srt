1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,240
You know,
Louis Ck,

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,290
a while back talked about Tiger Woods,
which I really liked it because people 

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,660
were complaining about Tiger Woods in 
his affairs.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,570
Yeah.
And also about our Arnold Schwarzenegger

5
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,240
in his affairs.
And um,

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,850
and one of the things that Louis Ck 
pointed out quite in a very comical 

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,591
manner was that,
well many men aren't having the affairs 

8
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:30,090
of Tiger Woods,
but that's not because they're good man.

9
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,040
It's because they don't have,
I think he said,

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,430
a busload of Swedish Swedish bikini 
models waiting for them at the final 

11
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:43,131
hole.
So the idea would be that you should 

12
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:46,680
conduct yourself so that you are 
attractive to many women.

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,550
Maybe that you have your pick of the,
but then you should pick one.

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,540
And that's a sacrifice.
Obviously that's a sacrifice of a sort.

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,200
It's a strange sacrifice because,
you know,

16
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,060
I,
I talked to someone,

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,710
a comedian recently who told me of one 
of his experiences in Las Vegas.

18
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,710
So he went to Las Vegas with a sports 
superstar and they went to a party.

19
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:17,151
And what literally happened at the party
was one woman brought forward a small 

20
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:24,111
group of other women.
All very attractive and basically told 

21
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:27,620
the sports legend that he could just 
pick one of them and she would go home 

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,660
with them.
Right?

23
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:30,480
And so that had all been arranged 
beforehand and he said that he's been in

24
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:34,590
many situations where something like 
that has happened and I thought,

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:35,970
well,
you know,

26
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:39,810
that sort of is appealing to the Hugh 
hefner playboy,

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,550
14 year old fantasy that sort of gripped
our culture from the 19 sixties onward.

28
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:48,670
But imagine that you sleep casually with
100 women in,

29
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,820
in,
in a six month period or three month 

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:53,820
period for that matter,
or a three week period.

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,830
I don't care.
Pick your timeframe and you say,

32
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,720
well,
what?

33
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,510
What?
You're,

34
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,580
you're,
you're ecstatic with yourself because 

35
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,270
you've been validated by this 
opportunity and I'm not making light of 

36
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,711
that.
It's not nothing to be attractive to 

37
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:15,501
women like that.
It's really something to be attractive 

38
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:17,991
to women like that,
but it isn't obvious to me that your 

39
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:23,061
choice to conduct yourself in that 
manner enriches your life and the life 

40
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:28,521
of other people more in any way than 
picking one person and actually having a

41
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:33,741
relationship with them.
It's only true that that promiscuous 

42
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:38,661
pathway,
let's say is better if you can actually 

43
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:40,470
divorce sexuality from all the other 
elements of life,

44
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,510
say well,
it's about variety and it's about 

45
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,480
impulsive pleasure or maybe it could be 
even slightly deeper than merely 

46
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,260
impulsive pleasure.
It can be shared,

47
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:50,250
impulsive,
pleasure,

48
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,640
but I don't think you can do that 
because sexuality isn't divorced from 

49
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,950
family and from morality and from all 
the other elements.

50
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Your life and if you're a mature,
you know that and so you make a 

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,050
decision.
You make a decision not to capitalize on

52
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:11,140
your opportunity,
not to misuse your opportunities and you

53
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,990
know,
a huge part of the me too phenomenon.

54
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,040
A huge part of this battle that's being 
played out in our culture is a 

55
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,611
consequence of the failure of men to 
recognize that now it's not only the 

56
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:29,161
failure of men.
Let me be absolutely clear about that 

57
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:31,981
because for example,
with the example of the sports 

58
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:35,761
superstar,
the women who are lining up in front of 

59
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:39,001
him,
parading themselves and offering 

60
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,150
themselves are deeply complicit in,
in this pathological game.

61
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,050
And so it's pretty clear 
anthropologically as well that,

62
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,620
you know,
sexual choice tends towards a prieto 

63
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:49,840
distribution,
especially for men.

64
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:54,841
So most men have very little selection 
at their disposal disposal and a small 

65
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:59,860
number of men have excess opportunities.

66
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,040
The question is what should that small 
number of men do?

67
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,090
And you might say capitalize on it and 
to hell with the consequences.

68
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,980
And like it's a powerful argument,
but I do believe it's wrong.

69
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,640
It destabilizes the society.
And so,

70
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:20,641
and I also don't think it does your soul
any good because the problem with 

71
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:22,600
treating other people as casual sexual 
partners,

72
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,730
let's say,
is that you also treat yourself that way

73
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,460
simultaneously.
And I don't think that that does you any

74
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:31,240
good because you're not.
Unless that's what you want to be.

75
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,240
If you want to be a casual partner,
it's like,

76
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,140
wow,
that's.

77
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,140
I wouldn't say that's a particularly 
noble ambition.

78
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,270
You should be able to do better than 
that.
