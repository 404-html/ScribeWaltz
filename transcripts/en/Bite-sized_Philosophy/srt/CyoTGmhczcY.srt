1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,660
Another taboo is to celebrate European 
culture.

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,190
Multiculturalists get pretty unhappy 
when Europeans start expressing pride in

3
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:15,220
their culture or heritage.
Many especially on the left,

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,490
do not draw much of a distinction,
at least in practice between European 

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,781
pride and white supremacy.
You care about freedom of the 

6
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:26,950
individual,
the individual's freedom to think,

7
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:29,200
to speak,
to associate in short,

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,680
to act as he sees fit without external 
compulsion,

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,220
as long as he doesn't infringe on the 
similar liberties of others.

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,970
Professor Ricardo do a historical 
sociologists and professor at the 

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,930
University of New Brunswick argues that 
quote,

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,670
individualism is a unique attribute of 
European peoples.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,320
Quote,
it has been exported to some degree to 

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,320
other nations,
but in my view,

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,620
it is not something that comes to them 
naturally,

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,550
so he continues.
Quote,

17
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,100
you can't play the game of we're all 
individuals.

18
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,610
We have to affirm and be proud of our 
ethnic identity and heritage to preserve

19
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:14,011
the West's curious individualism.
If Europeans have become minorities in 

20
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:18,220
the west,
he argues the founding idea of the West,

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,770
that no entity,
not an individual,

22
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:23,190
not a community,
not the state congested.

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,690
We deprive an individual of life,
liberty,

24
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:28,960
or property by force,
no matter what the individual's race,

25
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:30,010
class or religion.

26
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,930
I wouldn't be surprised if Dushane when 
he made this statement,

27
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:35,920
had you in mind.

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,940
Look,
the

29
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,950
medieval Europeans identified seven 
deadly sins for reason and one of them 

30
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:49,990
was pride.
It's like,

31
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:55,830
let's make the presumption.
I do believe that for for reasons that 

32
00:01:56,141 --> 00:02:00,880
aren't obvious that the west has got 
some things right.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,250
We've got the sovereignty of the 
individual,

34
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:08,251
right?
That's the most fundamental thing we've 

35
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:08,251
got,
right?

36
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:09,910
We've articulated that I think in a,
in a remarkable way,

37
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:14,911
not only theologically,
philosophically in her body of laws and 

38
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:19,891
our societies,
and one of the consequences of that as 

39
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,360
it's had its effect on the rest of the 
world is that everyone is getting richer

40
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:24,790
quite fast and that's a really good 
thing.

41
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,100
Okay.
Having said that,

42
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:28,450
it's like,
am I proud of that?

43
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,370
It's like,
I didn't do that.

44
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,370
What the hell?
Pride.

45
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,330
What's that?
That's not the right response.

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,270
How about responsibility for that?
How would that be?

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,060
It's like you're a part of.
This is great.

48
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:43,810
Okay,

49
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,950
and unlikely set of propositions,
this strange set of propositions that 

50
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,811
says that in some ineffable manner,
the poorest person is as valuable as the

51
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,030
king.
It's like,

52
00:02:58,031 --> 00:02:59,770
how the hell did we ever figure that 
out?

53
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,130
That's an impossible thing to think and 
yet that's the.

54
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,000
That's the bedrock of our legal system.
That's nothing to be proud of.

55
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,180
That's something to tremble before to 
take on as an ethical burden and not to 

56
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:18,031
wave a flag for how wonderful you are 
that you happen to have the same skin 

57
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,480
color as some of the people who thought 
that up.

58
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,870
It's not the right response.
It's like it's open your eyes and 

59
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,831
recognize that as a miracle and a 
relatively relatively new miracle on the

60
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:34,501
world stage and to and to participate in
the process of upholding that in your 

61
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:38,940
personal and your public life.
That's not pride in European tradition.

62
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Like when I go to Europe and I love 
going to Europe and the European cities 

63
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,971
are there unbelievable masterpieces,
which is why they're completely flooded 

64
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:49,060
by pilgrims,
right?

65
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Tourists,
pilgrims who go there to look at the 

66
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,700
beauty,
so I don't feel pride about that.

67
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,940
I feel,
I feel like I have something to live up 

68
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,520
to that's not the same thing,
man,

69
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,100
and so these right wingers in this,
it's like,

70
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:04,510
look what we've done.
It's like,

71
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,940
no,
it's not you that did that.

72
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,990
That's something mad you gotta you gotTa
have your act together before you would 

73
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:12,990
dare to say,
well,

74
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,720
that was me.
It's like,

75
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:14,470
yeah,
sure,

76
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,060
sure it was you.
Yeah,

77
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:17,590
right.
No,

78
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,430
it's hard to stand up and take your 
place in that,

79
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,240
in that kind of historical process,
that unlikely,

80
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:30,241
miraculous historical process,
not to just feel ashamed at the way that

81
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:35,281
you're presently constituted in the face
of that means that you're diluted and 

82
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,860
you're using your,
your your great fortune of being a 

83
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:44,500
beneficiary of that system.
Look at what we've got here,

84
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,620
this great pace that we're inhabiting 
right now.

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,800
You're using your unearned,
the unearned gift that's been granted to

86
00:04:56,051 --> 00:05:01,051
you as a source of personal pride in 
your accomplishments do to your skin.

87
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,370
It's like,
no,

88
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,160
not good.
Not a good argument.

89
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,910
So and that doesn't mean that while 
there's nothing valuable about European 

90
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,150
culture,
there's plenty.

91
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,870
There's plenty about it that's value.
It's not even so clear to what degree 

92
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,780
it's European.
I mean it came out of the Middle East,

93
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:24,781
you know,
mean who it's so muddle headed that you 

94
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:26,020
hardly know where to start.
