1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:06,210
People even now,
because it's the 100th anniversary of 

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,660
the Russian revolution,
are celebrating Lennon.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,520
It's like,
that's not good.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,910
That's like celebrating Hitler.
Okay,

5
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:16,780
I'm dead serious about that.
It's not good,

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,080
and the fact that people can dare to 
think that that's okay means that 

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,460
there's something wrong with the way 
that we look at history.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,660
Lennon was a monster and if you want to 
know about that,

9
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:33,661
you can read Solzhenitsyn's writings 
about lending because they communist 

10
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:33,661
apologists say,
well,

11
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:35,050
it wasn't landing.
Len was a good guy.

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,840
He was all motivated by love of the 
working class.

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,710
It's like,
well,

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,030
his henchmen was stolen and if you're 
Hansman is Stellan,

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,390
you're not a good guy and lender who was
around during the early collectivization

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,200
and if you read what he wrote,
you'll find out that he is perfectly 

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,021
willing to have any number of people die
as long as his ideological system could 

18
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:00,790
be brought into big.
So there's no celebrating Lennon.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There's no work,
cool young Marxist hip revolutionaries 

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,470
and he's our idol.
It's like there's none of that.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,490
Not if you know anything,
not if you're decent,

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,900
whether it's death of the Kulaks I told 
you about that there was the Ukrainian 

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:19,940
famine.
That's 6 million gone there.

24
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,090
There was the rise of the Gulag state 
because it turned out that Russia,

25
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,170
the Soviet Union couldn't run on the 
principles that it had that had,

26
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:31,310
had a laid down as sacrosanct that just 
didn't work.

27
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:34,220
So he had to enslave everybody and run 
your economy

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,100
as a slave state essentially.

29
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,050
And try not to kill the people in the 
gulags so fast that you can't suck some 

30
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,790
productive labor out of them is the 
death of tens of millions of people.

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,850
We don't even know the estimates range 
from 15 to $60 million and like we won't

32
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:59,571
get it to Picayune about the numbers 
because after the first 10 million you 

33
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:03,381
kinda made your point and the fact that 
we don't know between 15 and 60 is 

34
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:04,950
actually an indication.
Yeah,

35
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,990
of the horror of it because our count is
off by tens of millions and that's only 

36
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,870
within the last century.
And then there was the 1956 crackdown on

37
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,500
Hungary and the 1968 invasion of 
Czechoslovakia.

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Then there was the whole like thermo 
nuclear Holocaust thing that was going 

39
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,230
on at the same time,
and the fact that in 1962 and in 1984,

40
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,070
we were seconds away from complete 
annihilation,

41
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:39,071
right during the Cuban missile crisis,
the keys were in the intercontinental 

42
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:42,020
ballistic missile release systems.
And Castro,

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,250
as he admitted to Jimmy Carter in case 
any of you are Castro fans,

44
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,670
which you shouldn't be,
that he was perfectly willing to have 

45
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,630
Cuba annihilated if it would've meant 
the defeat of the United States.

46
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,250
And then in 1984 approximately,
I may have the date exactly wrong,

47
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,700
the Russians received an indication from
their early warning systems that the 

48
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,691
Americans had launched five Thurman 
Nuclear Missiles and one Russian decided

49
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:15,830
that it was a mistake and refused to 
launch the retaliation.

50
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,400
And he just died about two weeks ago.
So,

51
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:21,650
you know,
that was pretty close.

52
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,120
And uh,
so that was experiment number one.

53
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:28,220
Let's say that that wasn't good,
that experiment,

54
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,750
let's put it that way.
It wasn't good.

55
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,810
It was exactly the antithesis of good.
It was precisely the antithesis of good,

56
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,210
but that wasn't all.
I mean,

57
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,350
there's the People's Republic of China.
That's a different country,

58
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,940
like seriously,
a different country,

59
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:48,380
right?
Different tradition,

60
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,550
different language.

61
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,900
How many people died in China under Mao?
No one knows.

62
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Same issue with the Soviet Union.
Although mile was a bigger monster than 

63
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,630
Stalin and that's.
That's impressive.

64
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,930
You know,
because there's Hitler,

65
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:12,210
there's Stalin and Mao and of the three 
mile was probably the worst.

66
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,690
He's still revered in China.
Maybe that accounts for their affinity 

67
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,650
for North Korea,
which could still destroy us.

68
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:24,651
All the remnants of that horrible state.
Maybe a 100 million people died in China

69
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,730
during the great leap forward.
That's a hell of a leap forward.

70
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,350
Well,
maybe it wasn't a 100 million,

71
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:33,090
you know,
maybe it was only $40 million,

72
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,300
but as I said before,
when you're counting in the tens of 

73
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,321
millions of your points already made,
and then there was Cambodia and the 

74
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:46,161
killing fields and Bulgaria and east 
Germany and Romania and the Democratic 

75
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:51,020
People's Republic of Korea.
That's North Korea and Vietnam and 

76
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Ethiopia.
Hungary,

77
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,110
et Cetera,
et Cetera,

78
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,170
et cetera.
There was never a successful communist 

79
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,700
state.
Cuba,

80
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,920
I suppose,
came closest,

81
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:01,180
but it was radically,

82
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,040
um,

83
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,960
the Soviets poured money into Cuba.
So that doesn't really count.

84
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,650
So then the first question was,
well,

85
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:16,800
are these Marxists motivated by love or 
hatred?

86
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,960
Well,

87
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,080
is it love or hatred that produces $100,
million dead people?

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,210
Is that enough evidence or not?
And if it's not enough evidence,

89
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,350
if you think to yourself,
well,

90
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:36,160
that's not enough evidence,
it was never really given its proper,

91
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,400
a proper try.

92
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,810
It's like,
well,

93
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,930
why would have been a proper try to.
I always think when I hear someone say 

94
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,870
that I know what you think,
you think in your delusional arrogance,

95
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:57,130
that you understand the Marxist 
doctrines better than anyone else ever 

96
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,191
has,
and that if you were one implementing 

97
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,760
those doctrines,
you would have ushered in the utopia.

98
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,390
That's what you mean when you say that 
and no,

99
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,370
they're there.
They saying there's an idea in the new 

100
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:14,670
testament that there is a sin.
It's a sin against the holy ghost.

101
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,750
If you commit that sand,
no one really knows what it is that you 

102
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,060
can't be forgiven,
and I would say,

103
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:27,061
well,
if you want a candidate for the sin 

104
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:27,580
against the Holy Ghost and the 21st 
century,

105
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,730
the statement communism,
real communism was never tried with the 

106
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:40,771
underlying idea that if you had been the
person implementing it would have 

107
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:43,780
worked.
I think that's pretty good contender for

108
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:46,000
something for which you should never be 
forgiven.
