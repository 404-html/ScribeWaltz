1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,460
So there's,
there's the distribution of scores.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,160
Now that's dismal,
dismal thing to look at.

3
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:09,240
You have to understand that why look at 
this zero,

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,780
right?
The median person has not done anything 

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,050
creative ever in their life with 
anything on any dimension,

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,390
right?
It's really important to know that.

7
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:20,280
And then you have these horrible people 
out here,

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,490
right?
They do everything.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,860
They do everything.
Price's law.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,890
Here's price's law.
This is something to hammer into your 

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,501
heart.
The square root of the number of people 

12
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:34,260
in a domain do 50 percent of the work.
Okay?

13
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:35,430
So let's,
let's go through that.

14
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,170
You have 10 employees,
three of them do,

15
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,780
half the work makes sense.
That's reasonable.

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,260
You have 100 employees,
10 of them do half the work.

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,880
That's a problem.
So the other 90 percent are doing the 

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,650
other half who cares about them?
And you have 10,000

19
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:52,290
employees,
100 of them do half the work,

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,310
right?

21
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,260
So here's a.
here's a nasty little law.

22
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,980
As your company grows in,
competence grows exponentially and 

23
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,050
competence grows linearly.
Got It right?

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,660
Because it with 10,
it's three who are doing half the work,

25
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:08,910
but at 10,000
it's 100 that are doing half the work,

26
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:13,911
so 9,900
of your employees are doing as much as 

27
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:17,481
the best 100.
You might not even know who the best 

28
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:20,301
$100,
but probably they know and maybe their 

29
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:22,911
peers know too.
And so one of the things that's really 

30
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:22,911
interesting when big companies start to 
shake,

31
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:24,450
which means maybe they've had a bad 
quarter,

32
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,350
two bad quarters and the stock price 
starts to tip down and the people,

33
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,530
the hot people who have options,
they're not very happy about that and 

34
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,861
maybe they start to announce layoffs.
All 100 people who have opportunities 

35
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:37,650
leave and they're the ones who were 
doing half the work.

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,690
So boy,
that puts your company in a pretty rough

37
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:42,570
situation because now you've got the 
9,900

38
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:47,571
people left over who were only doing 
half the work and the next time you 

39
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:49,260
announce layoffs,
the next most productive hundred leave.

40
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,550
And so then you're left with nobody who 
is productive at a massive overhead.

41
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:58,551
Payroll price's law.
You can look that up to solar price to 

42
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:02,690
solar.
Price is a guy who was looking at 

43
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,031
scientific productivity and one of the 
things he found was when he was looking 

44
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:08,331
at Phd students is that the median 
number of publications for a phd 

45
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:10,950
graduate when he did his work,
which was in the early sixties,

46
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,820
was one half as many,
had two,

47
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,940
half as many as that had three,
half as many as that had four.

48
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,050
It's a real step down and one of the 
corollaries of that is that there's a 

49
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,391
certain number of people who are hyper 
productive and that's these people out 

50
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:28,470
here and if you were graphing the 
distribution,

51
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,590
let's say you graft,
how many people in our population of 

52
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:33,590
300,
$10,000

53
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,700
in a savings account,
it would look very much like this.

54
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,600
Some of them would have some of them,
some of them would.

55
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,060
Most people would have no savings 
whatsoever.

56
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,990
The median person would have no savings 
whatsoever and then you go up here where

57
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,730
the one percent is.
They have all the money,

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but the thing that you want to 
understand about that one percent issue 

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,151
that you always hear about is that it 
applies in every single realm where 

60
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:57,180
there's difference in creative 
production.

61
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,380
Every realm,
it doesn't matter.

62
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,630
Number of records produced,
number of records sold,

63
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:03,910
number of compositions written.
So here's,

64
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,940
here's an example,
five composers produce the music that 

65
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,800
occupies 50 percent of the classical rep
repertoire,

66
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,790
right?
Bach,

67
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,050
Beethoven,
Brahms,

68
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,570
Tchaikovsky,
Mozart.

69
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,650
That's right,
those five.

70
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:19,030
Okay,
so here's something cool.

71
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,120
So you take all the music.
Those people wrote five percent of the 

72
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,811
music,
all those people wrote occupies 50 

73
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:29,170
percent of the music that have their 
writing that's played.

74
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,770
So not only do,
almost all of the composers never get 

75
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,920
allison,
but even among the composers do get a 

76
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:37,920
list and almost none of their music ever
gets played.

77
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,220
So.
So then that's it.

78
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,240
That's it.
Another example of this price's law 

79
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,140
scaling.
So when it applies to all sorts of 

80
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,140
things,
like number of hockey goal scored,

81
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,210
who's also a distributed this way,
number of basketball,

82
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,450
basketball basketball's successfully put
through the who follows the same 

83
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,420
distribution,
uh,

84
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,790
size of cities follows the same 
distribution.

85
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,720
It's a weird,
it's a weird law and you can think about

86
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:05,500
it in part.
Why does this happen while,

87
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:07,090
imagine what happens when you play 
monopoly?

88
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,350
What happens?
Everybody has the same amount of money 

89
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,350
to begin with,
right?

90
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,640
So then you start playing.
It's basically a random game while some 

91
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,220
people start to wind a bit,
some people start to lose a bit.

92
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,120
And then if you win probability that 
you'll keep winning starts to increase.

93
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,630
And if you lose your vulnerability 
increases as you lose.

94
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,090
And then maybe you've got,
say six people playing monopoly,

95
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,770
soon.
One person has zero.

96
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,670
What happens when they have zero?
They're out of the game.

97
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,340
So zero is a weird number because when 
you hit zero,

98
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,470
you're out of the game.
So,

99
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,620
so then if you keep playing,
people start to stack up at zero,

100
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,750
right?
What happens at the end of the game?

101
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,490
One person has all the property and all 
the money and everyone else has none,

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,310
right?
That,

103
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:54,311
that's what happens if you play an 
iterated trading game to its final 

104
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:57,961
conclusion,
and that's part of the law in a sense 

105
00:04:57,961 --> 00:04:58,120
that's underlying this kind of 
distribution.

106
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,110
So it's really,
it's,

107
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,160
it's,
it's not a consequence necessarily of 

108
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,621
structural inequality.
It's built into the system at a deeper 

109
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:07,621
level than that.

110
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:08,650
So you know,
people talk about all the time about how

111
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:13,651
unfair it is that the one percent of the
population has the vast amount of the 

112
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:17,431
money and one percent of the one percent
has most of that money and one percent 

113
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:21,361
of the,
one percent of the one percent has most 

114
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:21,361
of that money.
But it is a,

115
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:25,530
it's a,
it's an inevitable conclusion of 

116
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:25,870
iterated trading games.
And we don't know how to fight it.

117
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:31,170
We don't know how to take from the 
people who have and move it to the 

118
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,890
bottom without instantly moving back up 
to the top.

119
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,220
Different people maybe,
but still back up to the top because 

120
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,641
even the one percent churns a lot.
Like I think you have a 10 percent 

121
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,340
chance,
if I remember correctly,

122
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:47,341
you have a 10 percent chance of being in
the top one percent for at least one 

123
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:51,121
year of your life and a 40 percent 
chance of being in the top 10 percent 

124
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:53,650
for at least one year in your life.
That's in Canada and the US,

125
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:56,950
it's less so in Europe,
so there's a fair bit of churning at the

126
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:59,320
top end.
It's not the same people all the time.

127
00:05:59,321 --> 00:06:04,321
We will have the money,
but it is a tiny fraction of the people 

128
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:04,321
all the time who have all the money.
