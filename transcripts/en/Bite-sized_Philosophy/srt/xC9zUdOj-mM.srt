1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,130
There's a psychologist named piaget,
some of you might know about him.

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,110
Piaget was very interested in what 
happens to value structures and their 

3
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:21,571
hierarchical organization once they have
to apply outside of the confines of a 

4
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:23,230
body.
So,

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,650
so here's a way of thinking about it.
Two year olds basically hypothalamic.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,050
That's why there's so much fun.
First they're happy,

7
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:30,310
then they're sad,
they're hungry,

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,380
then they're tired,
you know,

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,370
they just zipped from one pretty 
straightforward and rather are inspiring

10
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:40,360
motivational state to another and but at
two they can't play.

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,740
They can play with by themselves,
but they can't play with other children.

12
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:49,741
They can't get that until they're three 
and they need to get it by the time 

13
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:50,440
they're three because if they don't get 
it by the time,

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,510
therefore they will never get it.
And then you have an antisocial kid 

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,730
who's going to be an outsider for his 
entire life and there isn't anything you

16
00:00:57,731 --> 00:00:58,450
can do about it.

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,790
So that has to happen between two and 
four.

18
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,970
So what happens at about age three is 
that the kid learns how to play a game 

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,230
with another person.
And what that game is,

20
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:11,231
is fundamentally the development of the 
ability to share a frame of reference,

21
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,450
which is what you're doing when you play
monopoly.

22
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,600
It's like it's stupid to play monopoly,
obviously,

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,810
who cares if you have a whole pile of 
counterfeit paper,

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,200
right?
But doesn't matter because the way your 

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,051
constituted is that your brain will 
treat anything you acting like 

26
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,770
constitutes a valuable goal as if it's a
valid framework of reference.

27
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:34,060
And if it couldn't do that,
a,

28
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:39,061
you couldn't abstract and B,
you could not get along with other 

29
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:42,511
people.
So you can sit around the table and you 

30
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:44,791
can say,
let's pretend that monopoly is a 

31
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,080
reasonable facsimile of reality,
which you wouldn't say,

32
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,670
but it's what you mean.

33
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,780
And everybody says yes,
that would be a music.

34
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:58,110
And so then you set your goal,
which is to get all the little hotels 

35
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,940
and all the money and Poof,
your emotions go along for the ride.

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,600
And what's so interesting about that is 
you can get everybody into the game.

37
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:09,601
And so one of the things that's really 
interesting about people is that we can 

38
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:12,631
establish a shared fictional frame of 
reference and it organizes all our 

39
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:13,360
emotions.
So they're predictable.

40
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,930
That's also why we can watch movies.
You go to a movie,

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,570
you identify the hero,
you figure out what the hero wants,

42
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,340
proof you're the hero.
And the way that works is you don't look

43
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:28,330
at the hero and think about what he's 
doing and evaluated emotionally and then

44
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:33,331
feel it.
What you do is you specify the hero's 

45
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:36,211
goal and then you map them onto your 
body and you read off the emotional 

46
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:38,680
responses of your own body.
And that's how you understand the hero.

47
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,110
So it's an embodied,
you're,

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,120
you're using your,
your embodiment as a computational 

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,270
device that can run simulations of other
consciousnesses.

50
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,090
And it does that with the body.
And we like doing that.

51
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:56,530
You can go to a movie and you know,
you're Brad Pitt for an hour and a half.

52
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,050
You know,
when you're Brad Pitt doing remarkable 

53
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,861
things.
And that's also how we understand other 

54
00:03:04,861 --> 00:03:04,861
people were very good at that.
So anyways,

55
00:03:04,861 --> 00:03:07,360
we have these shared frames of reference
like when we're playing monopoly,

56
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,670
okay,
so children at three learn how to play 

57
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,500
games and that means they learn how to 
organize their own internal motivational

58
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:19,501
states into a hierarchy that includes 
the motivational states of other people 

59
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,810
and that means they can play.
And that's what you guys do when you're 

60
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,270
out in the world.
Like we're playing a game right now.

61
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,420
We all know the rules.
That's why we can all sit in this room 

62
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:30,610
and play the game without fighting with 
each other.

63
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,310
You know,
in the room is set up like a theater and

64
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:38,311
we all know the theater game and so.
And the chairs are all facing this way 

65
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:42,841
at the moment.
And so that's a hint that you should 

66
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:44,611
look forward and this is raised so you 
know the room is basically telling you 

67
00:03:44,611 --> 00:03:48,601
what to do because it's a stage like all
rooms and because you're smart and 

68
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:53,131
socially conscious,
you can walk into a stage room and your 

69
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:55,390
body knows what to do and if you're 
civilized and social you just do it.

70
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:00,390
Then all the other primates can predict 
what you're up to and they won't kill 

71
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,390
you.

72
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Yeah,
well that's what it means to be part of 

73
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,071
the same tribe.
You know when people are very peculiar 

74
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:08,200
creatures and God only knows what 
they're up to,

75
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,780
but as long as they're playing the same 
game you are.

76
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:15,781
You don't have to know what they're up 
to because you can predict what they're 

77
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:18,541
going to do and you understand their 
motivational states and so part of the 

78
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,590
building and constructing of higher 
order motive,

79
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,860
higher order moral goals is the 
establishment of joint frames of 

80
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,050
reference that allow multiple people to 
pursue the goals that they're interested

81
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,110
in simultaneously and then what you have
to think about with regards to that is 

82
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,030
that not all shared frames of reference 
can manage that.

83
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,300
There's a small subset of them that are 
optimized so that not only can multiple 

84
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,041
people play them,
but multiple people can play them and 

85
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,570
enjoy them and do it repeatedly across a
long period of time.

86
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,840
So it's integratability that partly 
defines the utility of a higher order 

87
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,220
moral structure and that is not 
arbitrary.

88
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,420
It's an emergent property of biological 
interactions and you might say,

89
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:09,421
well,
it's kind of arbitrary because people 

90
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:11,461
can do what they want,
but it's not arbitrary at all because a 

91
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:14,020
lot of what's constraining your games is
your motivational substructure and those

92
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:19,021
ancient circuits that are status 
oriented and they operate within 

93
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,360
virtually every animal has a status.
Counter creatures organize themselves 

94
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,251
into dominance hierarchies.
The reason they do that is because that 

95
00:05:29,251 --> 00:05:29,680
works.
It's a solution.

96
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:32,470
It's a solution to the Darwinian problem
of existence.

97
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,640
It's not just the nap and phenomena,
it's the real thing.

98
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,250
So you,
your environment,

99
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:44,251
fundamentally a huge chunk of your 
environment is dominance hierarchy plus 

100
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:48,300
God only knows where you are and that's 
the order in chaos and part of the 

101
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,501
reason that people fight to preserve 
their dominance hierarchies is because 

102
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:52,501
it's better to be a slave.

103
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:56,440
Who knows what the hell is going on than
someone who's thrown screaming and naked

104
00:05:56,441 --> 00:06:01,441
into the jungle night and that's the 
difference between order and chaos and 

105
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:06,190
we like order better than chaos and it's
no wonder now we'll invite a little 

106
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,560
chaos in for entertainment now and then,
but it has to be done voluntarily.

107
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,580
And generally you don't want the kind of
chaos that upsets your entire conceptual

108
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,640
structure.
You know,

109
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,000
you're willing to fool around on the 
fringes a little bit,

110
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,860
but you know when the going gets 
serious,

111
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:21,830
you're pretty much likely to bail out 
and no wonder.
