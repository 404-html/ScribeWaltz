00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,290
There's an old story about how to catch 
a monkey in case any of you are 

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,090
interested in how to catch a monkey.
Now you now you're going to know how to 

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:11,970
do it.
First you have to take a large,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,240
narrow neck jar just large enough in 
diameter at the top for a monkey to put 

5
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:22,701
a tanned inside.
Then you have to fill it partway with 

6
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:22,701
rocks so it's too heavy for the monkey 
to carry.

7
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:27,650
Then you scatter some treats near the 
jar to attract them and you put some 

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,250
inside inside the narrow neck.
Gr a monkey will come along if you're 

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,141
lucky and grabbed the goodies,
but he'll want the ones inside the jar 

10
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:42,441
too,
so then put his hand in there and grab 

11
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:45,140
what's in there.
And if you've set up your monkey truck 

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,931
properly,
then he won't be able to get his hand 

13
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:48,150
out because he's got the goodies.

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,220
Not Without unclenching his hand,
not without relinquishing what he 

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,971
already has.
The monkey coucher can just walk over 

16
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:02,031
and just pick up the monkey because the 
monkey isn't into the whole sacrifice 

17
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:05,010
thing because he's just a monkey.
You know?

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,090
And so you can catch him as a 
consequence of his own,

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,360
an regulated hypothalamic desires to be.
What would you say,

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,980
charitable to the Monkey,
if you put out candy or something like 

21
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,011
that.
So like how often does a monkey get 

22
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:26,451
candy?
He's probably a little more motivated 

23
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:26,580
than you are to not let go,
but you can get the point.

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,510
The monkey catcher can just walk over to
the jar and pick up the monkey.

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,360
The animal will not sacrifice the part 
for the whole.

26
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,280
That's actually a pretty good phrase.
Hey,

27
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,940
it's the animal that will not sacrifice 
the part for the whole.

28
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,030
Perhaps this story is apocryphal,
but as an eccentric psychology professor

29
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:49,080
once told me,
fiction lies to you in the most truth,

30
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,290
in the most truthful possible manner,
something valuable given up ensures 

31
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,030
future prosperity,
something valuable,

32
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,520
sacrificed,
pleases the Lord.

33
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,540
Those are equivalent statements.
One's more articulated.

34
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,860
I would say.
That's the first statement.

35
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:09,861
And the second one is more dramatic and 
more embedded in a collective religious 

36
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:09,960
dream.
You might say,

37
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,320
what's most valuable and best 
sacrificed?

38
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:18,321
Well,
obviously that depends on the culture 

39
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:19,350
and the time.
What is it least emblematic of that?

40
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:20,880
A choice cut of meat?
Well,

41
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:22,350
if you're a herdsmen,
for example,

42
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,450
that that's a big deal.
I mean,

43
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:26,190
generally speaking,
throughout human history,

44
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:28,800
meat has been a very valuable commodity 
as it is,

45
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:30,090
by the way,
among chimpanzees.

46
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,130
Chimpanzees hunt,
they like to hunt,

47
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:34,200
call us monkeys,
and you know,

48
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:39,201
they'll,
they'll basically start eating the damn 

49
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,361
monkey lie.
They weigh about 40 pounds despite the 

50
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,691
fact that the thing is screaming away,
and that's pretty interesting because 

51
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:47,020
one of the things that indicates is that
male monkeys mailchimp's,

52
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,250
they're the ones that do the hunting,
aren't really inhibited that much when 

53
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,470
they're in fear mode by what you might 
describe as empathy and there's certain 

54
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:00,130
elements of human behavior are 
reminiscent of that.

55
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:05,131
You see that sort of thing have merged 
now and then in human battlefields when 

56
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,230
groups of men seem to abandoned all 
internal regulation whatsoever,

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,510
to a degree that makes you wonder if 
internal regulation even exists.
