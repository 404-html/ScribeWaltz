1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,480
I've been struggling with an idea 
recently that I was thinking maybe you'd

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:08,481
be able to help me out with.
Basically in a recent interview you 

3
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:12,291
talked about how myth is meant to 
reconcile inherent contradictions in 

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,500
reality.
Right?

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,630
But I'm sort of stuck between two 
mythological or,

6
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:23,631
um,
psychoanalytic ideas that I think are 

7
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:26,360
both really important,
but they seem to have a inherent 

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:26,820
contradiction within them that I've been
trying to figure out.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,030
So on one hand you have this idea that 
there's times in your life where you 

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,901
have to identify things in yourself that
are insufficient or there's a problem 

11
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:40,220
somehow that you have to kind of have a 
controlled burn or like a phoenix like 

12
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:45,531
transformation where you discard part of
yourself that doesn't fit or it's not 

13
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:47,610
working.
But then on the other hand,

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,640
you have talked about this,
this union idea where as you become 

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,120
really,
when you get older,

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,760
you mature by reincorporating.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,260
Things about yourself that you lost when
you were younger or that you know you're

18
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:06,261
trying to integrate your shadow or 
you're trying to find parts of your 

19
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:07,800
personality that,
that maybe you've been rejecting and try

20
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,790
and figure out how to bring them into,
into the folder and the whole.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,760
So he's got this quote that I really 
like,

22
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:15,980
which is I'd rather be holding good.
Right,

23
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:17,010
right.
So,

24
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:22,011
so on one hand you may identify 
something as a problem and you want to 

25
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:24,990
get rid of it or burn it off.
But then on the other hand it seems like

26
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:29,991
the,
the path to being stronger is to figure 

27
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:32,340
out how to put everything together.

28
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,070
So there's the,
there's the,

29
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:39,410
one of the things you wrote about in his
works on Alchemy was an explanation of 

30
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:43,410
the prime l chemical dictum,
which was solvay Coagula,

31
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,560
which meant dissolve and integrate.
Right?

32
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:49,180
So,
so imagine this,

33
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:54,181
imagine that.
Imagine you had a fairly hostile father 

34
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,220
who was not very well controlled and his
aggression,

35
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,010
decent person.
Other than that.

36
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:02,650
But let's say that.
And so your reaction is,

37
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:07,651
I'm never going to be aggressive.
And so you've built a like a moral 

38
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:12,171
structure that's part of your 
personality and there's possibility 

39
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:14,710
floating around.
Outside of that,

40
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:17,070
did you.
You've denied an ethical,

41
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,050
you've denied any ethical.
What would you say?

42
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,550
You've stripped the idea of aggression 
of any ethical utility whatsoever.

43
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,260
Okay,
so what happens?

44
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:31,080
This burns off and then that comes back 
up.

45
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:36,081
Now you still have to integrate it.
So it's associated in some sense with 

46
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:36,600
niches,
ideas,

47
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,700
morality as cowardice.

48
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,090
Because one of the niches,
most trenchant critiques of traditional 

49
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,330
morality,
let's say,

50
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,140
is that most of what passes for morality
isn't reality.

51
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,260
It's just cowardice.
It's not that I'm a good person and I 

52
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,651
don't hurt you.
It's that I'm afraid to hurt you and 

53
00:02:57,651 --> 00:02:58,130
because I don't want to admit that I'm 
afraid to hurt you.

54
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,410
Then I say I'm moral because then I can 
mask my essential fear and cowardice in 

55
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,110
a guise of morality.
And that happens far more often than you

56
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:11,350
would think because harmless and moral 
are by no means the same thing.

57
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,040
So some of what you're burning off you 
can sit,

58
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,110
and this is where freud was such a 
genius,

59
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:20,110
I think is because he concentrated on 
aggression and sexuality,

60
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:25,111
which are perhaps the two most difficult
parts of a personality to integrate so 

61
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:25,880
that,
um,

62
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:32,070
the,
the hyper simplified morality stops you 

63
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,580
from tapping into deeper recesses of 
your psyche.

64
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,730
And it's partly because they are primal 
forces.

65
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,150
It's not surprising that you don't want 
to have anything to do with them,

66
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,750
that you stay away from situations where
they might make themselves manifest.

67
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:54,751
But the problem is by denying the worst 
in yourself in that manner of 

68
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,980
suppressing it,
you preclude the possibility of the best

69
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,430
because no one can be a good person 
without integrating their capacity for 

70
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,461
aggression.
Because without that capacity for 

71
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:08,780
aggression,
you cannot say no because no means if 

72
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,411
you really say it,
no means there isn't anything that you 

73
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:14,830
can do to me that will make me change my
mind or,

74
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,860
or conversely,
it means I will play for higher stakes 

75
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,131
than you will.
And unless you've got your aggression 

76
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:25,750
integrated,
there isn't a chance you can say that.

77
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:30,751
And if you did,
no one would take you seriously because 

78
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:30,751
they'd know it was just a show.

79
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:34,180
So one of the most useful things that 
you did,

80
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:37,630
I think was to work on this idea of the 
integration of the shadow because he was

81
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:39,460
really interested in the idea of evil,
right?

82
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:44,461
Especially working with trying to parcel
out what happened in Nazi Germany during

83
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:49,621
the Second World War.
What do you do with the part of you 

84
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:49,621
that's aggressive and potentially 
malevolent?

85
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:54,600
He just crush it.
That's the super ego response in some 

86
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,600
sense.
Do you just put it behind you,

87
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,270
so to speak?
Is that a possibility or do you admit to

88
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:00,640
its existence and bring it into the 
game?

89
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,420
And that's C for.
For Freud,

90
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:09,421
in some sense,
morality was super ego clamping down on 

91
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:10,360
the bed and there were fundamentally 
opposed.

92
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,170
Both human piaget had a different idea 
and I think they were right.

93
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:15,000
It's like,
no,

94
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:18,490
no,
you invite the bad guys out to play,

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,520
and so you're an aggressive hockey 
player,

96
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,810
but it's disciplined aggression that 
makes you,

97
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,410
gives you access to the whole sorts of 
energy you wouldn't otherwise have.

98
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,750
And then with regards to sexuality,
it's like,

99
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:35,080
well untrammeled promiscuity doesn't 
constitute a virtue,

100
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,550
but neither does unavoidable virginity.
Right.

101
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,700
In fact,
I think that's worse because it also 

102
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:44,980
masks itself with virtue.
It's like,

103
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:49,720
well you should be able to.
You should be able to do things that you

104
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:51,310
wouldn't do.
That's a,

105
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,330
that's like the definition of a 
genuinely moral person.

106
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,400
They could do it,
but they don't.

107
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,030
That's not cowardice.
And so that's,

108
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,900
you burn off the things that get in the 
way of that integration.

109
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:06,820
So

110
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,870
when you say dissolve and integrating,
yeah,

111
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,880
it'd be a good way to sort of bring the 
two ideas together that the burning off 

112
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,311
and the difficult processes necessary 
because the elements of yourself are 

113
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:22,600
structured together in a rigid way that 
is not working properly.

114
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,860
Yeah.
That's what happens to Japan in the 

115
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,541
belly of the whale.
He's so caught in his presuppositions 

116
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,340
that he can't escape.
Right.

117
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,350
And so Pinocchio represents the new 
forest.

118
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,770
So it's very interesting.
So when You Watch Pinocchio,

119
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:39,771
tried to rescue him.
The first thing Joe Petta does is 

120
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:40,440
Confuse Pinocchio with a fish because he
wants something to eat.

121
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,770
But Pinocchio is better than something 
to eat because he could rescue him so he

122
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:48,771
doesn't need to eat.
And then Pinocchio wants to make a fire 

123
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:50,100
engine pedo objects because he's going 
to burn up all the furniture.

124
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,520
So like we don't need the damn furniture
if we're getting out of the whale,

125
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,840
you know,
and so,

126
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,120
so Japan and he's old.
So that,

127
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,850
that's,
that's the,

128
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,200
that's the rigid structure.
That's the old gear that has to die off 

129
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,291
before the new year can be born.
It's a forest fire that allows for new 

130
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,810
growth and that's how those things are 
put together and to see.

131
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,580
And it's useful to know too because if 
you burn something off,

132
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,290
you might think,
well there's nothing left.

133
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,700
It's like,
that's not true.

134
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,030
If it's dead wood,
then you have room for new growth and 

135
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,650
you want to be doing that on a fairly 
regular basis.

136
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:22,560
That's the,
that's,

137
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,270
that's the snake that sheds its skin and
transforms itself.

138
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:26,840
Right?
That's,

139
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,920
that's the death and resurrection from a
psychological perspective,

140
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:35,921
it's exactly the same idea.
Now we don't know the upper limit to 

141
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:35,921
that,
right?

142
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:39,731
Because we don't know what a person 
would be like if they let everything 

143
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:42,880
that they could let go,
let go and only let in what was 

144
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,820
seemingly,
let's say,

145
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,280
but you can see that.
It's funny.

146
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,850
We don't know that to some degree you 
can see people very far.

147
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,240
You can see people start to do that 
without.

148
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,940
That's not an rare experience and people
improve very rapidly.

149
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,120
It can improve their lives very rapidly.
A lot of it's low hanging fruit,

150
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:08,650
like if you just stopped doing really 
stupid things that you know are stupid,

151
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:12,940
your life improves a lot so and it,
it frees you up.

152
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,180
It also means there's a,
there's an element there that's also 

153
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,761
associated with pride because people 
tend to take pride in who they are and 

154
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:25,691
that's a bad idea because that stops you
from becoming who you could be because 

155
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:30,971
if you're proud of who you are,
you won't let that go when it's 

156
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:31,130
necessary.
You won't step away from it,

157
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,600
you know,
and then you end up being your own 

158
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:36,600
parody.
Something like that.

159
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,470
That's also a very bad idea.
You want to be continually stepping away

160
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:42,060
from your previous self,
and so,

161
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,740
and I guess part of that too is that you
have to decide,

162
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:46,460
you know,
are you,

163
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:52,150
are you order or chaos or you the 
process that mediates between them and 

164
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,180
if you're the process that mediates 
between them,

165
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,450
you,
you are the thing transforms and that's 

166
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,420
the right attitude for human being 
because that's what we are.

167
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,100
We're the thing that voluntarily 
confronts chaos and transformed.

168
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,550
That's what we are.
And so for better or worse,

169
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,810
you know,
that's our deepest biological essence 

170
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,330
you might say.
And so you can let things go if you know

171
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:16,740
that there's more growth to come.

172
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,440
Yep.
