1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,150
Let's say you're socially anxious.
Okay,

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:05,520
so what happens when you're socially 
anxious?

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,300
You go to a party,
your heart's beating.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,640
Why?
The party is a monster.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,910
Why?
Because it's judging you and it's 

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,310
judging you.
It's putting you low down the dominance 

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,071
hierarchy because that's what a negative
judgment is and that interferes with 

8
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:25,080
your sexual soul success.
And that means that you're being harshly

9
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:27,690
evaluated by nature itself,
right?

10
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:32,691
So you are confronting the dragon of 
chaos when you go into the social 

11
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:33,660
situation.
And so what do you do?

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,230
You like this?
So you hunch over and that's low 

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:39,230
dominance.
I'm no threat.

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:39,230
It's like,
Whoa,

15
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,040
that's not going to get you very far,
you know,

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,030
but that's a logical thing to do in,
in the,

17
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,140
in the face of a tyrant.
So I'm no threat.

18
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,000
You know,
you look at the king and your dad,

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,220
I'm no threat,
I'm hunched over.

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,650
And then what's happening internally?
How are,

21
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,660
what are people thinking about me?
What are people thinking about me or am 

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:57,660
I looking stupid?
Am I looking foolish?

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,290
Geez,
I'm awkward.

24
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,220
I hate being here,
man.

25
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:02,250
I'm sweating too much.
It's all internalized,

26
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:04,430
right?
It's all self focused,

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,300
the,
the,

28
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,540
the,
I isn't work,

29
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,690
the eye isn't working.
What do you tell people?

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,380
Stop.
Don't stop thinking about yourself 

31
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,660
because you can't.
It's like,

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,150
don't think of a white elephant,
white elephant,

33
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:18,630
White,
elephant,

34
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:19,170
White,
elephant.

35
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,440
You can't tell someone to stop thinking 
about something because they get caught 

36
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,290
in the loop.
What you do with socially anxious people

37
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,870
as you say,
look at other people.

38
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,390
Look at them.
Right?

39
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,310
Why?
Because if you look at them,

40
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:34,590
you can tell what they're thinking and 
then you,

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,040
unless you're.
Unless you're terribly socialized and 

42
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,500
some people are,
some people have no social skills and so

43
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,800
the reason they can't go to a party is 
because they don't even know how to 

44
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:45,800
introduce themselves.

45
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,150
Like they're just no one ever taught 
them how to behave and so they're really

46
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:53,151
good candidates for behavior therapy 
because you walk them through the 

47
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:57,921
process of how you actually manifest the
procedures that are associated with 

48
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:01,320
social acceptability.
But most people aren't like that.

49
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,590
They have the ability.
So if they're really introverted in high

50
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:09,591
in neuroticism,
they can usually talk quite well to 

51
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:09,591
someone one on one.
Why?

52
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:11,730
Because they look at them all.
If I look at you,

53
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,940
it's another thing to do.
If you're ever speaking to a group of 

54
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,310
people,
never speak to the group of people there

55
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,380
that doesn't exist.
You talk to individuals and then they 

56
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,590
reflect for you the entire group because
they're all in trained.

57
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,900
You look at one person,
they broadcast to you what everyone's 

58
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,350
thinking and you know how to talk to one
person.

59
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,420
So it's easy.
So as soon as you focus on the person,

60
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,180
not you,
you push your attention outward.

61
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,330
Use Your I push your attention outward 
and you start watching.

62
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:47,331
Well then all your automatic mechanisms 
kick in and you start being awkward 

63
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:48,570
because if we're talking and I'm looking
here,

64
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,920
I don't know what you're going to do 
next and I'm going to put disjunctions 

65
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,210
into the like.
They're like a bad chords and the melody

66
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,130
of our,
of our conversation.

67
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,630
And the reason is I'm not paying 
attention.

68
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,750
So that's why the I is the thing at the 
top of the pyramid.

69
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,930
It's like the thing that enables you to 
win the set of all possible dominance 

70
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,280
hierarchies is the I pay attention.
Pay Attention.

71
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,580
That's the critical issue.
That's why the Egyptians worshiped 

72
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,671
horace.
That's why horace was the thing that 

73
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:20,671
rescued Osiris from the,
from the depths.

74
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:23,530
It's the capacity to pay attention.
What do you pay attention to?

75
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,510
Most?
What?

76
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:27,620
Your right hemisphere signals as 
anomalous.

77
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,060
It attracts your attention.
It's like this isn't going quite right.

78
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,580
I'm not looking at that wrong.
That's what you look at.

79
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,220
That's what you look at.
What's not going right,

80
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:40,300
because that's.
See,

81
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:42,280
that's the terrible monster that might 
eat you,

82
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,770
but it's also the place you get all the 
information,

83
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,460
so that's why it's useful to have 
discussions with your enemies because 

84
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,051
they will tell you things you do not 
know and that's such a great thing 

85
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:56,440
because if you don't know them well,
you're not very smart,

86
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:58,840
are you?
You know there may be a time when you go

87
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:03,841
somewhere,
that's the thing you need to know and 

88
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:03,970
maybe your enemy will kill you.
Why you're such a fool,

89
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,260
you know,
and a bunch of other things that aren't 

90
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,490
true to,
but even one thing that's accurate,

91
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:10,050
it's like,
yeah,

92
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,060
thanks very much man.
Maybe I'll do some work on that and I 

93
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,130
won't have to carry that forward.
So.

94
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:18,550
And then that's part of the reason again
why the terrible predator.

95
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,000
It's always the terrible Predator that 
has the gold.

96
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,890
It's like it's the person who delivers 
the message you do not want to hear.

97
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,110
So it's rough,
it's rough,

98
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,780
but it doesn't matter.
Life is rough.
