1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,270
So anyways,
Pinocchio doesn't know any better and 

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,761
he's got the egotism of youth and he's 
offered the easy way to success,

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:12,090
which is exactly what the Fox tells them
and off they go to see Stromboli.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,420
So this is the song,
I'm not going to read it all.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,980
It's great to be a celebrity and actor's
life for me.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,490
Um,
you sleep till after to you promenade a 

7
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:28,680
big cigar,
you tour the world in a private car,

8
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:31,350
you dine on chicken and caviar and 
actor's life for me.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,530
So it's all this idea of,
of wealth and public exposure and zero 

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,320
attention whatsoever to anything 
regarding responsibility or discipline 

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,460
or learning.
And so it's a dual attraction,

12
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,320
right?
You get everything we want and you don't

13
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:47,610
have to do anything.
Jesus.

14
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:52,611
What a deal.
And so that's what the act or 

15
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:52,611
represents.
It's,

16
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:52,630
it's a liar.
Fundamentally,

17
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:55,410
it's someone who's acting out a,
a deception there,

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,870
a persona in the union sense.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,200
So the persona is the mask you wear in 
public that you might even think you 

20
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:05,310
are,
but you're not.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,400
It's this mask and that's the,
that's the persona.

22
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:13,401
So the Fox and the cat,
or inviting the puppet to only become a 

23
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:17,430
persona and and that's,
that's see for you,

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,640
you start as a persona and then when you
start to investigate the parts of you 

25
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:26,010
that don't really fit in that persona,
that would be the shadow.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Then you start understanding who you 
really are and that's shocking because 

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,710
the persona contains everything roughly 
speaking that you think is good.

28
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:39,711
It may be even that your immediate 
culture thinks is good and then the 

29
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:42,951
shadow contains everything that's not 
part of that and some of that's really 

30
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:45,120
bad,
but some of it is good,

31
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,150
disguised as bad,
and you can't break out of the persona 

32
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,650
and transcended until you incorporate a 
lot of what's in the shadow.

33
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,650
And so for example,
if you're an extraordinarily 

34
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,841
compassionate person,
let's say 98th percentile will say 

35
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:04,160
you're going to be sacrificing yourself 
to other people all the time and there 

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,710
are people who will find that 
extraordinarily endearing and it will be

37
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:12,711
under some circumstances.
But the problem is is that you will 

38
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:13,800
sacrifice yourself and that's a really 
bad attitude to have.

39
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,810
For example,
towards adult males.

40
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,050
It's a great thing for infants,
but for adult males is the wrong 

41
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,171
approach,
and so you will get taken advantage of 

42
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:26,910
continually by people who are looking 
for someone like you until you grow some

43
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:29,290
teeth and you'll think,
no,

44
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,740
no.
That's the opposite of compassion.

45
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,920
Being able to bite hard is the opposite 
of compassion,

46
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,220
which it is,
and so you'll have that pushed into the 

47
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,560
predatory category.
I'm not doing that.

48
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,570
I'm not getting angry.
I don't like conflict.

49
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,900
It's like until you bring that out of 
the depths and put it on so you can use 

50
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,130
it,
you're going to be in trouble and that's

51
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:55,131
kind of niches,
idea of the reevaluation of good and 

52
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:55,131
evil,
right?

53
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:58,911
You have a sense of what's good in a 
sense of what isn't with your 

54
00:02:58,911 --> 00:02:58,911
conscience,
but it's not very smart.

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,080
It's got things in the wrong boxes and a
lot of the things that even nature 

56
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,831
itself,
a lot of the things that you accept as 

57
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:10,000
untrammeled goods like compassion,
let's say have a very dark side,

58
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:15,001
first of all,
and second are not enough to get you 

59
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:18,061
through life.
You need the opposite virtues to and so 

60
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:21,481
you have to develop them and so you get 
outside the persona to do that,

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,120
but anyways,
Pinocchio was invited to be a false 

62
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,661
persona,
to take the gains of celebrity without 

63
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:30,850
having to do anything to be educated.

64
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,030
He's just gonna go right to the top from
right where he is and you know people 

65
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,931
are kind of fascinated by that idea.
That's why you watch America's got 

66
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:42,520
talent or the x factor which your shows 
I actually love.

67
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,420
By the way you,
you.

68
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,350
You never see narcissism in its pure 
forms.

69
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,710
Then you see it when you watch people 
who display an absolute lack of talent 

70
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,630
and become homicidal.
When someone dares pointed out,

71
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,240
right,
accusatory and homicidal,

72
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,310
instantly it's,
it's really something,

73
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,140
and then now and then you do see one of 
these people who's so introverted and so

74
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,250
out of society and have this 
unbelievable gift,

75
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:14,251
which is also something really 
remarkable to see and it's no wonder 

76
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:17,701
those things are so popular.
They're psychologically extraordinarily 

77
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:17,980
interesting.
