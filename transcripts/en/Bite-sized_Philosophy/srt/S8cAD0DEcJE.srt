1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,490
One of the things you said about the 
shadow,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,270
and this is I would say one of the 
primary impediments to enlightenment is 

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,250
that if you start looking at your 
motives for,

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,890
for misbehaving,
and,

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,760
and I mean by that,
something very specific.

6
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:19,761
I mean,
I don't mean that you're misbehaving by 

7
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:19,761
someone else's standards.
I don't mean that.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,070
I mean when you know by your own 
standards that you're doing something 

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,010
that's devious or malevolent or 
underhanded,

10
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:31,011
you know it and you still do it.
So it's your own judgment you're 

11
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:34,320
bringing to bear on yourself.
If you look at why you're doing that,

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,890
the longer you look at it,
the deeper a hole you dig.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,120
And so this is the Motif of Dante's 
inferno fundamentally.

14
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:46,390
So Dante's inferno is a story about,
um,

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,340
I can't remember his name unfortunately,
might be Dante,

16
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,900
in fact,
although I don't remember.

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,240
He's led into hell by Virgil,
who's an,

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,990
who's an ancient,
who is an ancient philosopher,

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,730
thinker and hell has levels.
And so the outer level is,

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,740
and this is a Christianized version of 
hell because there's hills of all sorts,

21
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,570
but this is a christianized virgin 
version.

22
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:12,390
And so the on the outermost levels of 
hell,

23
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:16,230
which is sort of like normal life,
are the ancient philosophers,

24
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:18,900
so they're still in hell because they 
weren't Christian,

25
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:23,901
but it's kind of like,
it's like cheap motel hell instead of 

26
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:25,290
the full pip thing,
you know?

27
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,890
And so then Dante goes deeper and deeper
into hell until he gets right to the 

28
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,870
bottom of it.
It's been a while since I read it,

29
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:38,871
but if I remember correctly,
Satan himself is encased in ice at the 

30
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:40,770
bottom of hell,
surrounded by people who betray others.

31
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,190
And so Dante,
his notion was that the worst of all 

32
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,011
possible violations of moral behavior 
was be trail and that they're in the 

33
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:50,790
deepest levels of hell.

34
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,940
And I really liked that idea.
I think it's true because if you trust 

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,751
me,
then you're manifesting the necessary 

36
00:01:59,751 --> 00:01:59,751
courage that put someone through life.
You know,

37
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:02,160
if you're smart,
you don't trust because you're naive.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,270
You Trust me knowing that I've full of 
snakes and so are you.

39
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:10,200
But maybe we could cooperate and move 
things along nicely.

40
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,950
We know and we could reduce each other 
to the word to our word.

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,230
And we could cooperate,
but you're awake,

42
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,850
you know,
and then I'd be trey that then I'm 

43
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,591
undermining your necessary faith in life
and humanity and you can really hurt 

44
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,980
someone that way.
Like sometimes it's self be trail,

45
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,610
but you can really do someone in that.
We can really traumatize them,

46
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,670
they can so that they can't recover.
And so it's a really terrible thing to 

47
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,361
do to someone and maybe it's the worst 
thing and that was don taste idea and 

48
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:41,361
it's tied in.

49
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,880
That makes very interesting reading.
If you read it at the same time as 

50
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,780
Milton's paradise lost because those are
metaphysical explorations.

51
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,260
This is what they are.
They're metaphysical explorations of the

52
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:57,261
terrible places you can end up and that 
people do end up and also a metaphysical

53
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:00,700
explanation of what spirit takes you 
there.

54
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,480
So because you might ask,
well why'd you betray someone?

55
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,850
And that is a deep question and so 
you'll have your specific reasons.

56
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:11,560
But under that there'll be some other 
reasons.

57
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,240
And under that there'll be some other 
reasons.

58
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:15,100
And under that there'll be some other 
reasons.

59
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,490
And if you go all the way to the bottom,
you come up with the ultimate reasons 

60
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,190
why you'd be trade someone and when you 
look at that,

61
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,300
that will not be pretty.
That's when your proclivity for evil,

62
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:30,301
let's say you nights with the general 
human proclivity for evil and you 

63
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,230
discover just exactly what you're 
capable of.

64
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,830
And so humans notion was that,
well that was a full encounter with the 

65
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,491
shadow,
which is I suppose partly what this 

66
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:43,411
course is about because one of the 
things that I believe I told you at the 

67
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:47,251
beginning was that I was going to try to
help you understand how it might be that

68
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:52,651
you could be an Auschwitz guard and to 
really understand that that's a 

69
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:54,970
horrifying thing to understand.
But I'll tell you,

70
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,810
if you want to grow some teeth,
that's a really good thing to 

71
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,201
understand.
So we were talking about your capacity 

72
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,040
to negotiate before,
like if you aren't a monster,

73
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,670
you cannot negotiate.
But if you,

74
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,880
if you've got that under control,
then you don't have to be a monster.

75
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,160
It's really paradoxical.
So if you're just naive,

76
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,220
well you end up in jail.
And marionette master has control over 

77
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:24,790
you.
That's not helpful.

78
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:30,210
So that's not good.
That just means you're useless and you 

79
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,061
can be manipulated,
won't go out of your way to be 

80
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:35,251
malevolent.
But it's mostly because you just don't 

81
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:35,251
have the skills or the organizational 
skills or,

82
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,470
or even the depth to do that.
You know you're good because you're 

83
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,080
harmless.
That's not good.

84
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,440
That's easily manipulated.
And so you think,

85
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:45,790
well how do you get out of that?
Well,

86
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:50,791
partly you watch people that because you
know what they're like because you know 

87
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,901
what you're like and that,
but you also know what you could do and 

88
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:59,041
would do if you were pushed.
And so you don't have to show much of 

89
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,281
that when you're negotiating with 
someone for them to take you really 

90
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,090
seriously.
So it's a strange thing,

91
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:09,091
you know,
but one of the things you pointed out 

92
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:11,071
too was that what you most need to know 
will be found where you least want to 

93
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:15,961
look.
And that's because you haven't already 

94
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:15,961
looked there.
And so it's a little different for every

95
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:16,720
everyone,
right?

96
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:21,721
Because your particular place you'd want
to look isn't going to be the same as 

97
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,871
your place,
but you're going to have a place you 

98
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:24,910
don't want to look and what you haven't 
discovered.

99
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:29,911
That's where it is,
and so that's partly going to be 

100
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:31,210
discovered by you looking at what you're
capable of,

101
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:32,410
what you're truly capable of.
