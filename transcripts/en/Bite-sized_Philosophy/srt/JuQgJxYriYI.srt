1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So the question is,
how do you differentiate the utility of 

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,540
behavioral slash psychotherapeutic 
treatments for conditions like 

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,540
depression versus medical treatments?
Okay,

4
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:14,541
so the first thing I would say is don't 
underestimate the utility of medical 

5
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:17,460
interventions.
Depression is a catastrophe.

6
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:22,461
It carries with it a very high suicide 
rate and it also levels people out and 

7
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:27,381
it's really hard on their families and 
so and it and it's physiologically 

8
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:31,791
extraordinarily damaging.
And so if you're in a depressive state 

9
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:34,830
and it's severe,
you can try an antidepressant.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,890
You'll know in a month if it works,
if it works well,

11
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:39,450
maybe it'll help you get your life 
together.

12
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:41,580
Like we could say,
well maybe you're depressed because your

13
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:44,100
life isn't very well together.
Could be.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,890
Sometimes people are depressed,
their life is just,

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,260
it isn't fine because no one's life is 
fine.

16
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:54,261
Everyone's life is a tragedy.
But sometimes people have their lives in

17
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:59,271
order,
as much as you could expect anyone to 

18
00:00:59,271 --> 00:00:59,271
have.

19
00:00:59,271 --> 00:00:59,271
They have friends,
they have an intimate relationship,

20
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:01,050
they have a career that they like,
you know,

21
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,080
they're,
they're qualified industrious people 

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,080
working hard on what they're doing.
And,

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,050
and,
and really playing a minimum number of 

24
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:11,190
games with themselves and they're 
terribly depressed,

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,000
antidepressant man that sometimes that 
will just fix it.

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,090
And so hooray,
you were biological entity.

27
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:23,091
If,
if there's something out there that can 

28
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:23,820
help you strengthen yourself so that you
can prevail.

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,590
Great.
And you know,

30
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:26,850
people,
you hear,

31
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,830
everyone takes antidepressants,
you know,

32
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,890
everyone's taking them.
It's like no one takes those bloody 

33
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,111
things without serious consideration.
Half the time I spend with my clients 

34
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:40,431
who are depressed is often the two years
long attempt to get them to tentatively 

35
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:45,111
try an antidepressant because there are 
so guilty that they're relying on an 

36
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:47,190
external crutch to sort out their lives 
that they can't even tolerate it.

37
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,720
But you know,
I say,

38
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:51,510
well look man,
what if you had diabetes,

39
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,710
you know are going to take your insulin.
It's like you got stressed,

40
00:01:55,711 --> 00:02:00,711
you blew out at your weakest point.
That's what happens when you get 

41
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:03,231
stressed.
If there's something out there that 

42
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:03,231
might help you,
it's like try it for God's sake.

43
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:06,750
You'll know in a month and you'd just 
stop if it doesn't work.

44
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,730
Now,
having said that,

45
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,400
you want to do a multidimensional 
analysis,

46
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,000
it's like,
well,

47
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:15,150
do you have any friends?
Do you have an intimate relationship?

48
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,370
Are you pursuing one?
Do you have a reasonable career?

49
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,290
Are you as educated as you are?
Intelligent?

50
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,290
You have something useful to do with 
your time outside of work?

51
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Do you have a drug or alcohol problem?
Are there other behavioral issues like 

52
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,670
sleep dysregulation and lack of eating 
that are contributing to the pathology?

53
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,880
You want to differentiate all of that 
and wherever you can make a behavioral 

54
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,360
intervention so much the better,
but sometimes too,

55
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:41,361
you're dealing with people whose lives 
are so that they don't even know where 

56
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:41,361
to start.

57
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,140
They're different than the ones who have
everything in order.

58
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,170
See,
and you say,

59
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:44,670
well,
try this man.

60
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:47,640
Maybe you won't cut your throat in the 
next month because if your dad,

61
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:50,400
it's going to be hard to work with you,
and so,

62
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,600
so medical interventions,
anything.

63
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,140
If you're sick,
you do what's necessary to get better 

64
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,670
and you your pride behind.
If you.

65
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,700
If you have to,
and that says nothing about the utility 

66
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,141
of the behavioral interventions,
you want to hit the problem with 

67
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:12,961
everything you have at your disposal,
but some antidepressants especially,

68
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,350
especially for people whose lives are 
together and who are depressed,

69
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:19,630
antidepressants can be absolutely 
miraculous.

70
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,350
So you know when you hear about the 
clinical evidence in their favor being 

71
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,090
iffy,
and that's partly because the diagnosis 

72
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:30,090
of depression isn't very well 
formulated,

73
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,300
that it's very different to have a 
terrible life than to be depressed and 

74
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,580
antidepressants can only help you so 
much if you have a terrible life.

75
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,760
So yeah.
