1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,630
That's why a dragon hordes gold.
It's like,

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,060
what's up with that?
Well,

3
00:00:05,061 --> 00:00:09,290
it'll eat you and it will,
but it has gold.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,270
Well,
so what do you do about that?

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,590
Because it's,
it's,

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,170
it's paradoxical demands.
Well,

7
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:18,220
what you want to do is face the dragon 
and get the damn gold.

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,450
That's what you want to do.
Well,

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,660
you have to be a paradoxical being even 
to do that.

10
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:25,510
So,
you know,

11
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:26,400
in,
in the Hobbit,

12
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,650
for example,
when,

13
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,420
what's his name,
Frodo,

14
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,140
right?
Isn't,

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,190
it's not Bilbo Bilbo in the Harvard,
you know,

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,450
he's kind of this little underdeveloped

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,240
overprotected shire dweller and he's 
called on a great adventure to go and 

18
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:49,931
find the dragon and he has to become a 
thief in order to manage it.

19
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,640
Well,
that's pretty weird,

20
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,540
you know,
it's like,

21
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,050
well,
it's because as a good citizen,

22
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:59,630
he's just not enough to conquer a 
dragon.

23
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,930
He asked to also become a bad citizen in
some sense.

24
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:06,320
He has to incorporate the part of 
themselves that's monstrous,

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,050
let's say,
and develop that and hone it.

26
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,360
And that's to say that,
well,

27
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:13,460
if you're harmless,
you're not virtuous,

28
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,120
you're just harmless.
You're like a rabbit.

29
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,810
Rabbit isn't virtuous.
It's just just can't do anything except 

30
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,530
get eaten.
It's not virtuous.

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,880
If you're a monster and you don't act 
monstrously,

32
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,450
then you're virtuous,
but you also have to be a monster while 

33
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:34,670
you see this all the time.
Harry Potter's like that too.

34
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,320
It's like he's.
He's flawed,

35
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:37,760
he's hurt,
he's got evil in him.

36
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:39,140
He can talk to snakes.
Man.

37
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,470
He breaks rules all the time,
all the time.

38
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,120
He's not an obedient at all,
but you know,

39
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,140
he has a good reason for breaking the 
rules and if he couldn't break the 

40
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,801
rules,
him and his little clique of rule 

41
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:54,560
breaking troublemakers.
If they didn't break the rules,

42
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,030
they wouldn't attain the highest goal.
So it's very peculiar,

43
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,110
but it's very,
very.

44
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:01,070
It's a very,
very,

45
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:04,190
very,
very common mythological notion.

46
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,080
You know,
the hero has to be,

47
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,220
the hero has to be a monster,
but a controlled monster.

48
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:13,870
Batman is like that.
You know what I mean?

49
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:14,650
It's,
it's everywhere.

50
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:19,651
It's the tour story.
You always hear meaning.

51
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,010
We have to be more precise.

52
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,620
Well,
that's good.

53
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,470
That's a good question because one 
question is,

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,080
you know,
you're kind of implicitly moral insofar 

55
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,110
as you're socialized,
but that's sort of procedural.

56
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:41,150
It's just built into you.
This is different.

57
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:46,151
This is also becoming conscious of it 
and expanding out your personality into 

58
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:47,390
dimensions that it wouldn't normally 
occupy.

59
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:49,820
So did.
This happens to people all the time.

60
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,940
So for example,
lots of my clients,

61
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:57,941
my clinical clients are too agreeable 
and they're generally women because 

62
00:02:57,941 --> 00:03:02,351
women are more agreeable than men,
but always because I've had agreeable 

63
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:05,731
man,
his clients as well and what happens is 

64
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:08,080
they,
they're resentful and they don't know 

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,171
how to stand up for themselves and it's 
because they're very compassionate by 

66
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:12,100
nature and so if you're entering into a 
negotiation with them,

67
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,050
they'll let you win.
Well,

68
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:16,390
that's not so good because you know you 
need to win too.

69
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,530
Especially if you're in an organization 
of adults where there's.

70
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,990
There's a struggle,
right?

71
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,240
When you have kids,
you can let them win.

72
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,660
Especially infants you like.
You have to let them win and that's 

73
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,530
partly why compassion is so necessary,
but as a,

74
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,340
as a basis for negotiation between 
adults,

75
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,750
it's like,
sorry,

76
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,520
it's insufficient.
You have to.

77
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,110
You have to be a bit of a monster so 
that you can say no and so a lot of what

78
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:48,220
you do in psychotherapy is treat 
people's anxiety and depression.

79
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:53,221
That's a huge chunk of it.
Help them straighten out the way they 

80
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:53,221
think.
That's a huge chunk of it,

81
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:54,520
but another chunk of it is,
well,

82
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:55,960
let's toughen you up.
You know,

83
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:57,880
let's put you in a position where you 
can bargain.

84
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:02,881
Let's teach you how to assert yourself 
and stand up for yourself and that's 

85
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:05,710
assertiveness training and it's a huge 
chunk of psychotherapy and you need to.

86
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,770
You need to learn it.
It's like because part of how you 

87
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,451
regulate your interactions with other 
people is to negotiate and you cannot 

88
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:18,490
negotiate unless you can say no,
you can't do it,

89
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,090
and its causes conflict to say no,
and if you don't like conflict,

90
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,400
which is basically the definition of 
being agreeable,

91
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,580
then you can't tolerate the conflict and
so then you can't negotiate on your own 

92
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,061
behalf and so then you keep losing and 
you're bullied and you know it's not 

93
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:34,270
good.
Then you get resentful and,

94
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,300
and it's really not good.
So you have to develop your inner 

95
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,390
monster a little bit and,
and then that makes you a better person,

96
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,250
not a worst person.
It's weird.

97
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,950
It's weird,
but,

98
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,540
but that's just how it is.
