1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,270
There are women are very good in high 
school.

2
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:04,770
Then they go to college.
They're very good.

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,570
In College,
they had nailed her damn grades.

4
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:11,571
They do their studying,
they get their a's and they end the ace 

5
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:12,180
Al Sat,
so they're smart too.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,580
Then they go off to do their articling 
and they're really,

7
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:19,581
really good at it and then they get 
offered an associate position and 

8
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:22,881
they're really,
really good at it and then by the time 

9
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:24,681
they're 30,
they make partner and let's say they're 

10
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:24,681
in high pressure,
high paying jobs,

11
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:26,280
$250,000
a year.

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,540
$300,000
a year.

13
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,400
$500 an hour.
Okay.

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,720
What's your life like?
You work all the time,

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,360
period.
Seventy hours a week,

16
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:38,730
75 hours a week,
flat out,

17
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,650
and you don't get to make any mistakes 
and if your client calls you at three in

18
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:45,570
the morning on Monday,
on Sunday you say,

19
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:48,750
I'm really glad to hear you hear from 
you because if you don't,

20
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:53,751
there's some hot law firm in New York 
that'll take your client from you at a 

21
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:56,250
moment's notice and the client is paying
you whatever the firm,

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,400
$750 an hour of which maybe you get 3:50
and what they want is an answer about 

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,850
something really complicated right?

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,850
Bloody now,
and you can say all you want about the 

25
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,121
fact that women have a difficult time 
with that because it's a male dominant 

26
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:14,841
patriarchy.
Any any female lawyer who's hit 30 and 

27
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,560
his partner that has any sense at all 
knows that complete bloody rubbish.

28
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,600
It's market determined right to the 
core.

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,480
What happens to the women when they're 
in their thirties?

30
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,590
They all leave the high end law firms.
Why?

31
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,640
Because who in their right mind would 
want to live like that?

32
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,230
That's the issue,
right?

33
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,920
Once you make about $60,000
a year for your family,

34
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:39,921
but let's say for you personally,
additional income makes zero has zero 

35
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:42,360
impact on your quality of life,
zero,

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,870
so why work 80 hours a week while men 
will do it?

37
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,640
Some men,
very few,

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,060
a handful of hyper competitive men who 
are obsessed with hitting the pinnacle 

39
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,700
of the given dominance hierarchy there 
in will happily work 80 hours a week and

40
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,440
they'll forgo everything else.

41
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,940
Relationships,
family,

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
children way in the second category,
and so those men are often very 

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,650
difficult to live with too because 
they're so obsessed with their career.

44
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,650
It's hard to have a relationship with 
them and maybe they don't have much of a

45
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:15,651
relationship with their kids,
but they're damn good at what they do 

46
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:18,651
and part of that is they're smart and 
disciplined and they'll work nonstop all

47
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:23,931
the time.
It's like an obsession and that's the 

48
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:26,601
sort of people who run things.
Those are the people who run things 

49
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:30,590
while they're often also disagreeable to
because you want to wrote a manage 

50
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:30,590
people.
Really,

51
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,090
they're not going to like you.
You know when it's not an easy thing to 

52
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,211
not be liked,
and actually if you're an agreeable 

53
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:38,211
person and women are more agreeable than
men,

54
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:42,500
it's quite painful to be disliked,
but if you're in a managerial and 

55
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,890
executive position,
the probability that people are going to

56
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:45,180
like you is quite low.

57
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,980
Now,
if you're a real son of a bitch,

58
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:48,970
then they're going to dislike you more,
but it's.

59
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:51,750
It's those.
Those positions are very stressful,

60
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:55,560
partly because of the interpersonal 
dynamics and they're also incredibly,

61
00:02:55,561 --> 00:03:00,561
incredibly competitive,
so the women hit that at and they're 

62
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:04,651
completely qualified in the law.
Firms are bloody desperate to keep them 

63
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,980
because it's really hard to find highly 
qualified people,

64
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,320
especially once you've put all that time
into training them,

65
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,780
especially if they're also good at 
bringing in business.

66
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,480
The law firms trip over themselves to 
try to keep them.

67
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,190
They can't.
The women think,

68
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,650
why in the world am I doing this?
Why?

69
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,530
When the world would anyone in their 
right mind do this?

70
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,440
Especially because they're often married
by that point too,

71
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,620
and generally they've married a husband 
who makes as much money or more than 

72
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,370
them so they don't need the damn money,
and so they think,

73
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,140
well,
there's more to life than this,

74
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,150
which is exactly the right thing to 
think,

75
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:39,270
and so they go and find a job that's 
nine to five and controllable so that 

76
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,710
they can hire a nanny and have some kids
and have a life,

77
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:42,880
and it's like,
yes,

78
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,740
that's the intelligent thing to do.

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,860
So we've got things backwards in our 
culture.

80
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,040
We're thinking at least in part,
why aren't there more women in positions

81
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,110
of power?
Wrong question.

82
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,860
The right question is why are there any 
minute all who want those positions of 

83
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,721
power?
Because it's not just positions of 

84
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,521
power.
You have to be such a knothead to think 

85
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:05,521
that,
oh,

86
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:05,521
it's a position of power.
It's like,

87
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:10,410
sure,
but it's a position of overwhelming 

88
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,590
responsibility and if you make mistakes,
you're done.

89
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,250
Right?
It's not like you occupy that position 

90
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:17,350
of power and everyone does what they're 
told all the time in your life is easy.

91
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:18,550
It's like,
forget about that.

92
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,690
People are on your case to do exactly 
the right thing all the time,

93
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:25,780
100 percent of the time and maybe you 
want that.

94
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:30,781
Maybe you don't.
So the what I don't know what people 

95
00:04:30,781 --> 00:04:33,421
think is these people are all sitting in
their offices with their feet up on the 

96
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:34,390
desk,
smoking cigars and pressing the world.

97
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,580
It's like that isn't how it works.
Those people,

98
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:41,581
they work flat out all the time,
so and it's fine if that's what you want

99
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:45,010
and some people are like that.
They're hyper industrious people,

100
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:46,420
right?
From a trade perspective,

101
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,930
no matter where you put them,
if you put them in a forest with an axe,

102
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:52,630
they just wander around,
chopping down trees nonstop,

103
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,610
right?
Because there it's built into them.

104
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,020
But if you want to have a balanced life 
and you should want that,

105
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,670
you know,
because the other thing you'll find,

106
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,140
this is God's Gospel.
Truth is that the older you get,

107
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:07,870
if you have any sense at all,
the more important your family is to you

108
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,860
like that.
The,

109
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,920
the utility of your career.
Maybe that peaks around 35 or 40 and it 

110
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,330
starts to decline pretty rapidly after 
that,

111
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:21,331
and what happens if you're fortunate,
you have someone in your life that you 

112
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:22,270
love,
that you've woven yourself together with

113
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:27,271
and you have some kids so that you have 
something to do from the time you're 50 

114
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:29,380
till the time you're 80,
and so it's a real mistake.

115
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,510
It's a barren future without children,
man,

116
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:36,340
I can tell you that it's a real mistake 
and so we do a terrible job of say,

117
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:38,260
putting that image forward and saying,
well,

118
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:39,970
yeah,
now you know,

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
because women have access to the birth 
control pill now and can compete in the 

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,330
same domains as men.
Roughly speaking,

121
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,480
there is a real practical problem here.
It's partly an economic problem now 

122
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,741
because when I was roughly your age,
it was still possible for a one income 

123
00:05:55,741 --> 00:06:00,031
family do exist.
While you know that wages have been flat

124
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,000
except in the upper one percent since 
1973.

125
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,500
Why?
Well,

126
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:11,501
it's easy.
What happens when you double the labor 

127
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:11,501
force?
What happens?

128
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:16,210
You have the value of labor,
so now we're in a situation where it 

129
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,030
takes two people to make as much as one 
did before.

130
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,240
So we went from a situation where 
women's career opportunities were 

131
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,991
relatively limited to where they were 
relatively unlimited and there were two 

132
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:30,251
incomes to wear and so women could work 
to a situation where women have to work 

133
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,510
and they only make half as much as they 
would have otherwise and now we're going

134
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:35,660
to go into a situation.

135
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,810
This is the next step.
Whereas women will work because men 

136
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,170
won't.
And that's what's coming now.

137
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,200
So we.
There was an economics economist 

138
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,451
articles showing that 50 percent now of 
of boys in school or having trouble with

139
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:52,730
their basic subjects and you look around
you and universities,

140
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:55,430
you can see this happening and I've 
watched it over decades.

141
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,210
I would say 90 percent of the people in 
my personality class are now women.

142
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,540
There won't be a damn man left and 
university in 10 years except in the 

143
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,141
stem fields and it's a complete bloody 
catastrophe and it's a catastrophe for 

144
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,760
women because I don't know where the 
hell you're going to find someone to,

145
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,730
to have,
uh,

146
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,640
you know,
to marry and have a family with.

147
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,710
If this keeps happening.
So.

148
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,010
And you think when you're 19 because 
you're so clueless when you're 19,

149
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:20,150
you don't know a bloody thing.

150
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:20,840
You think,
well,

151
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,470
I'm not really sure I want children 
anyway.

152
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:23,360
So it's like,
oh yeah,

153
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,130
you can tell how well you've been 
educated.

154
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,110
Jesus,
dismal,

155
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,520
dismal without fail.
I got to tell you,

156
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:36,521
without fail,
I've watched women go through their 

157
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:36,521
professional careers.
Many,

158
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:38,570
many of them.
It's a very rare woman who at the age of

159
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,550
30,
he doesn't consider having a child.

160
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:44,720
Her primary desire and the ones that 
don't consider that.

161
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:47,990
Generally in my observation,
there's something that isn't quite right

162
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,630
in the way that they're constituted,
are looking at the world.

163
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,150
Sometimes you get women who are truly 
non maternal.

164
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:54,320
You know,
by temperament there.

165
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,660
They have a masculine tempera 
disagreeable.

166
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,730
They're not,
they're not particularly compassionate,

167
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,620
they're not maternal,
they don't really.

168
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:02,510
They're not that interested in kids.
Fair enough,

169
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:07,511
man,
but there aren't that many of them and 

170
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:09,221
there's plenty who will not admit to 
themselves that that's what they most 

171
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:10,100
desperately want.

172
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,440
Do you think women would be better off 
or their favorite?

173
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:15,670
Thirty.

174
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,470
Who knows?
Like it's like it really is a problem 

175
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,950
now.
It's a really tough one.

176
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:26,170
I don't think anybody knows the answer 
to that because

177
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,150
35 new kids are saying 10:11.
Then you can go and get a bachelor's and

178
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,650
masters easy that way.
Having the career first and then trying 

179
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,620
to raise young kids.

180
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,010
Yeah,
I,

181
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,020
I,
I can't answer that because I've seen 

182
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,830
women do a good job of it both both ways
and you do get the odd woman who manages

183
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,820
a high powered career and kids,
but Jesus,

184
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,800
those women,
man,

185
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,660
like they,
they,

186
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,240
they buy more powerful microwaves 
because take 45 seconds to cook the food

187
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,850
instead of a minute and I'm not kidding.
It's like they're,

188
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,280
they're up at five.
They exercise for half an hour.

189
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:04,620
They make breakfast,
they get their kids ready to work,

190
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:07,920
they go to work,
they worked 14 hours a 14 hour days flat

191
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:12,921
bloody out.
They come home and work for another two 

192
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:14,931
hours to get their kids organized.
They have a nanny to help them out and 

193
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:18,850
then they work for two more hours before
they go to bed at like one and then 

194
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,170
they're up at five and they do that 
again and I'll tell you,

195
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:24,171
you better be tough if you're going to 
do that physically too because you'll 

196
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:24,270
just burn yourself to a crisp.

197
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,190
I've seen some women manage it,
you know,

198
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,370
but they're like,
they're tough and they're rare because 

199
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,260
that's a hell of a hell of a regimen.
And then if anything goes wrong,

200
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:39,261
you know,
you have a sick kid or something like 

201
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:40,821
that,
or there's any sort of crisis in your 

202
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:40,821
family.
It's just,

203
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:40,821
you know,
it's,

204
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,520
then it becomes too much.
And I don't know the answer to that,

205
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:45,090
you know,
I mean,

206
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:50,091
the advantage women have is they live 
about eight years longer than men 

207
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,460
because testosterone kills men.
So Limited.

208
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,210
Well that,
that,

209
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,150
that's right.
They pay up front and gain on the,

210
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,140
on the,
on,

211
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,200
in the long run,
but how it isn't clear how our society 

212
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,690
should sort this out.
We don't know.

213
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:08,691
And it's partly we don't know what to do
now that women have control over their 

214
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:08,880
reproductive function.
It's a big mystery.

215
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,270
Yep.

216
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,840
But I think later on competition and 
that's always a conference.

217
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,630
People are always hiring talent because 
there's.

218
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,920
Yup.
Yes.

219
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:33,600
Well,
and the thing is young,

220
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:35,880
stupid people have the advantage of 
being young,

221
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:41,810
middle aged,
stupid people have the disadvantage of 

222
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,151
being middle aged.
And so if you're going to hire a young 

223
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:44,151
stupid person or a middle aged stupid 
person,

224
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:45,480
you'll go for the young,
stupid person.

225
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,890
And I'm stupid.
I mean,

226
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:47,480
you know,
no,

227
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,090
I'm being sarcastic obviously,
but I mean without,

228
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,670
without experience and just getting 
started in the world,

229
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,700
you're much more likely to favor someone
young because there's an instant 

230
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,170
explanation for their relative 
cluelessness and it's a problem,

231
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,640
you know,
so.

232
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,760
So I don't know what the answer is,
but one,

233
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,340
one answer certainly is,
at least in part,

234
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:13,341
is to start letting young women know 
what being 30 and being female is like 

235
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,740
because and also to disabuse them of the
notion that there's something magical 

236
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:18,780
about a career.
First of all,

237
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:20,350
most people don't have careers,
man,

238
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,550
they have jobs and the reason you get 
paid for a job is because you're being 

239
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,120
asked to do things you wouldn't do 
unless you were being paid.

240
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,480
And so it's not.
It's not some not some utopia of cigar 

241
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,170
smoking with your boots up on your desk,
that's for sure.

242
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,190
Not,
not that that would be such a utopia to 

243
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,190
begin with.
