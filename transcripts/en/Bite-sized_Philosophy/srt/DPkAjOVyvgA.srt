1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,400
This is an image of,
of,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,610
I would call it the patriarchy and it's 
a lovely image.

3
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:09,820
It's God the father,
and he's assimilated to the sun because,

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:15,450
well,
because consciousness which is 

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,121
associated with light is the builder of 
culture and he rules over the walled 

6
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:22,921
city and so he's the centering idea.
You might say that that unites a 

7
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:23,890
culture.
That's another way of looking at it.

8
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:28,891
And he's got two hands.
I described the miss security and 

9
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:31,360
tyranny altogether order and you know,
if you're in a university,

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,550
the u of t students complain about this 
all the time.

11
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:35,430
There's 60,000
university students,

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,820
right?
They feel like numbers,

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,930
they feel ignored and no wonder because 
their numbers and they are ignored.

14
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:42,640
It's no wonder they didn't feel that 
way.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,410
You know,
and there's huge classes of 1200 people 

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:48,410
and they get lost and they think,
God,

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,630
that's a pretty evil structure.

18
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,830
And,
and uncaring.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,670
It's like,
yeah,

20
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:53,980
that's exactly right.
But by the same token,

21
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,310
you know,
you get to purchase four years of 

22
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,111
intellectual freedom and you have all 
these people who could at least in 

23
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:04,351
principle,
teach you something and you get an 

24
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:06,391
identity out of the deal and you have 
half a half a bit of sense here in the 

25
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:10,351
library trying to read great things and 
maybe you're not quite as dopey and 

26
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:13,561
useless when you come out as you were 
when you went in and so it takes with 

27
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:17,371
one hand and gives with the other,
and you've got to understand that about 

28
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:18,100
your position in relationship to 
society.

29
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,740
It crushes you and molds you at the same
time.

30
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,880
It limits you and furthers your compute 
capability at the same time,

31
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,030
and it's up to you to determine how to 
establish a harmonious and productive 

32
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,470
relationship with that because that's 
one of the fundamental demands of life.

33
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,160
Now it sort of splits into these two 
things.

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,880
That's the king who devours his son.
I love that picture and that's,

35
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:50,330
well,
that's a society that's become 

36
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:50,330
tyrannical,
right?

37
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:50,700
I'm the son of the king is the thing 
that regenerates the king,

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,960
the kings old and he's blind and he's 
stupid and he's corrupt and he has a son

39
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,810
and the son is lively and awake and 
alert and can see,

40
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,080
and if the father's not pathological,
then he tries to make the sun strong so 

41
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,240
that the son can grow up and revitalize 
the culture and if he's a tyrant,

42
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:09,990
well then he devours him and then he 
gets old and corrupt and everything goes

43
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,050
into chaos.
And then there's the benevolent king 

44
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,040
who's got that properly balanced and you
see in this picture he's got a globe but

45
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:24,041
his hand with the cross on top of it,
and that's means the same thing that 

46
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:27,780
that other symbolic image did,
which is that the proper society 

47
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,821
supports the suffering individual in his
or her attempts to transcend their 

48
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:34,710
suffering and attain a proper ethical 
perspective.

49
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,350
And then the son of the father is the 
hero.

50
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:41,240
That's Hercules.
I really liked that picture.

51
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:46,241
So Hercules goes out into the darkness 
and he's got this container and maybe 

52
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:47,600
you can think of that container as a 
cultural artifact.

53
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:52,601
You know,
because the culture protects you from 

54
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:53,420
chaos and then the question is what are 
you supposed to do with that protection?

55
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,080
And the answer is you're supposed to 
wear the garb of the lion,

56
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:58,760
right?
That's the king of the beasts.

57
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:03,761
So that's supposed to be you and you're 
supposed to go out there into the 

58
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:06,871
darkest with your bloody eyes open so 
you can discover what's in the darkness 

59
00:03:06,871 --> 00:03:07,870
and share with everyone else,
and he's got a club.

60
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,180
They're in his hands and the club was 
covered with eyes.

61
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:15,181
Those are eyes not barbs.
And what that means is that you should 

62
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:17,200
bloody well pay attention and that well,
the other element of that,

63
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,350
it's not expressed in that image that 
you should also speak carefully,

64
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,300
pay attention,
and speak carefully,

65
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,570
and then you're the proper son of the 
proper father and you can keep things 

66
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,810
functioning and that makes you into 
this.

67
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,170
Right?
So the city is always threatened.

68
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:37,171
It's always corrupt and threatened and 
there's always something outside that's 

69
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:40,351
going to take it down always.
And that's what's represented by the 

70
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:44,041
Dragon.
That little twist and its tail is 

71
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,171
something that represents infinity.
And the courageous individual goes out 

72
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:49,831
of the damage city to confront the 
dragon of chaos into gained something 

73
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:54,420
valuable as a consequence,
and that's what human beings are 

74
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,350
supposed to do.
That's our destiny.

75
00:03:56,351 --> 00:04:01,351
That's our soul.
That's a better way of thinking about 

76
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:01,570
it,
and some of that terrible dragon is just

77
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:06,571
the catastrophe and suffering of life 
and our continual attempts to 

78
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:09,991
transcendent,
but a tremendous amount of it is also 

79
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:12,541
the malevolence and the evil that exists
in our own hearts and in society and 

80
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,280
perhaps to some degree,
even in the world itself.

81
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,490
You're supposed to wake up and 
strengthen yourself and stand up 

82
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,091
properly and fortify yourself so that 
you're a light that can shine in the 

83
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:27,250
darkness and that's something that can 
withstand malevolence and tragedy.

84
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,970
And what's your alternative?
You're going to let life crush you and 

85
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,440
make you weak and make you resentful and
bitter and then murderous.

86
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,740
You'll take out your rage on everyone 
you can and it'll only be limited by 

87
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,970
your capacity to obtain power.
That's not a good thing.

88
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,300
And so it's this way,
or it's this way or a way that leads 

89
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,810
directly to hell and we've certainly 
seen that plenty of times in the last 

90
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,440
hundred years and you'd think we might 
have learned our lesson,

91
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,720
but it takes a lot for people to learn 
and we're in danger of repeating exactly

92
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:00,010
the same mistakes again.

93
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,660
So you know,
it's one thing to complain about the 

94
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,140
political polarization and it's another 
thing to point fingers out.

95
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:12,870
The postmodernist send the Neo Marxists 
even though they,

96
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,920
they roundly deserve it.
In my estimation.

97
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,460
It's another thing to try to figure out 
what the proper alternative is.

98
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:23,280
And a proper alternative is not,
in my estimation,

99
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:27,240
to contribute to political polarization.
It's not good.

100
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:30,600
And it's not that the radical right is 
the solution to the radical left.

101
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,690
It's just another catastrophe.
And the only solution that I've been 

102
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,231
able to figure out,
and this is as a consequence of much 

103
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:41,811
reading and much thinking,
is that it's up to the individuals in 

104
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:45,291
our society is sort themselves out and 
to strengthen themselves and to become 

105
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,600
wise and alert and to shoulder the 
responsibility of being.

106
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,780
And the demand,
the ethical demand to pushback 

107
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:53,790
malevolence in their own hearts and in 
their society.

108
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,190
And I also believe that,
you know,

109
00:05:56,191 --> 00:06:01,191
it's very difficult for people to 
respect themselves because they're weak 

110
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:02,300
and vulnerable and pathetic and 
malevolent.

111
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,210
And so it's no and they're not what they
could be and they know it.

112
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,760
And so it's no wonder that people don't 
respect themselves.

113
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,940
And some of that's nature and some of 
that's culture and some of it's 

114
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,551
individual weakness.
But one of the things that I've learned 

115
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,120
and it's about the only optimistic 
thought I've ever come across is that if

116
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:22,121
you have enough courage to forthrightly 
accept the fact that you're vulnerable 

117
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:24,380
and malevolent and you're willing to do 
something about it,

118
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:29,381
to overcome it,
you can develop enough respect for 

119
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:31,811
yourself so that the terrible way of 
being will not make you malevolent and 

120
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:33,830
corrupt.
And I don't think that you have anything

121
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:37,340
better to aim for unless you want blood 
in the streets in a pathetic life.

122
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,550
And so you might as well straighten up 
and get your act together.

123
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:44,330
And maybe we've got some chance of 
getting through this intermediary period

124
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:49,331
of chaos that we all face and make 
something better out of it instead of 

125
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:51,950
something worse.
So that's what I have to say about that.

126
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,520
So thank you.
Thank you.
