1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,450
I was reading a study the other day on 
marital stability.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,570
Gottman has done some really good 
analysis of couples behavior.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,300
He has set up a lab that's basically a 
bed and breakfast and he brings couples 

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,861
in there for a weekend and he had wires 
the mop physiologically and monitors 

5
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:26,391
their reactivity and so what is he can 
predict whether a couple's going to 

6
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:27,180
divorce with 95,
94 percent accuracy.

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,240
It's like impressive.
So what is he found?

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,620
He found two categories of.
He's.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,430
He's identified two phenomena that are 
very much worth knowing.

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,090
The first is that the couples who are 
going to get divorced and they come into

11
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:49,800
the bed and breakfast and they speak 
with each other quite commonly,

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,960
but it's more walking on eggs calm and 
while they're speaking with each other,

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,630
normally their physiology is like 
they're very aroused and so.

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,490
So they're sort of aroused like someone 
who's facing a predator.

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,700
So you might think about not unhappy,
couple as Predator and prey to each 

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,991
other.
And so the words are there mostly to 

17
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:15,910
stop predatory activity,
not to actually communicate anything.

18
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:19,450
It's just to keep the surface calm.
So then you might think,

19
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:24,451
well,
what's under the surface and what it's 

20
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,810
under the surface.
So Freud would say it's what's under the

21
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:30,040
surface is unconscious and,
but you can say,

22
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,840
well,
what's under the surface is one of these

23
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,990
hierarchies and it's all banged up and 
twisted and,

24
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,070
and not in reasonable shape.
And so people don't want to open the 

25
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:40,780
door to that.
So.

26
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,150
But they do.
And this is a Freudian slip.

27
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:46,840
So let's say this goes to the second 
part of the Gottman's observations.

28
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:47,950
So

29
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,470
the woman goes over to the window and 
she says,

30
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,810
oh look,
there's a cardinal outside,

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,950
you know,
cardinals,

32
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,960
that bright red bird,
that kind of cool looking,

33
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,170
you know,
it's kind of a trivial thing in some 

34
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:04,170
sense,
but by the same token,

35
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,640
it's like it's a little positive thing 
and you know,

36
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,270
20 of them in a day's good thing.
Okay?

37
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:11,480
So then the,
uh,

38
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,010
the partner,
the husband in this example has a two by

39
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:18,160
two matrix of choices.
One is,

40
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,980
who the hell cares about your stupid 
bird?

41
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,240
Okay,
so that's one.

42
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,950
The second one is then you go over and 
look at the bird,

43
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,520
right?
And then the third one is you don't make

44
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:35,521
the contempt noise but you act it out 
and the fourth one is you go over there 

45
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,570
like a civilized human being and you 
know,

46
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:40,720
and that you're interacting with someone
that you care for and you take a look at

47
00:02:40,721 --> 00:02:42,650
the damn bird and you're happy about it 
and it.

48
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,440
And that's as truthful and real as you 
can manage.

49
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,240
Okay,
so the option,

50
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,210
that's a Freudian slip,
right?

51
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Because what it says,
there's a whole monster underneath that 

52
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,481
and the monster,
all the disorganization in this entire 

53
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:05,890
structure.
It's like the might be.

54
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,030
We have been tormenting each other about
various things for the last 10 years and

55
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:17,521
none of them are resolved and I'm not 
very happy about you for so many 

56
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:22,321
reasons.
I can't even remember all of them and I 

57
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:25,291
can't enumerate them right now because 
that would take forever and maybe we 

58
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,520
would have a huge fight.
But by the same token,

59
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,660
I'm not going to come over there and 
make you happy with your stupid bird and

60
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:36,661
I'm going to indicate that suddenly so 
you can't call me a son of a bitch 

61
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:38,410
because I've just sighing and that's 
what I'll say if you do ask me,

62
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,830
but I'm going to load all that up and 
I'm going to deliver it to you.

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,500
And what's going to happen to you is 
because you're smart,

64
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,200
is your heart rate's going to go way up,
like you're being attacked.

65
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:51,700
And the reason for that is you are.
So what the good couples do,

66
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:55,240
the couples that you know will stay 
together is they respond to each other's

67
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:56,680
bids.
He calls them bids.

68
00:03:56,681 --> 00:04:01,681
And so if one person wants to share some
little trivial daily positive thing with

69
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:03,010
the other,
the other,

70
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:08,130
you know,
isn't carrying around a bloody cartload 

71
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,050
of resentment and is able to respond to 
that in a positive way.

72
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:15,940
And that way the general interactions 
between the couples stay positive.

73
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:18,910
But that's also because they've worked 
this out.

74
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,810
Now,
you know it's got to be because they 

75
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,990
work it out because the couples who are 
physiologically reactive to each other,

76
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,140
they're communicating,
but there's all sorts of horror 

77
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,690
underneath the surface and we're trying 
to figure out,

78
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:36,691
well,
what is it that's underneath the 

79
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:36,691
surface?
What's the structure of the unconscious?

80
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,030
Well,
that's the structure of the unconscious 

81
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,121
and it's either well structured and 
functional and mutually agreed upon and 

82
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:50,170
as explicit as possible,
or it's this constantly.
