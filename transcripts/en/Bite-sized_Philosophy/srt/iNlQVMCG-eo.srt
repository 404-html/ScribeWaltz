1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:04,360
How would you summarize why men are in 
crisis now?

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,860
I think it's because it in a deep level,
the West has lost faith in the idea of 

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,571
masculinity.
Now that's no different than the death 

4
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,700
of God.
It's the same thing and so and need chip

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,280
knew what the consequences of that would
be.

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,730
I mean that's most of what he wrote 
about and so you'd say,

7
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:29,731
well,
the divine symbol of masculinity has 

8
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:29,731
been obliterated.
Well,

9
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:31,960
so then what do you expect?
What's going to happen?

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,900
It's going to.
That means masculinity is going to 

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,961
become weak,
and especially if the symbol is also 

12
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:40,570
denigrated,
right?

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,660
Which it definitely is.
So what that means is that the ideal 

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,510
that man could aspire to is denigrated,
and while then with your ideal in 

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,530
tatters,
you're weak.

16
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,270
That's,
that's definitional.

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,530
So I think the reason that men have been
responding positively to my,

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,810
my thinking,
let's say,

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,740
is that I don't buy any of that.
I like the masculine spirit.

20
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,020
It's necessary and it's not 
fundamentally

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,470
carnage and pillaging.
It's not fundamentally rape culture.

22
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,130
No,
it's not fundamentally world destroying 

23
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,090
and all of those things have been.
All of those aspersions have been cast 

24
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,841
upon it.
That's partly the guilt of Western 

25
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:42,260
Society for technological progress even,
and those are reasonable challenges to 

26
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:48,531
be set before men,
but they're not reasonable accusations 

27
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:54,510
to swallow without criticism.
What is a masculinity we can aspire to?

28
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,930
Well,
it's a responsibility fundamentally and 

29
00:01:59,930 --> 00:01:59,930
and it's,
it's,

30
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,080
it's to,
to put it symbolically is that your 

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,300
responsibility is to incarnate the 
spirit of the logos.

32
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,140
That's your responsibility.
That's your role in life,

33
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,830
and that is independent to some degree 
in whether or not you accept the idea of

34
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:22,341
a transcendent eternal reality.
Now I'm not making a case for that or 

35
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,540
against that I,
those things are beyond human 

36
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,200
understanding,
but we know what happens if people act 

37
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:36,330
poorly.
If men act badly,

38
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,680
we know what happens.

39
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,190
We know that the world turns into 
something that's so close to hell,

40
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:46,191
but the difference is trivial.
We know that that's the story of the 

41
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:50,781
20th century,
so we should learn that lesson and what 

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,200
that lesson is is pick up the world on 
your shoulders and walk forward,

43
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,410
pick up the world with all of its 
trouble,

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,440
with all of it's suffering with all of 
its evil and move forward with it and in

45
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:10,051
bearing that burden learned that you 
were that sort of creature that can bear

46
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:14,200
that burden and therefore deserving of 
respect.

47
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,410
That's,
that's the,

48
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,230
that's identification with the logos and
that's.

49
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,650
I don't,
I've never encountered an idea that's 

50
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,650
better than that because it's not.
It's so not naive.

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,520
It's the opposite of naive.
It's like there's terrible evil and 

52
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,730
there's terrible suffering.
It's a bottomless,

53
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,750
but the human spirit is capable of 
voluntarily taking that on as a 

54
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,800
challenge.
Well,

55
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,920
it's worth a try.

56
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,040
Yes,
exactly.

57
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:54,850
That's,
that's,

58
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,650
that's,
that's the positive.

59
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:58,660
Meaning.
That's the positive meaning.

60
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:00,880
That's the world affirming,
meaning you know,

61
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:04,270
and that that's that self esteem,
let's say,

62
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,110
you know,
which is very poorly characterized.

63
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,320
It's very shallowly characterized 
because it usually doesn't involve any 

64
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,350
sense of responsibility,
but you know,

65
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,010
it's obvious if you.
It's obvious in some ways if you look at

66
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:26,200
the people that other people 
spontaneously respect,

67
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,680
unless they've become unbelievably 
cynical,

68
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,120
it's the people who adopt responsibility
and deal with it competently,

69
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,460
so it's not a mystery that that would be
what you could aspire to.

70
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,490
Now it it gets undermined if you feel 
that that force of responsibility is the

71
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,920
raping and pillaging patriarchal culture
that's despoiling the natural 

72
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,560
environment and that's equivalent to a 
cancer.

73
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,430
Well,
you know,

74
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,400
no,
I don't buy that.
