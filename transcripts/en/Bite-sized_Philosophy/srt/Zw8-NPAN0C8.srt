1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,290
What happens with the postmodernist as 
they say,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:07,530
oh,
there's an infinite number of 

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:07,530
interpretations,
and then the human part of them goes,

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,450
okay,
well what am I supposed to do next?

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,800
Then since there's an infinite number of
choices and the postmodernist says,

6
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:16,210
well,
my theory can't account for that,

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,260
and then they say,
well,

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,290
back to Marxism,
and so that's why I think there's this 

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,961
unholy alliance between the 
postmodernists and the Neo Marxists 

10
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:28,150
because postmodernism is a is a dead end
from the perspective of applicable 

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,641
wisdom.
It leaves you bereft and nihilistic and 

12
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:36,181
that's not good because people can't 
exist without a purpose and so they 

13
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:39,571
sneak the Marxism through the back door 
and and jump into this power landscape 

14
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:41,080
for the reasons that we discussed 
earlier.

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,100
So I really think that it's because of 
an infinite number of possibilities 

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,041
interpretating things because I've 
always felt that it was really just a 

17
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:49,041
response to capitalism.

18
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:52,940
The capitalism is a very negative aspect
of our culture and society and that 

19
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:54,900
there's gotta be some sort of an 
alternative.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Marxism is a clearly defined alternative
that other people have subscribed to in 

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,990
the past.
You could point to it,

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,850
it's a structure that's already are 
already set up and it's romanticized and

23
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:10,851
I think they adopted for that reason 
because it has a socialist aspects 

24
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:12,780
attached to it and they looked at 
socialism as some sort of a thing that a

25
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,760
regards equality and uh,
you know,

26
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,790
some sort of an egalitarian.
Well,

27
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,140
okay,
so we'd have to take two things apart.

28
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:25,080
We'd have to take Marxism slash neo,
Marxist,

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,590
Marxism and postmodernism apart.
So we could do that historically.

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,420
And I would say that although there is a
reason for postmodernism,

31
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,390
which is the reason we just discussed,
that the landscape,

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,850
the infinite landscape of interpretation
problem,

33
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:39,660
it's a real problem.

34
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,620
If you look at it historically,
postmodernism actually grew out of 

35
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:45,640
Marxism.
And so what,

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,120
what,
what happened is that the Marxists laid 

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,120
out their,
their,

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,640
their theory about the human social 
environment being composed of a power 

39
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:58,560
struggle between the privileged and the 
underprivileged,

40
00:01:58,561 --> 00:01:59,650
right?
The rich and the poor.

41
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,110
And in its initial phases.
And that's a story that's partially true

42
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,290
and it's got a lot of motive power.
Like the motive power is the romantic 

43
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,311
motive power that you just described.
I get to be on this side of the 

44
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:13,311
oppressed.
I get to be a war.

45
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:15,120
You're for what's right.
There's the resentment element,

46
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,160
which is that son of a bitch has more 
than me,

47
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:22,161
so let's cut them off at the knees,
which manifested itself brutally in the 

48
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:26,300
Soviet Union and then there's the 
ideological totality issue which gives 

49
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,781
people a sense of security that took a 
vicious hit by by the late 19 sixties 

50
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:34,611
because the murderousness of Marxism had
been clearly laid out as a doctrine and 

51
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:38,511
that opened the door to this move by by 
mostly French intellectuals to to 

52
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,620
develop the postmodern philosophy which 
has these advantages which we described,

53
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:49,050
but also to use that as a screening 
tactic for allowing Marxism to transform

54
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:51,840
into identity politics and so like.

55
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,870
It's hard to disentangle all the 
motivations that are going on in there,

56
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:59,871
but there's something about it that's 
that's truly intellectually 

57
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:03,351
pathological.
Because you don't get to be a 

58
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:05,881
postmodernist and a Marxist.
You actually technically cannot be both 

59
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:10,291
of those things at the same time.
And the fact that most people are both 

60
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,981
of those things at the same time raises 
the specter of just exactly what their 

61
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:19,021
motivation is.
And then I would say it's this 

62
00:03:19,021 --> 00:03:21,361
resentment driven anti capitalism,
and there's reasons to criticize 

63
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:25,801
capitalism obviously,
but it's this underground resentment 

64
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:27,490
driven anti-capitalism that I think is 
one of the fundamental motivators.
