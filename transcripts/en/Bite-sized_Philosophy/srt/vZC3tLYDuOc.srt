1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
It's very easy to romanticize nature,
especially if you're a city dweller 

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,450
who's never had to,
you know,

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,900
wander out in the northern woods in the 
middle of the summer and get eaten by 

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,411
black flies and mosquitoes starving to 
death while trying to track down an 

5
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:17,820
animal.
It's very easy to romanticize nature.

6
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:22,821
Of course,
cancer and other diseases tend to 

7
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:24,420
disabuse you of the pure beauty of 
nature and nature is a very,

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,490
very destructive force.
It's,

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,370
it's against us all the time as well as 
for us,

10
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:34,371
and another thing that's really not well
balanced in our society is the anti 

11
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:38,940
humanism that's become part and parcel 
of radical discussions everywhere.

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,910
Human beings are regarded as a cancer on
the planet.

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,930
To quote the what was that?
The Club of Rome worrying about the 

14
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:52,071
population explosion and we're all 
guilty because we're destroying things 

15
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:53,370
as fast as we can possibly manage.
It's like Jesus,

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,890
everything around us is always trying to
kill us.

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,320
Most of the time we're just trying to 
stay alive.

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,530
I mean we're not perfect.
We're corrupt and sore or social 

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:03,960
structures and people get greedy and 
careless,

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,260
but it's not like nature's all shining.
A wonderful young lady waiting in the 

21
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:14,961
wilderness to embrace us positively.
It's the old hag that's going to kill 

22
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:18,330
you every possible way and you need to 
defend yourself against that.

23
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:23,331
And you know,
human beings have only been in the 

24
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:25,401
position since 1960 since we ever had 
any conceptualization of our potential 

25
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:29,040
to change the planet on a planetary 
scale.

26
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,650
It's been like four generations,
you know,

27
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:36,651
back in the eighties and nineties.
Thomas Huxley was commissioned by the 

28
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:40,491
English parliament to,
to investigate the carrying capacity of 

29
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:43,800
the oceans and his.
He was a great biologist.

30
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,010
His report was that there are so damn 
many fish in the ocean that every human 

31
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,181
being could fish every day for the rest 
of his life and catch everything he 

32
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:55,170
possibly could and we wouldn't put a 
dent in it.

33
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,310
And that's,
you know,

34
00:01:56,311 --> 00:02:01,311
that's only a 120 years ago.
We only woke up to the fact that we 

35
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:03,450
became a planetary force.
And in 19 six states like,

36
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:06,030
what the hell do you expect from people 
you know,

37
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:11,010
we're trying to get herself together as 
fast as we can and might be decent of us

38
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:16,011
to stop with the anti human rhetoric,
which is only going to lead to a bad 

39
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:16,170
end.
You know,

40
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,750
if human beings are nothing but a cancer
on the planet,

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,850
then it's the bloody hero who 
obliterates them.

42
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:23,490
Isn't that because it's the hero.
He gets rid of cancer.

43
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,970
And when people watch the school 
shooters in the mass shooters and they 

44
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:28,970
think,
well,

45
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,411
what is it that motivates people like 
that in which they could figure out 

46
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:34,330
about half an hour if they did the 
proper reading,

47
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,220
just read what they wrote.
Human beings are a cancer on the planet.

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,290
Being as evil.
Intrinsically,

49
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,380
I'm going to take out everything I can 
to show my displeasure with the 

50
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,251
structure of reality and then I'm going 
to shoot myself just to show you how 

51
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:50,940
little I care.
And if you can't understand that,

52
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:55,941
then you haven't looked very deeply into
your own heart because there could be a 

53
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:55,941
time in your life.
Believe me,

54
00:02:55,941 --> 00:03:00,591
where something terrible happens to you 
so that you'll be able to understand 

55
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:00,591
that perfectly.
