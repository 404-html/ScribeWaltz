1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,410
I worked with this crazy psychologist,
he,

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,170
he used to put jokes on is multiple 
choice tests.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,100
He was a really eccentric guy,
but I really liked his courses.

4
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:16,101
He and he,
he taught a course on creativity and he 

5
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:19,071
was also a prison psychologist and he 
was an eccentric guy and he for some 

6
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:22,110
reason liked me and maybe because I was 
eccentric to and he invited me to go out

7
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:24,720
to the Edmonton maximum security prison 
with them a couple of times,

8
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:29,721
which I did.
And that was a very interesting 

9
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:31,881
experience because I was trying to 
figure out what role each individual's 

10
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:39,390
behavior bore to the pathology of the 
group with something like that.

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,260
And I went out there and I met with the 
little guy smaller than me.

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,840
I was a little bigger by then and he was
a pretty innocuous guy.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,440
And uh,
what had happened was I was out in this 

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:54,780
gymnasium,
it looks like a high school.

15
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,790
The prison,
which is really quite telling in my 

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:00:59,790
estimation,
but,

17
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,370
and there were all these like monsters 
in their weightlifting and like they 

18
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,591
were monsters.
I remember one guy who was tattooed 

19
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:06,591
everywhere and he had like a huge scar 
running down the middle of his chest.

20
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:09,080
It looked like someone had to hit them 
with an ax and you know,

21
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:14,081
and,
and I was in there and I had this Weird 

22
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:16,341
Cape that I used to wear that I bought 
in Portugal and some boots that went 

23
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:16,341
along with it.

24
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,970
Yeah,
it was like an 1890 sherlock Holmes Cape

25
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:23,310
and it was really like,
it was from the 18 nineties because this

26
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:28,311
little village was up on a hill.
It was a walled city on a hill and they 

27
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:30,360
sold these things and I don't think 
they've changed the style since 1890.

28
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:32,820
And so I thought they were really cool 
and so I was wearing that,

29
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:37,821
which wasn't perhaps the most 
conservative garb to dawn if you're 

30
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:46,131
going to wear,
if you're going to go to a maximum 

31
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:46,131
security prison.
So anyways,

32
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:47,180
I was in the gymnasium and the 
psychologist,

33
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,070
the psychologist left and God only 
knows.

34
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,060
I mean that's what he was like.
And all these guys came around.

35
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,320
All these guys came around me,
you know,

36
00:01:55,321 --> 00:02:00,321
and they were offering to trade their 
prison clothes for my cape and he was 

37
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,340
like,
I was being made an offer I couldn't 

38
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:07,340
refuse,
you know,

39
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:07,340
and so I didn't,
I didn't really know what to do.

40
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,790
And then this little guy said something 
like that,

41
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,980
the psychologist sent me to come and 
take you away or something like that.

42
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,220
And so I thought,
well better this little guy then all 

43
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,370
these monsters.
So we went outside the gym through some 

44
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:24,870
doors,
like school doors,

45
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,140
went outside the gym into the exercise 
yard I guess,

46
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:33,141
and we're wandering along and he was 
talking to me and he seemed like a kind 

47
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:35,931
of an innocuous guy.
And then the psychologist showed up at 

48
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:36,120
the door and motioned us back.
And so,

49
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,450
which was kind of a relief.
And so I went into his office and he 

50
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:41,450
said,
you know,

51
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,120
that guy that you walked out in the yard
with?

52
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:42,810
And I said,
yeah.

53
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:44,250
He said he,
uh,

54
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,940
he took two cops one night and he had 
them kneel down and while they were 

55
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,631
begging for their lives,
he shot them both in the back of the 

56
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:53,631
head.

57
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,020
And I thought,
hmm,

58
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,590
that's.
See the thing that was so interesting 

59
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,260
was that he was so innocuous,
right?

60
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:06,070
Because what you'd hope is that someone 
like that would be very much unlike you,

61
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,100
let's say,
and certainly wouldn't be like somewhat 

62
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,950
innocuous that you'd met.
What you'd want is that the guy would be

63
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:16,951
like half world wolf and half vampire so
you could just tell right away that he 

64
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:18,070
was a cold blooded killer.
But no,

65
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:23,071
he was this sort of ineffectual little 
guy who was certainly not ineffectual if

66
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:25,000
you gave them a revolver and the upper 
hand.

67
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,960
And so,
so that made me think that made me think

68
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:33,670
a lot about the relationship between 
being innocuous and being dangerous.

69
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:38,671
And then another thing happened.
I met another guy out there and then a 

70
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:42,990
week or two later I heard that he and a 
friend of his had held another guy down 

71
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,060
and pulverized his left leg with a lead 
pipe,

72
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,910
like just pulverized it.

73
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,150
And the reason for that was that they 
thought that he was a snitch and maybe 

74
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,070
he was and that that time I did 
something different and instead of being

75
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,500
shocked and horrified by that,
although I certainly was,

76
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,800
I thought,
how in the world could you do that?

77
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,510
Because I didn't think I could do that.
Hey,

78
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,570
I didn't think that.
I thought that there was a qualitative 

79
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,181
distinction between me and those people.
And so I spent about two weeks trying to

80
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:17,830
see if I could figure out under what 
conditions I could do that.

81
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Like what kind of psychological 
transformation I would have to undergo 

82
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,850
to be able to do that.
And so that was a meditative exercise,

83
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:28,000
let's say.
And it only took about 10 days for me to

84
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:33,001
realize that not only could I do that,
that it would be a hell of a lot easier 

85
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:33,001
than I thought it would be.

86
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,130
And that sort of where that wall between
me and what you described is the shadow 

87
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,890
started to fall apart and that also was 
very useful because I started to.

88
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,430
I started to treat myself as somewhat 
different entity because I hadn't been 

89
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,070
aware up to that point,
you know,

90
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:53,071
because I thought I was a good guy and 
there's no reason for me to think that 

91
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:54,790
because you're not a good guy unless you
really made a bloody effort to be a good

92
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,990
guy.
You're just not.

93
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,260
It's not easy and so you're probably a 
moderately bad guy and that's a long 

94
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:03,760
ways from being an absolutely horrible 
guy,

95
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,340
but it's also a long ways from being a 
good guy.

96
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:11,341
And so.
But I had a little more respect for 

97
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:13,351
myself after that because I also 
understood that there was a monstrous 

98
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:18,421
element to the human psyche that,
that you needed to respect and that was 

99
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,690
part of you.
That you should regard yourself in some 

100
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,121
sense as a loaded weapon.
It's very useful around children to 

101
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:28,540
regard yourself as a loaded weapon 
because around children you are a loaded

102
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:33,541
weapon and the terrible experiences that
many children have with their parents 

103
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,420
are testament to that.
