1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,500
Stolen,
same thing,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:07,620
Stalin the great father,
right wise man at the helm of the ship 

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,310
of the state.
This is after the wall came down,

4
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:13,000
some old man kissing a,
a gilded statue,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,850
Stalin before it's going to be before 
it's going to be torn down.

6
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:20,851
There he is with happy children and not 
the children that his policies starve to

7
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:22,840
death as you,
as you might.

8
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:25,900
Well imagine.
There is in his military uniform sitting

9
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,000
on what's all,
for all intents and purposes,

10
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,450
a throne.
And this is,

11
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,140
this is really an uncanny one.
It's very positive,

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,050
right?
That's Hitler is or still in his head of

13
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:38,110
state.
He's in this hellish Mendola of fire.

14
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,080
Perfect with God the father at his head.
That's Lennon.

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,310
You know who people still,
who people still revere.

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,500
Um,
you may know and perhaps you don't,

17
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:50,710
that I was nominated to be rector of the
University of Glasgow.

18
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,960
And so,
which is an honorary position.

19
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:57,961
And today,
yesterday the different candidates put 

20
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:01,570
up their manifestos in the student 
newspaper,

21
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:06,490
put them up and then wrote analysis of 
the manifestos which were biased.

22
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,700
And there were appallingly biased in one
sided.

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,250
And I wrote and told them that they 
said,

24
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:14,050
well,
we have a perfect right to our political

25
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:14,980
opinion.
And I thought,

26
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:15,970
yeah,
well for sure,

27
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:20,971
but you know,
you are journalists after all and maybe 

28
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:21,850
you could be just trying to tell what's 
happening.

29
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:22,330
It's like,
no,

30
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:23,080
no,
no,

31
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:25,930
there's none of that.
And they said that one of the candidates

32
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:26,770
that they,
uh,

33
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,460
that they clearly recommended who seems 
to be a person who's perfectly heroic in

34
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:34,990
his own right.
I mean he's taken on very many difficult

35
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:39,991
legal cases and,
and worked for the oppressed and 

36
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:41,000
downtrodden who clearly exist.
Um,

37
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,530
it was either him or another candidate 
doesn't really matter that they 

38
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,510
described as bolshy and an outspoken 
Bolshie meaning Bolshevik,

39
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:50,140
like,
it's like,

40
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:50,620
well,
you know,

41
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:51,900
he's appropriately Bolshie.

42
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,830
It's like,
it's no different than saying,

43
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,630
well,
he's appropriately not see.

44
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:57,700
Like,
like what the hell is that?

45
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,820
I mean there were 50 million people that
were killed in the Soviet Union by the 

46
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,360
bowl.
She's and maybe twice that many in,

47
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,720
in China that,
that says nothing about Cambodia and all

48
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:10,720
the other places there were radical left
blood bass.

49
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:14,840
You think it's cute to call someone 
Bolshie Jesus appalling.

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,540
It's appalling.
It's not some fashionable thing that you

51
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:23,541
do.
It's participation in some of the 

52
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,361
deepest intellectual morasses of evil 
that human beings have ever managed to 

53
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:27,840
create,
and yet it's fashionable.

54
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,090
It shows you what,
what the universities are worth.

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,060
Well,
there's the downside of Stella.

56
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,080
Yeah.
Stella,

57
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,450
in his hangman,
that sort of cartoon would've gotten you

58
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:42,451
killed in the Soviet Union.
There are Stellan as st himself in a 

59
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:46,221
stained glass representation.
There's a statue of Stella and covered 

60
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:50,290
with red paint for the blood after the 
wall came down there Stellan as what?

61
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,710
It's very much like Medina's Satan,
right?

62
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,230
You look at that and it's exactly the 
same.

63
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:57,390
Marketable idea.
There's the Americans going.

64
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,940
It had a cap in hand,
get a little large.

65
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:01,240
Yes.
From Papa Stellan.

66
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,310
That's a painting of the Communists,
forcibly collectivizing,

67
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:10,300
the productive farmers in the Soviet 
Union in the early 19 twenties.

68
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:14,220
The kulaks right.
Everything from whom they stole and rape

69
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,370
them and murdered them and ship them off
to Siberia and killed them and wiped out

70
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:23,371
the productive farmers of the Soviet 
Union and then starved 6 million 

71
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:27,691
Ukrainians to death.
And there is some poor kid in the 19 

72
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:27,730
thirties who's ribs are showing,
you know,

73
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,790
taking a bath in this part with his eyes
wide.

74
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:35,791
And you know,
he's one of the fortunate ones because 

75
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:35,791
he's still alive.
It's like bull sheet.

76
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,760
Yeah.
Cute.

77
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,150
Pretty Fun.
Fashionable,

78
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,170
lovely.
