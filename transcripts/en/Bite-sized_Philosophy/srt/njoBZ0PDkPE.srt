00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,710
One of the things that has just blown me
away in the last year,

2
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:06,860
because I've talked to lots of people,
lots of people live,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,590
you know,
but also lots of people online,

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,080
but it's more obvious live and it's 
obvious in this theater as well,

5
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:13,380
is that I've,
I've,

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,450
I've gone around and spoken and a large 
proportion of my audience has been young

7
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:19,800
man,
you know,

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,950
under 30,
something like that and I've spoken to 

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,441
them a lot about responsibility and 
what's so odd about about this is that 

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,800
of all the things that I've spoken about
because I can see the audience and I can

11
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:38,801
feel how the audience is reacting 
because I'm always paying attention to 

12
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:39,020
all of you.
It's in so far as I can manage that.

13
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:43,940
So I get some sense of how what I'm 
saying is landing.

14
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,970
You know,
which you have to do if you're going to 

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,651
speak effectively to people and what.
What happens is if I talk about 

16
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:54,581
responsibilities,
everyone b is silent just like they are 

17
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:56,000
now silent and,
and not moving,

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,250
right?
Focusing attentive,

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,610
say pick up your responsibility,
pickup the heaviest thing you can and 

20
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,021
carry it and the room goes quiet and 
everybody's eyes open and I think that 

21
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:11,930
who making me break up,
I was.

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,820
I don't,
I don't know why I was speaking to an 

23
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,720
English journalist today.
You're just going to write an article in

24
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,820
Spectator magazine.
I was talking about this and at the same

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,390
point in the discussion the same,
I had the same emotional reaction.

26
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:35,370
I don't really understand it.
It's.

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,520
I think it's something.
There's something about it that's so 

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,161
crucial because you know,
we've been fed this unending diet of 

29
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:44,460
rights and freedoms and there's 
something about that,

30
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,670
especially if there's something about 
that that so pathologically wrong and 

31
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,811
people are starving for the antidote.
And the antidote is truth and 

32
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:54,300
responsibility,
right?

33
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:59,301
And it isn't,
it isn't because that's what you should 

34
00:01:59,301 --> 00:01:59,301
do in some,
you know,

35
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:03,970
some,
some I know better or someone knows 

36
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,180
better for you what you should do sense.
It's that.

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,380
It's that,
it's that,

38
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,710
it's that that's the secret to a 
meaningful life and without a meaningful

39
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:12,390
life,
then all you have is suffering.

40
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,390
And,
and nihilism and despair and all of 

41
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,700
that,
and self contempt and that's not good,

42
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:22,701
and so the man hits necessary for men to
stand up and take responsibility and 

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
they all know that and and are starving 
for that message and the message is more

44
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:34,791
that that's also a good thing to stand 
up and take responsibility because 

45
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:35,580
you're cursed so much now,
from,

46
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,330
from,
from,

47
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,390
from when you're young with this notion 
that your active engagement with the 

48
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,760
world is part of what is destroying and 
undermining the planet and adding to the

49
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:46,740
tyranny of the social systems.
It's like,

50
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,630
how about not so much that,
hey,

51
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,310
because it's instant,
it's,

52
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,270
it's to soul deadening.
It's andy human right to the core and my

53
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:55,980
sense instead is that,
you know,

54
00:02:55,981 --> 00:03:00,981
if you,
if you were able to reveal the best of 

55
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:04,671
yourself to you in the world,
that you would be an overwhelming force 

56
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:04,671
for good.
