1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:06,370
So God's upset because he had made man 
on earth and it grieved him at his 

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:06,370
heart,
and God says,

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,841
I will destroy man,
whom I've created from the face of the 

4
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:13,271
earth,
both man and beast and the creeping 

5
00:00:13,271 --> 00:00:14,420
thing and the fowls of the air for I 
repent that I've made them.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,120
But Noah found grace in the eyes of the 
Lord.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,280
Okay,
so that's an interesting thing.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,310
So here what we have is the question is 
the whole world's in chaos at this 

9
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,770
point,
right in this point in the story.

10
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:29,890
And the chaos is multiple sorts.
It's,

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,970
it arose from the fall.
It rose from the emergence of self 

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:34,970
consciousness.
It emerged.

13
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,240
Safe arose from the sins of cane,
like things are not going well.

14
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:43,241
It's multiple levels of collapse.
And it's got to the point where God 

15
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:46,820
saying this is a mess,
like it's such a mess that the whole 

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:46,820
thing has to be washed away.

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,310
The first fall wasn't enough.
Even canes collapse wasn't enough.

18
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:52,010
We're going to just scrub the whole 
bloody thing clean.

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,370
So it's,
it's the ultimate in traumatic 

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:57,370
collapses.
The question is,

21
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,810
well,
what do you do in the face of the 

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,170
ultimate in traumatic collapses?
And the answer is in the story.

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,550
So Noah is someone who finds fate,
who finds favor in the eyes of God,

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,700
so he's like able.
There's something that Noaa is doing 

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,640
right that's going to enable him to ride
out the storm.

26
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,220
And so the question here,
it's the same question.

27
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,160
Do you want to have a life where there's
no storms

28
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,580
or do you want to have a life where you 
can ride out the storms?

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,830
That's the issue,
right?

30
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,900
Are you behind the dikes or do you build
a boat?

31
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,970
Do you captain the boat?
That's the same idea.

32
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,030
So the idea here is that the thing that 
rides out the chaos is the thing that 

33
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,010
builds and captains the boat.
It's another dominance hierarchy idea.

34
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:40,140
What should be at the top?
Well,

35
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,320
the top of something that doesn't get 
flooded out as well.

36
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:44,760
What should be at the top?
Well,

37
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,460
it's to be the boat builder and to be 
the captain of the boat,

38
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,520
it's not to be hidden from the flood.
Precisely.

39
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,790
And so,
I mean,

40
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,490
here's,
here's,

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,010
here's something to think about,
identity,

42
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,680
identity politics,
because that's what we're up to our neck

43
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:00,610
yet,
okay,

44
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,180
are you who you are?
Can I box you?

45
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,510
Will,
will you accept that as an identity?

46
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,800
So I could do that.
Lots of ways.

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,210
You're male,
your Asia,

48
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,620
you're young,
right?

49
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,710
There's things about you that I can 
derive because of your putative 

50
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,341
membership in a set of different groups.
The problem with doing that is that the 

51
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:22,320
number of groups that I can assign 
youtube is without.

52
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:27,321
And so I have to pick arbitrary groups 
to assign you to and you can accept that

53
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,630
if you want,
but there's no evidence that those are 

54
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,581
the proper canonical groups.
But maybe you're happy about that 

55
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:37,581
because now you've been assigned 
membership in a group and that's your 

56
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:37,581
identity.
Okay?

57
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:38,280
So the question is,
well,

58
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,110
fine,
what happens when that identity is blown

59
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:45,420
into pieces?
Then what?

60
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,650
Well,
here's,

61
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,680
here's the answer to some degree,
and this is the answer that's embedded 

62
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,200
in the story of Noah.

63
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,770
If you want it withstand chaos.
Do you want to be who you are or do you 

64
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:06,610
want to be the thing that changes who 
you are constantly.

65
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,520
That's the question and that's the 
difference.

66
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:14,521
That's the difference.
There's a categorical difference in 

67
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:15,430
identity.
Are you who you are or are you the thing

68
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:20,431
that could continually be more than you 
are and that's the thing that isn't the 

69
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:22,690
stable identity.
It's not the initial state.

70
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,980
It's also not the state of being in 
chaos that nihilistic state,

71
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:31,981
let's say,
and it's not even the state of 

72
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:32,410
reformulation that occurs after you've 
gone through the process.

73
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,010
It's the state of continually going 
through the process so you can identify 

74
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,610
with the thing that trends you could 
identify,

75
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,640
identify with the thing that you are or 
you can identify with the thing that 

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,450
transforms who you are.
Right,

77
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,660
and that's the same as the state 
subjugating itself to the individual 

78
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,020
because the individual is the thing that
transforms the state and what the state 

79
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,681
should do the states necessarily because
obviously it organizes all of us into 

80
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:00,820
peaceful cooperation and competition,
the states necessary.

81
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,030
Then the question is,
is the state the highest good?

82
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,500
And the answer to that is,
well,

83
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:08,290
it can't be because it's old and dead 
and blind,

84
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,540
and so if the state becomes the highest 
good,

85
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,070
then you're occupied by the spirit of 
something that's old and dad and blind.

86
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,100
Well,
that's not only not good for you because

87
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:23,101
then you're old and dead and blind,
but it's also bad for the state because 

88
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:24,040
as soon as the state gets old and dead 
and blind,

89
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,340
God gets unhappy with it and the chaos 
comes in and washes it away.

90
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,810
So it seems like a bad solution.
So what's the proper solution?

91
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,560
You subordinate your group identity to 
the identity that transforms your 

92
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:37,560
identity,
right?

93
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,450
And this state subordinates.
It's power to the vision and 

94
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,250
articulation of the individual because 
that's what revives the state.

95
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,120
And so that's what these stories are 
trying to stumble towards.

96
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,930
Roughly speaking.
