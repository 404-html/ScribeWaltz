1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
Serve traditions,
serve the father a psychologically 

2
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:10,851
speaking,
support the tradition because you live 

3
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:12,510
on it there in the old Mesopotamian 
story,

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,860
um,
the Enuma Elish,

5
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:18,861
which you can,
which you can read about if you're 

6
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:19,740
interested in the original gods who are 
really badly behaved.

7
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:21,270
They're like two year olds.
In fact,

8
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:26,271
there are a lot like two year olds,
they kill the primordial God absolute 

9
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:29,910
who's the Patriarchal God to kill them 
and try to live on his corpse.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,710
Well,
that's what we all do,

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,770
right?
Because we live on a corpse of our 

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,361
ancestors.
You could say we live in the Corpus of 

13
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:40,251
our culture.
It's dead and that's not a great place 

14
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:40,251
to live.
So you have to keep reinventing it.

15
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:43,470
So the damn thing you know,
stays active and awake.

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,670
You stay on the carbs for too long and 
then the devil of or the demon of chaos 

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,170
comes back.

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,060
And that's what happens in the 
Mesopotamian story.

19
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:56,061
It's like don't be thinking that you can
stay on the core of your ancestors for 

20
00:00:56,061 --> 00:01:00,621
too long without contributing to the 
revivification of the system because the

21
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,130
chaos that all of that holds,
that,

22
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,150
that all of that holds,
that Bay will definitely come and visit 

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,990
you and you'll see that in stories like 
a hobbit.

24
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,450
You know hobbits,
they're nice,

25
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:13,680
they like to eat,
they're kind of fat,

26
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:15,030
they're short,
they're not very bright.

27
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,090
You know there are hubris stick.
They have no idea what's out there in 

28
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,090
the broader world.
They're protected.

29
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,861
If you remember by the striders who are 
the sons of great kings who looked like 

30
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:26,190
tramps,
they have nothing but contempt for them.

31
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,640
They patrol the borders and keep the 
bloody hobbits safe,

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,500
but they're out there in the periphery.
All Hell is brewing and chaos is,

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,180
is,
is generating,

34
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:41,230
informing,
and that's an archetypal story and 

35
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,480
that's why people liked that story so 
much because that's exactly right.

36
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,530
Like we're the hobbits and there are,
we are protected from chaos by the 

37
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,580
spirits of our dead ancestors and we're 
too damn stupid to know it and we think,

38
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:52,650
oh well we don't need them anymore.
And that to me,

39
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:57,651
that's postmodernism.
That's what the bloody universities are 

40
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,250
doing with the humanities to absolutely 
appalling and we will pay for it.

41
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,670
So unless we wake up and hopefully we'll
wake up because that would be better 

42
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,601
than paying for it.
Even though being awake is rather 

43
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:08,601
painful.
