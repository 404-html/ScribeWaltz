1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,430
And they heard the voice of the Lord God
walking in the garden in the cool of the

2
00:00:03,431 --> 00:00:08,431
day,
and Adam and his wife hid themselves 

3
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:08,431
from the presence of the Lord God 
amongst the trees of the garden.

4
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:11,560
That's interesting.
So what's the implication?

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:17,070
Priority being woken up prior to 
recognizing nakedness and vulnerability.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,890
There is no reason for God,
for man and woman to hide from God now 

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,410
where they're hurting from God while 
they're naked,

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,360
they're vulnerable.
Okay,

9
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,400
so think about this.
Think about this.

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,430
It's like imagine that you have the 
capacity to live truthfully and 

11
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:37,591
courageously and forthrightly.
Just imagine that and then imagine why 

12
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:39,230
you might not do that.
And then imagined.

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,810
Well,
how about fear and shame?

14
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:42,010
How?
How would that work?

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,300
Well,
let's say that the idea of living 

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,401
forthright,
Lee and truthfully and courageously is 

17
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:53,551
analogous,
given what we already know about these 

18
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:55,621
stories to walking with God in the 
garden or what stops people from doing 

19
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:55,621
that?

20
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:56,440
What stops people from hiding?
Well,

21
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:58,990
it's their own rates and recognition of 
their own inadequacy.

22
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:03,220
They look at themselves and they think,
how in the world is a creature such as?

23
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:08,221
I supposed to live properly in this 
world with everything that's wrong with 

24
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,690
me,
and so what do you hide from?

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,390
Well,
you,

26
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,630
you go home,
you sit on your bed for five minutes and

27
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,790
ask yourself,
what have you hidden from in your life?

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Man,
you'll have books of knowledge reveal 

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
themselves to you in your imagination,
right?

30
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,520
Say,
well,

31
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:23,140
why are you hiding?
Well,

32
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:24,490
it's no bloody wonder.
You're hiding.

33
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,090
It's no wonder that people hide.
That's the thing that's so terrifying 

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,520
about this story.
We woke up and we thought,

35
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:35,521
oh my God,
look at this place like this is 

36
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:37,591
seriously.
There's some serious trouble here and 

37
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:37,591
we're in some serious trouble and we're 
not what we could be,

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,570
and so we hide and that's what the story
says.

39
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,580
People woke up,
they became self conscious.

40
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,340
They recognize their own vulnerability 
and that make the,

41
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,210
made them hide from manifesting their 
divine destiny.

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:49,900
It's like,
yeah,

43
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,890
that's exactly right,
and the Lord go there.

44
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,900
I love this part of the story and it's 
so funny and the Lord God called and we 

45
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,051
could use a little humor at this point,
and the Lord God called Unto Adam and 

46
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:03,940
said unto him where Art Thou?
And Adam said,

47
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,930
I heard a voice in the garden and I f I 
was afraid because I was naked.

48
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,890
So in case there was any doubt about 
that.

49
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:16,891
That's why.
And I hid myself and God said,

50
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,590
who told you that you were naked?
Did you eat of the tree whereof I 

51
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,501
commanded you that you should not eat.
And this is where Adam shows himself in 

52
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:35,360
all his post fall,
heroic glory.

53
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,870
And the man said,
the woman

54
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,430
who no gave us to be with me,
she gave me of the tree and I did eat.

55
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,460
So that set,
that set that it's so,

56
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,080
you know,
again,

57
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,380
there's a modern feminist interpretation
of the story of Adam and eve that makes 

58
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,181
the claim that eve was portrayed as the 
universal bad guy of humanity for 

59
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,580
disobeying God and eating the Apple.
It's like,

60
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,110
fair enough.
You know,

61
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,840
it looks like she slipped up and then 
she tempted her husband and you know,

62
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,450
that makes her even worse,
although he's was foolish enough to 

63
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,260
immediately eat,
so it just means she was a little more 

64
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:28,260
courageous than him then got there 
first,

65
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,840
but it's Adam who comes across as really
one sad creature in this story as far as

66
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,330
I'm concerned,
what he manages in one sentence.

67
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,220
It's like,
first of all,

68
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:38,300
it wasn't him.
It was the woman and said,

69
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,700
can even blames God.

70
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,000
It wasn't just the woman,
it was,

71
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,160
it was that woman and you gave her to me
and she gave me of the tree and I did 

72
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,280
eat.
It's like,

73
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,300
so hey,
Adam was all innocent except now he's 

74
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,820
not only is he naked and disobedient and
cowardly and ashamed.

75
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,950
He's also sniffily backbiting.
Think he writes her out like the second 

76
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,100
he gets the opportunity and then he 
blames God.

77
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,660
It's like,
and that's exactly right.

78
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,980
That's exactly right,
man.

79
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,100
You go online and you read,
you read the commentary that men write 

80
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,160
about women when they're resentful and 
bitter about women.

81
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,110
You read it.
It's so interesting.

82
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,520
It's like,
it's not me,

83
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,710
it's those bitches.
Okay.

84
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,270
That's right.
It's not me,

85
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,460
it's them.
And not only that,

86
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,070
what a bloody world this is in which 
they exist.

87
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,250
It's exactly the same thing.
It's exactly the same thing and it is 

88
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,380
absolutely pathetic.
All right.

89
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,570
Thank you.
