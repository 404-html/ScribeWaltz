1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,210
Our daughter entered her life at 24 due 
to depression.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,280
If someone is determined to end their 
life,

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,890
how can one change their mind?
Oh,

4
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:08,710
well,
first of all,

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,430
I'm very sorry about that.
That's a terrible thing.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,890
Look,
I had this friend her.

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,550
Sorry.
There's been a lot of depression in our 

8
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:43,161
family,
so it's a question that comes close to 

9
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:43,161
the bone.

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,950
Anyways,
I had this friend and friend of my 

11
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,180
parents and her grand daughter committed
suicide.

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,190
You know,
she was just beating yourself up about 

13
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:58,190
that.
What could have I done?

14
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,810
What could've I done differently?
This is the problem with suicide.

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,840
It leaves everybody behind thinking,
Oh my God,

16
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,480
what could have I done?
I could have treated the person better.

17
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:08,190
I could have listened.
I could have been there.

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,480
It's like,
and she was just beating yourself up 

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,550
about this really feeling that she 
wasn't a useful person,

20
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:17,340
that she'd failed as a grandmother.
She was a really good person,

21
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:22,341
you know,
and so I went for a walk with her and I 

22
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:24,891
said,
she's married and she likes her husband 

23
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:25,110
and he's a really good guy.
And I said,

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,930
look,
you're,

25
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,100
you're blaming yourself for the,
for your granddaughter,

26
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:32,890
suicide.
It's like,

27
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,940
are you blaming your husband?
Are you sitting him down and telling 

28
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,331
them what to use?
Useless bastard he was as a grandfather 

29
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:42,510
because his grand daughter committed 
suicide and how he failed completely.

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,860
She said,
no,

31
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:46,140
I'd never do that.
So I said,

32
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:50,490
well,
don't do it to yourself.

33
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,770
No people.
Depression was a terrible thing and 

34
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:58,800
many,
many,

35
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:01,200
many things cause it and we don't 
understand.

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,040
We understand some of them,
but lots of them we don't understand at 

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,040
all.
You know,

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,620
sometimes people get depressed because 
they're really sick.

39
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,460
We know that depression can be an 
inflammatory disease,

40
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:13,980
it might be associated with autoimmune 
dysfunction.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,510
There's lots of reasons that people get 
depressed and depressed.

42
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:21,030
People can go places that are so dark,
you just cannot imagine it.

43
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,380
And it isn't necessarily the case that 
you can always rescue someone,

44
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:26,730
you know,
and,

45
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,940
but,
but drowning yourself in the aftermath 

46
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,510
of a suicide is not helpful.
So there's a,

47
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,830
there's a good room for self forgiveness
there.

48
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:39,831
You know,
I mean maybe you did some things you 

49
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:39,831
shouldn't have done that were 
reprehensible and all of that,

50
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:44,130
but you don't want to beat yourself up.
Remember the presumption of innocence,

51
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:49,131
right?
Innocent until proven guilty and you 

52
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:50,370
have to apply that to yourself.
I don't think.

53
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,270
I think there are times when people are 
so depressed there.

54
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,200
There isn't anything that anyone can do.
You know,

55
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,230
when the depressed person thinks,
and this is probably the worst part of 

56
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,850
it,
the depressed person thinks

57
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,030
everywhere I look,
it's nothing but catastrophe and 

58
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,550
there's.
I can't see any way out of it.

59
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:18,210
I can't see any path forward whatsoever.
And then they think as well and maybe 

60
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,720
it's the combination of these two 
thoughts that,

61
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,930
that really make people suicidal so like
it's hopeless.

62
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,190
It isn't going to get any better no 
matter where I turned.

63
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:31,191
There's no escape.
The suffering is unbearable and I've 

64
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:32,470
absolutely no use whatsoever.
Do anyone.

65
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,190
It would be better for everyone if I was
just gone because I'm going,

66
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,060
if I'm not so much of a burden now that 
it's going to destroy their life,

67
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:44,140
then I'm going to be that much of a 
burden in the future,

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,430
and so todd,
you imagine what that's like for people,

69
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:53,431
but it's dreadful and there's lots of 
ways you get there and so you can listen

70
00:03:55,481 --> 00:04:00,481
to people.
You can desperately encourage them to 

71
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:00,481
seek the help they need.

72
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:00,750
You know,
like I've,

73
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,430
I've seen antidepressants work miracles 
on very,

74
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:06,340
very many people now.
They don't work for everyone and they're

75
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:10,600
not a panacea but they have side effects
and all of that,

76
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:14,590
but one of the side effects of untreated
depression is that you kill yourself and

77
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:19,450
there is no recovery from that and are 
the probabilities actually rather high.

78
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,070
So you can go to war with them about 
antidepressants.

79
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:27,400
If the person can't get out of their 
depression and their and their suicidal.

80
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:32,401
It's like,
what do they have to lose one month on 

81
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:32,401
antidepressants?
They'll know,

82
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,790
oh,
they might have to experiment longer 

83
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:37,790
because it would depend on,
you know,

84
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,710
some people respond better to some 
classes of antidepressants than the 

85
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,710
others.
Um,

86
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,990
it's worth having a war with someone if 
they're in dire straits and they won't 

87
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,070
do everything they can to get better.
ECT works.

88
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:50,740
Electric convulsive therapy works for 
intractable depression.

89
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,970
It's a terrible thing to contemplate.
But the modern versions of ect aren't.

90
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,310
One flew over the cuckoo's nest.
And again,

91
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:59,830
it's like there's no coming back from 
death.

92
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,210
So look,
it isn't clean.

93
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,660
You can't rescue everyone.
People get sick and they die,

94
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,250
and sometimes the way they die looks 
like it's depression.

95
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,810
Depression is a multifaceted phenomena.
You can be there for them.

96
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,510
You can listen,
you can watch,

97
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,650
you can intervene,
you can try to understand,

98
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,610
you can hold them accountable.
You can do all of those things but that,

99
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,070
but everyone has their own destiny,
you know,

100
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,160
and you're not omnipotent.
And so sometimes a catastrophe will 

101
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:40,220
curse like your daughters and

102
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:48,050
then,
and then you should try to drag the 

103
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,321
least amount of misery forward that you 
can once you recover from your grief.

104
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:56,980
Yep.
