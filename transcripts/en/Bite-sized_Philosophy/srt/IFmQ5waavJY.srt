1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,980
Your attention,
for example,

2
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:06,981
is mediated by unconscious forces and 
you know that you know that perfectly 

3
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:08,370
well and this is another Freud and 
observation.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,660
You know if you're sitting down to 
study,

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,990
for example,
your conscious intent is to study,

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,430
but you know perfectly well that all 
sorts of distraction fantasies are going

7
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:25,431
to enter the theater of your imagination
nonstop and annoyingly and there isn't 

8
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:27,690
really a lot you can do about that 
except maybe wait it out.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,050
You know,
so you'll be sitting there reading and 

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,660
your attention will flicker away.
You'll think about maybe you want to 

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,540
watch Jane the Virgin on Netflix or 
something like that,

12
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:41,541
or maybe it's time to have a peanut 
butter sandwich or you should get the 

13
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,421
dust bunnies from out from underneath 
the bed or it's time to go outside and 

14
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:48,021
have a cigarette or maybe it's time for 
a cup of coffee or it's like all these 

15
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:51,861
subsystems in you that would like 
something aren't very happy just to sit 

16
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:55,440
there while you read this thing that 
you're actually bored by and so they pop

17
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:59,040
up and try to take control of your 
perceptions and your actions nonstop.

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,560
Maybe you think,
well this is a stupid course anyways,

19
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,830
why do I have to read this damn paper 
and what am I doing in university?

20
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,590
And what's the point of life?
It's like you can really.

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,950
Well,
you can really get going if you're 

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,950
trying to avoid doing your homework and,
and,

23
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,620
and then you might think,
well,

24
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:15,750
what is it in you that's trying to 
avoid?

25
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:20,751
Because after all you took the damn 
course and you told yourself to sit 

26
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:26,031
down.
Why don't you listen well because 

27
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:26,160
you're,
you're a mess.

28
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,810
And that's basically why you haven't got
control over yourself at all.

29
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,350
And no more than I have control over 
this laptop.

30
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,700
Okay?
So there's the memory function of,

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,260
of,
of the unconscious,

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,950
and there's the disillusion of function.
That's an interesting one.

33
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,100
The unconscious contains habits once 
voluntary,

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,280
now automatized and dissociated elements
of the personality which may lead a 

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,240
parasitic existence.
That's an interesting one.

36
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,700
I would relate that more to procedural 
memory.

37
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,370
You know,
so what you've done is practiced certain

38
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:00,930
habits,
whatever they might be,

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,020
let's call them bad habits.
And you like those things to get under 

40
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,020
control,
but you can't.

41
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,200
So maybe when you're speaking for 
example,

42
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,410
you use like and you know and you say 
I'm a lot and you've practiced that so 

43
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,250
you're really good at it and you'd like 
to stop it,

44
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:19,251
but you don't get to because you've 
built that little machine right into 

45
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:19,260
your being,
right.

46
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:23,910
It's neurologically wired and it's not 
under conscious control and anything you

47
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:27,450
practice becomes that it becomes part of
you.

48
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,520
And that's another element of the 
unconscious,

49
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:34,521
a different part.
And then there's a creative part which 

50
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:34,521
is that,
well,

51
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:38,661
you know,
you're sitting around and maybe you're 

52
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:40,641
trying to write something or maybe you 
want to produce a piece of art or a 

53
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:44,901
piece of music,
or maybe you're just laying in bed 

54
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:44,901
dreaming and you have all these weird 
ideas.

55
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:49,581
And especially in dreams,
it's like what were those things come 

56
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:49,800
from?
And even more strange,

57
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,170
one of the things that's really weird 
about dreams and almost impossibly weird

58
00:02:55,171 --> 00:03:00,171
is that you're an observer in the dream.
It's like a dream is something that 

59
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:00,171
happens to you.
Well,

60
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:04,980
you're dreaming it theoretically.
So how is it that you can be an 

61
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,760
observer?
It's almost like you're watching a video

62
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,880
game or a movie,
but you're producing it that at least in

63
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,520
principle,
although the psychoanalyst would say,

64
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:12,940
well,
no,

65
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:13,600
not exactly.

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,300
Your ego isn't producing it.
Your unconscious as producing,

67
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,460
it's a different thing.
It's a different thing,

68
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:19,630
and of course young would say,
well,

69
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:24,631
it's deeper than that.
The collective unconscious might be 

70
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:26,851
producing it.
It's in some sense it isn't you exactly 

71
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:28,390
or it isn't the you that you think of 
when you think of you,

72
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,760
and that's the ego from the Friday and 
perspective,

73
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:35,761
the you that you identify with,
that's the ego and outside of that is 

74
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:39,841
the unconscious,
the ID that's more of the place of 

75
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:43,051
impulses and you could think about those
as the biological subsystems that can 

76
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:43,540
derail your thinking.
Right?

77
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:48,541
And that govern things like hunger and 
sex and aggression and your basic 

78
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:52,500
instincts is another way of putting it 
and it's a reasonable way of thinking 

79
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,250
about it because these are subsystems 
that you share with with animals.

80
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,900
You share them.
Certainly with mammals.

81
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,900
You share most of them with reptiles.
You share a lot of them with amphibians 

82
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,170
and even going all the way down to 
crustaceans.

83
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:07,171
There's commonality,
for example in the dominance hierarchy 

84
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:08,800
circuits and so these are very,
very old things and the idea that you're

85
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:13,090
in control of them is,
well,

86
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,450
you're not exactly in control of them 
and I would say the less integrated you 

87
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,531
are,
the less you're in control of them and 

88
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:24,280
the more they're in control of you and 
that can get really out of hand.

89
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,340
You know,
you can be like with people who have 

90
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:29,770
obsessive compulsive disorder,
for example,

91
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,790
which,
which,

92
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,710
which is,
which seems to be,

93
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,370
I would say that dissoluted elements in 
some sense of the unconscious,

94
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,400
the way that it's portrayed here.
Poor people with obsessive compulsive 

95
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,061
disorder.
They can spend half their time doing 

96
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:45,910
things that they can't really control 
and they have very strong impulses to do

97
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,120
that.

98
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,530
And it's very hard on them to block them
in.

99
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,920
Nowadays.
They'll almost panic if those things are

100
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:55,921
blocked.
And then you have people with two Rett 

101
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:55,921
Syndrome,
you know,

102
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,411
that they'll be doing all sorts of weird
dances and spouting off obscenities and,

103
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,330
and,
and,

104
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,880
and imitating people without being able 
to control it.

105
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:08,881
And,
and sometimes a little bit of anti 

106
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:08,881
psychotic medication can dampen that 
down.

107
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:13,651
But it's as if there are these 
autonomous semi spirits inside of them 

108
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:15,970
that grip control over their behavior 
and make them do things.

109
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:18,730
And you know,
you find that to some degree in your own

110
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:22,090
life because maybe you've become very 
attracted to someone even.

111
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:24,130
Maybe you don't want to be attracted to 
the person.

112
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:29,131
And then you find yourself texting them 
when you know perfectly well that you 

113
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:29,920
should be going to bed and you know,
you're,

114
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,710
you're in a grip of something and you 
can't control it.

115
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:36,010
And that's all part of the unconscious 
and all part of what Freud was studying.
