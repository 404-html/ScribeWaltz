1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,100
Okay,
all right.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,440
What the hell address the Jewish 
question?

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,280
That's a hell of a thing to ask.
So that's Jacqueline.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,470
You know,
I mean really that's a hell of a thing 

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,470
to ask,
but I will say something about it.

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,010
You know,
and I thought about this a lot.

7
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:17,340
So there is evidence that Ashkenazi 
Jews,

8
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:21,630
so those are Jews of European heritage,
have iqs that are about 15 points higher

9
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:23,700
than the population average.
So that's a lot.

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,730
15 points.
It's about the average difference 

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,070
between the typical high school student 
and the typical state college student.

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,220
It's a lot.
And one of the things that means is,

13
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:37,221
so imagine there's two distributions and
that they overlap and that the Jewish 

14
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:37,221
one is,
uh,

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,560
is the mean is 1:15.
So the whole distribution has shifted to

16
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:45,480
the right.
What that means is if you go up into the

17
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:47,760
Higher Iq strata,
1:30,

18
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:49,770
1:45
way the hell up there,

19
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,010
that Jewish people are overwhelmingly 
overrepresented at the high end of the 

20
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,010
ICU distribution.

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,140
Now the price they pay for that is some 
increased propensity for neurological 

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,910
diseases that seems to be associated in 
some sense with that heightened Iq.

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,760
Now you know,
the science on this isn't settled but,

24
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,390
but it,
it's reasonably solid.

25
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,260
It given the standards of such things.
Okay,

26
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:18,261
so Jews are going to be our over 
represented at the high end of 

27
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:20,850
cognitively complex disciplines.
So then I would say,

28
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,290
and that's the case,
like they're way over represented among 

29
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,140
like outstanding scientists and among 
Nobel Prize winners and and so forth.

30
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,810
And so you know,
people look and they think,

31
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:35,811
well why are there a disproportionate 
number of Jewish people in positions of 

32
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:35,811
authority?
And they say,

33
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:37,500
well,
it must be a conspiracy.

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,530
You know,
it must be systemic in some sense.

35
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:41,250
It's like,
no,

36
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,630
it can be simply accounted for by that 
relatively large ICU differential.

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,510
Now the next criticism would be,
well,

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,060
don't the Jews tend to lean left?

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,800
Well first you might say,
well,

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,920
you know,
given what happened in Nazi Germany to 

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,070
the degree that that was right wing as 
we discussed earlier,

42
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:01,020
that's the nationalism and 
ethnocentrism.

43
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,960
It's hardly surprising that they might,
you know,

44
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:07,680
in this historical period of time tend 
to move towards the left,

45
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,030
but more importantly than that,
Iq is associated with trait,

46
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,720
openness and trade.
Openness is a strong predictor predictor

47
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:18,180
of political liberalism.
So,

48
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,090
and it's the strongest predictor of 
political liberalism.

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,590
So,
you know,

50
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,520
it's very difficult.
So that's what I have to say about that.

51
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,200
It's like,
and the other thing I would say is,

52
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,740
you know,
the fact that there is a population of 

53
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,430
subpopulation of people who are much 
smarter than average,

54
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,930
not on average,
right?

55
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,590
On average,
I've got to get that straight on average

56
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:45,591
is actually a great benefit to the rest 
of us because why do you want fewer 

57
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:49,230
geniuses?
Fewer people with Iqs of 145 or 160.

58
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,470
That's and you know,
and it's no conspiracy that puts people 

59
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,941
who are smarter,
higher up in competence hierarchies 

60
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:02,091
because I accused the best predictor of 
movement in a complex carb competence 

61
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:03,070
hierarchy.
So there,

62
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:08,071
I've addressed the Jewish question.
It's like it's a confusion between 

63
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:10,480
ethnicity and and ICU as far as I'm 
concerned.

64
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,570
So I'll probably get like painted six 
different shades of black for that 

65
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:15,790
answer,
but it's.

66
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,850
I've thought about a long time.
It's the best that I can manage.
