1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,270
So I've noticed when I've lived in 
places rented or owned,

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,270
didn't matter then if there were part of
the place,

3
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:11,270
if there was a part of the place that I 
hadn't attended to,

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,910
whatever that might mean,
it might meant cleaned.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,510
It might've meant fixed,
but it certainly meant at least 

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,210
thoroughly investigated.
Then that was chaos.

7
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:22,700
It was like it was.
It was like the desert.

8
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:24,530
That part that's,
that's a way of thinking about it.

9
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:26,630
It wasn't mine.
Even if I owned it wasn't mine.

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,840
I had to interact with it before it 
became mine and I had to interact with 

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,190
it and I had to put it in order and then
it became mine and then.

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,160
And then to the degree that it became 
mine and was in order,

13
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:42,161
then I was also put an order.
Now you know that because you go into 

14
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:44,720
places that make you uncomfortable and 
maybe it's your own house,

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,160
it's highly probable.

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,750
It's highly probable.
I,

17
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:48,830
you know,
I walked into.

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,860
Well Chinese doctors do this.
Traditional Chinese doctors,

19
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:56,861
they go into place people's place and 
they diagnosed their health conditions 

20
00:00:56,861 --> 00:00:58,940
on the,
on the balance of Yin and Yang chaos and

21
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:01,550
order.
They walk into a house that this is easy

22
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:02,780
to do.
You walk into a house,

23
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,580
there's too much chaos.
Hey,

24
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:09,200
you can detect that in no time flat.
Everything is out of order and chaotic.

25
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:14,201
You don't even want to be there.
You certainly don't want to open the 

26
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:14,201
refrigerator.
That's for sure,

27
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:16,040
and there are things that should've been
done years ago,

28
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:21,041
everywhere and every one of those things
is a fight that hasn't happened and 

29
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:25,061
something that's been avoided and you 
can't even walk in there and maintain 

30
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:25,061
your health.
As soon as you walk in there,

31
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:29,861
you're sicker than you were when you 
were outside and that's one sort of 

32
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:29,861
place.

33
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:33,640
And then another sort of places you go 
in and you look at the living room and 

34
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,340
the person has vacuum.
The living room rug and the lines that 

35
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:44,501
were vacuumed are parallel to one 
another and the and the furniture is 

36
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:49,301
covered with plastic and you get a glass
of water and then just as you're going 

37
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:53,141
to set it down on the coffee table,
the person rushes over and puts a 

38
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:56,141
coaster underneath it and everything in 
that house says to you that it would be 

39
00:01:56,141 --> 00:02:00,260
a lot more perfect in that house if you 
were either not there or dead and that's

40
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,040
and that's the message that the whole 
house is blasting at you.

41
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,220
And if you happen to live there,
then you're going to be sick and what 

42
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,761
you're going to be sick from is too much
order and in the other house you're 

43
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:16,750
going to be sick from too much chaos.
And so when you interact with a house,

44
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,340
the unexplored parts are the chaos that 
that parts that you have not yet 

45
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,361
contended with are the chaos that has 
not yet been transformed by your 

46
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,510
embodied logos.
Action into habitable territory.

47
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,700
And it does not belong to you.
