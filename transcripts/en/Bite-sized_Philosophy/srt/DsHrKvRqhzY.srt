1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,560
What's my advice to young men seeking a 
woman for marriage and family?

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,200
Yeah.
Well,

3
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:08,010
okay,
fine.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,260
That's the same question.
Second question.

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,120
That's,
that's pretty straightforward man.

6
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:17,121
I mean,
you can't eliminate the necessity of 

7
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:17,910
being attracted to one another.
That's important.

8
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:19,890
And that's mysterious,
you know?

9
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:21,210
Um,
so for example,

10
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:23,520
here's a funny thing,
if you,

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,970
one of the things we know that attracts 
people to one another is bilateral 

12
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,001
symmetry.
And so if you take men and you ranked 

13
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:36,261
them by the symmetry of their faces and 
then you give the asymmetrical men tee 

14
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:43,101
shirts to wear clean t shirts for a day 
and the symmetrical men clean t shirts 

15
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:47,661
to wear for a day.
And then you give the t shirts to women 

16
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:47,670
and you have them rate the,
the odor,

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,270
the women rate the odor of the 
symmetrical men as more attractive than 

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,540
the odor of the asymmetrical man.

19
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,050
And then there were other factors that 
determined sexual attractiveness that 

20
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:05,241
are based on biological factors that are
so that deeply embedded in terms of 

21
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:05,310
smell,
for example.

22
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:09,580
So a women also tend to,
uh,

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,280
not be sexually attracted to the,
to the scent of men whose,

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,230
who have,
if I remember correctly,

25
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:21,231
it's rh factors that would make for 
potential trouble in childbirth.

26
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,410
And the often the reason that the women 
give for not preferring the scent of 

27
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,610
those men is that they smell too much 
like their brother,

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,250
something like that.
So there was weird,

29
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:37,251
mysterious things that determine whether
or not people are sexually and 

30
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:40,251
physically attracted to each other.
And I think it's very important that 

31
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:43,071
that's part of a marital relationship.
The next most important thing is trust.

32
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,660
Man.
It's like there,

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,290
there's no marriage that's successful 
without trust you guys.

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,820
You got to tell each other the truth.

35
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,950
And one of the reasons that you'll 
believe that marriage as a,

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,100
an oath and uh,
Carl Jung as a bond was necessary.

37
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:00,570
It's really wise.
It's like,

38
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,870
you know,
telling the truth to someone is no 

39
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,930
simple thing because there's a bunch of 
things about all of us that are terrible

40
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:10,140
and weak and reprehensible and shameful 
and all of those things.

41
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:15,141
And they kind of have to be brought out 
into the open and dealt with and you're 

42
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:19,611
not going to tell the truth about 
yourself to someone who can run away 

43
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:22,821
screaming when you reveal who you are.
And so the marriage bond is something 

44
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:23,670
like,
okay,

45
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,700
here's the deal,
I'm going to handcuff myself to you and 

46
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,321
you're going to handcuff yourself to me,
and then we're going to tell each other 

47
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,410
the truth and neither of us are going to
get to run away.

48
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,900
And so our,
once we know the truth,

49
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:41,901
then we're either going to live together
in mutual tournament or we're going to 

50
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:44,691
try to deal with that truth and 
straighten ourselves out and straighten 

51
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:44,691
ourselves out jointly.

52
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:49,370
And that's gonna make us more powerful 
and more resilient and more and deeper 

53
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:53,220
and wiser as we progress together 
through life.

54
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,590
And,
and I think that's absolutely brilliant 

55
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:58,590
because if you leave the backdoor open,
man,

56
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:58,950
you're going to use it.
That's for sure.

57
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,170
And the oath is there.
And this was [inaudible] commentary on 

58
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,561
the spiritualization of,
of the human pair and by Christian 

59
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:08,620
marriage,
for example,

60
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,310
which emphasized,
uh,

61
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,100
the,
the,

62
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,640
what would you call it,
the subordination of both members of the

63
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:20,641
marital union to a higher order,
a personality that was embodied in the 

64
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:24,690
figure of the logos.
So the idea is that in,

65
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,130
in,
in,

66
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,040
in the Christian marriage,
for example,

67
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,460
the man isn't the boss and the woman 
isn't the boss.

68
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,610
The boss is the mutual personality 
composed by the seeking of truth in both

69
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:39,430
of them.
And that's conceptualized as their,

70
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,650
their joint subjugation to the logos.

71
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,650
And that is absolutely dead on man.
It's like the ruler of your marital life

72
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:51,991
should be your vow to tell each other 
the truth because like in hard times 

73
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:57,301
during your life,
when you've done something stupid and 

74
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:58,750
idiotic might take you down and you 
don't have anybody that you can turn to.

75
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,780
You know,
if you have a partner that you can 

76
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:03,780
trust,
you can go say,

77
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:03,780
hey,
you know,

78
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,440
I made a big financial mistake man.
And it's really torturing me and I feel 

79
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,220
like a complete idiot.
And it's really dangerous and the person

80
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:14,221
there,
it's going to help you figure out what 

81
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:14,710
to do about it and they're going to know
that when they make a stupid mistake and

82
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:19,711
they're bloody well going to,
that they can come and talk to you and 

83
00:04:19,711 --> 00:04:22,350
that you guys are going to work your way
through it and that's a big deal and 

84
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,360
there's a couple of things our culture 
gets really wrong and one is it devalues

85
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:25,900
marriage.

86
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,990
That's really a very bad idea because 
marriages,

87
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,380
marriages like a third of your life and 
maybe more and kids are a third of your 

88
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,860
life and your,
your,

89
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,550
your life outside of marriage and kids 
is a third of your life.

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You know,
approximately speaking and to miss any 

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,270
of that is a massive,
massive mistake.

92
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,730
Now,
having said that,

93
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,970
I will also say that for some people,
missing one or more of those is 

94
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,620
necessary because they have a reason.
Maybe they're brilliantly creative 

95
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,271
artists and they need to devote 
themselves entirely to their career or 

96
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:03,570
they're outstanding in some way and so 
they need.

97
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,610
They can justify the sacrifice of one 
part of that tryout of being to another 

98
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,460
part,
but for,

99
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,730
but generally speaking,
it's a very dangerous thing and it,

100
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,990
it,
it shouldn't be done.

101
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,140
And also kids get an absolutely terrible
rap,

102
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,810
you know,
because kids are delightful.

103
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,960
If they're well behaved.
One of the chapters in my new book is 

104
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,680
called don't let your children do 
anything that makes you dislike them and

105
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,710
you can do that,
especially if you discuss it thoroughly 

106
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,531
with your spouse.
You're the person that's helping you 

107
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:37,141
discipline the kids and children are the
best company because they're really 

108
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:39,490
enthusiastic about everything.
They love doing new things.

109
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,340
They really love you.
So they're happy that you're around.

110
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,940
Um,
all you have to do is make sure they're 

111
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,310
not too hot and they're not too cold and
they've had something to eat and they're

112
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:53,311
not too tired and you don't expect them 
to stay engaged in something for longer 

113
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:59,101
than they can manage because we used to 
take our kids when they were little out 

114
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:01,921
to for example,
and they could sit there no problem and 

115
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:01,921
behave really nicely when they were two 
and three.

116
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:04,430
But they couldn't do it for more than 
about 45 minutes.

117
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,580
He can't push your luck.
But I also noticed with little kids is 

118
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,971
that they got antsy and unreasonable 
about five to 10 minutes before the 

119
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:17,771
adults did too.
It's just the adults were too stupid to 

120
00:06:17,771 --> 00:06:17,771
notice.
The kids would notice right away.

121
00:06:17,771 --> 00:06:18,200
So,
um,

122
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,680
so back to marriage,
when you look for someone that you're 

123
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:23,680
attracted to,
that you love,

124
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,410
and then you look for someone that you 
can bloody well,

125
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:27,420
trust,
and then you tell them the truth and,

126
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,640
and that way maybe you can get through 
life and you can have someone to weave 

127
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,720
the rope of your being with and together
to make,

128
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,810
to make your joint ropes stronger and 
you can have some continuity in your 

129
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,770
narrative and you can have children and 
then you can have grandchildren and like

130
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:45,320
you can have a life man and there's 
nothing.

131
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,110
You're so fortunate if you can manage 
that.

132
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:49,700
And so.
Okay.

133
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,270
So there's that one.
So what's my advice to young men seeking

134
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:55,130
a woman for marriage and family?
Yeah.

135
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,260
Well,
and also,

136
00:06:57,261 --> 00:07:02,261
you know,
marry someone you think would be a good 

137
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:02,261
mother and that has enough sense 
generally speaking,

138
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:03,860
to know that she wants children.
Now,

139
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,920
some women don't want children and fair 
enough and some women perhaps shouldn't 

140
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,210
have children.
That's also possible,

141
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,240
but the general rule of thumb is 
especially once a woman in her mid 

142
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,520
twenties,
if she doesn't know that she wants 

143
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,371
children or wounded admitted,
unless she has a viciously important 

144
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:28,760
reason,
then she's not oriented properly.

145
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:30,140
Psychologically she,
she,

146
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:35,170
she isn't.
She doesn't know what's important in 

147
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:35,170
life.
Now,

148
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,230
that might also be the case with you and
it probably is,

149
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,390
but as a rule of thumb,
that's a really good one.
