1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,370
So what happens?
Well,

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:05,160
Kane makes his offerings and God isn't 
happy with them.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,630
Now we don't know how cain figures out 
that God isn't happy with his offerings.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,990
We get some hints of that too.
But the story does tell us that's what 

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,501
happens.
And so then we get the psychological 

6
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:19,380
response on the part of cane.
Now one response could be,

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,300
Jesus,
I must be doing something wrong.

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,580
I better straighten myself out,
you know,

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,850
I better come up with a better quality 
offering and try that again.

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,510
That isn't what happens.
What happens instead is that cane 

11
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,480
becomes angry wroth and his countenance 
fault.

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,670
And so what does that mean?
It means this,

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,710
right?
It means he is not happy.

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,480
He's angry and out for revenge.
And so one of the.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,440
I've been thinking about this a lot 
lately with regards to the literature on

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,530
inequality,
because there's a very good literature 

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:51,530
that shows,
for example,

18
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:51,750
that there's a,
there's a,

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,550
there's a measure called the Gini 
Coefficient.

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,970
The Gini Coefficient is a numerical 
index of the relative inequality of a 

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,540
geographical locale.
So for example,

22
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:05,541
if you went to Newfoundland where 
everyone is roughly not very rich or 

23
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:09,021
North Dakota,
say almost everyone there is say lower 

24
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:09,180
middle class,
something like that,

25
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:10,920
or upper working class,
something like that.

26
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,130
Very little variability,
low Gini Coefficient,

27
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,680
okay?
And if you go to Miami Beach,

28
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:19,230
say where everyone's rich,
low gini coefficient,

29
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,550
because it isn't an index of absolute 
wealth or absolute poverty,

30
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:27,060
it's an index of relative poverty.
And so if everyone's rich,

31
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:29,400
the relative poverty is low,
and if everyone's poor,

32
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,510
the relative poverty is low.
Now one question is where's the crime?

33
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,210
And you might think,
well,

34
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:39,870
the crime is where the absolute poverty 
is high,

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,310
right?
Or the absolute wealth is low.

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,710
That's where the crime is.
That's wrong.

37
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,820
If it's.
If things are relatively distributed in 

38
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,750
an egalitarian manner,
the male on male crime,

39
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,860
especially homicide is low and it's also
the case where everyone is rich.

40
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,240
But if you go into places where there's 
some rich people but not very many,

41
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,330
and there's a lot of people who are 
comparatively poor than the male 

42
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,680
homicide rapes rates and violent crime 
rates amp up substantially.

43
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,050
And it's a consequence of male on male 
competition,

44
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,530
and so what you could derive from that 
and maybe even reasonably is that you 

45
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,851
should flatten out the damn income into 
distribution because you're 

46
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:22,110
destabilizing this society by 
facilitating male criminal aggression.

47
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,270
You can make a good case for that.
You know,

48
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:29,271
in,
in places like Columbia where the Gini 

49
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:32,240
Coefficient got unbelievably extreme,
society got so violent that it could 

50
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,880
barely hold itself together.
So,

51
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,180
so you,
you can make a conservative argument for

52
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:41,181
redistribution of income using the 
observation that if the income 

53
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:44,691
distribution gets too extreme,
the whole bloody thing starts to 

54
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:44,691
destabilize.
It might fall,

55
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:46,260
but,
but then you also might say,

56
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,530
wait a minute,
is it any quality that's driving the 

57
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,660
violence or is it resentment of the 
inequality that's driving the violence?

58
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,620
Now,
that's a tough question because you 

59
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:00,620
might say,
well,

60
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,270
what if the game is rigged and there's 
no way of moving up the power hierarchy?

61
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,710
Well then maybe anger and the desire for
revolution is the appropriate response.

62
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:10,711
But that doesn't really mean to me that 
the response should be that sort of 

63
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:13,180
thing that you see in hygienic 
coefficient neighborhoods,

64
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:17,800
which is interracial,
intra racial violence between men.

65
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,730
So for example,
in neighborhoods where there's high 

66
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,460
murder rates,
the murders are always between young men

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and they're always within race.
And so that doesn't seem to me to be 

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,640
exactly a politically revolutionary 
move,

69
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:35,641
right?
It's more like it's more like a violent 

70
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:35,800
competition for the sake of,
of,

71
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,050
of attaining status.
And you might say,

72
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:43,051
well that's reasonable,
but because the inequality is there and 

73
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:44,530
then need to find status because it's 
part of what drives them forward.

74
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,180
It's part of what makes them attractive 
to women.

75
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,280
It's a necessity.
Well,

76
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:50,800
the question is,
do you attain status through destruction

77
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,430
or do you start making your offerings,
putting your offerings in order?

78
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,700
And that's something we really need to 
figure out because that's a fundamental 

79
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,100
political question.
It's a fundamental political question.

80
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,670
Anyways.
What happens in this story is that cane 

81
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,281
decides that the fact that God isn't 
accepting his offerings means that he's 

82
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,170
entitled to become angry and,
and,

83
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,320
and negative.
Those two things or both put together 

84
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,320
right?
He's raw,

85
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,910
he's angry,
and he's also depressed and so he's in a

86
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:20,140
state of mind that,
well,

87
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:25,141
I think the best characterization for 
that as hostile resentment because it's 

88
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:25,780
unfair.
It's like,

89
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,830
yeah,
it's unfair,

90
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,280
so we're going to do about it.
Can you get destructive about it?

91
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,560
Are going to change your approach?
Well,

92
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:37,561
Kane,
he does the ultimate thing and this is 

93
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:39,421
what people do when they do the ultimate
thing because that kind of hostile 

94
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:43,480
resentment has an architectural end 
point and the architectural end point is

95
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:48,481
the point that you get when you're 
hostile and resentful because you 

96
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:51,451
haven't been successful and then you go 
sit in your mother's basement for about 

97
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:53,620
10 years and then you start imagining 
just how nice it would be if you shut up

98
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:58,621
the local high school so that everybody 
knew your name and what happens is you 

99
00:04:58,621 --> 00:05:01,570
go from I'm irritated because things 
aren't working out for me very well too.

100
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,980
I'm irritated.
Nine and a hate.

101
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:06,160
Those people for whom things are working
out well too.

102
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,340
I'm irritated and I hate the fact that 
the world is set up so that this has 

103
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,001
happened to me and then you go to well 
because I'm irritated and hate the 

104
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:15,370
world.
I'm going to do whatever I can that will

105
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:20,050
destroy it most rapidly and with the,
with the highest possible amount of pain

106
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:25,051
and suffering conceivable and at that 
point then you don't just go shoot up 

107
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:29,491
the high school.
You go up and shoot up the elementary 

108
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:31,561
school and so if you're wondering what 
kind of pathway people walk down to get 

109
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:35,881
to that point,
that's the pathway and the ultimate cap 

110
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:35,881
of that as well.
I'll,

111
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:36,100
I'll,
I'll,

112
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,220
I'll kill the kids because well we 
already know that killing the innocent 

113
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:41,500
is a lot more effective than killing the
guilty.

114
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,170
And then just to cap it off,
I'll blow my head off at the end just to

115
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:46,450
show you just how God damn pointless it 
all is.

116
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,370
And so that's the logical extension of 
keynes attitude and you might think,

117
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:54,460
well that's a bit of an overeating and I
will say it's not an overriding and all.

118
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,830
It's exactly what happens in the text.
So it's,

119
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:59,060
it's exactly what follows it.
So foreign.

120
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,540
So Kane is not happy.
And so who was he not happy with?

121
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,170
Well,
he's not happy with God.

122
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,240
And so what does that mean?
Well,

123
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,300
we've already unpacked this.
He's not happy with the social contract 

124
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,660
because that's part of the spirit,
the patriarchal spirit,

125
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:19,661
let's say.
Then there's more to it than that 

126
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:20,570
because we already,
we've already analyzed what God,

127
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:23,090
the idea of God might represent in the 
background of this story.

128
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,210
He's not happy with the transcendent.
He's not happy with the idea of the 

129
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:28,210
logos,
all of that.

130
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,580
No faith in the transcendent,
nothing but he does nothing but despise 

131
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:38,591
the social contract.
And he's got no faith whatsoever in the 

132
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,800
logos.
Let's say the word that brings chaos out

133
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:42,170
of order.
He's got nothing but contempt for all of

134
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,550
that.
And you know,

135
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,990
certainly,
you know,

136
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,910
people like that.
And if you don't know them,

137
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:51,911
you just go on youtube and read the 
comments and you'll see all sorts of 

138
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:51,911
people like that.
So.
