1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,920
Now you've got these two evil creatures 
here at Fox and the cat.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,370
I think this one's based on one of the 
Marx brothers,

3
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:10,080
actually Harpo Marx,
who I believe,

4
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:13,410
never said anything but be that as it 
may,

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,670
there are these Ne'er do well characters
on the Fox in particular.

6
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:19,200
Now Fox is a standard trickster animal,
right?

7
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:21,000
It's a,
it's a,

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,320
it's,
it's,

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,830
it's a classic animal.
Maybe because it's,

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,180
it's good at hiding and it's good at 
hunting.

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,900
I don't know exactly why,
but it's an coyotes are like that too.

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,960
They're classic trickster animals.
Um,

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,300
he's Kinda like Wiley Coyote,
in fact,

14
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:37,330
you know,
the,

15
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,390
the warner brothers character who's a 
genius at large and of course whose 

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,100
arrogance continually gets him walloped 
and this character has a lot of features

17
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:47,940
like that,
but he,

18
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,950
he's,
he feigns being,

19
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:54,951
uh,
an English gentleman of like the 18 

20
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:54,951
nineties and pretends to be educated 
and,

21
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:55,590
and,
uh,

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,010
it has our kind of high blown way of 
talking and he's a fraud through and 

23
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:01,010
through.

24
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:01,260
And he's got,
he's got this,

25
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,290
you know,
sidekick who is barely there at all and 

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,000
he,
he doesn't treat him that well,

27
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,030
but he's got someone to Lord it over.
So that keeps his dominance hierarchy 

28
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,901
thing going well.
And the fact that he's like a second 

29
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:20,991
rate companion while he never really 
noticed is that although he'll treat 

30
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:21,840
them contemptuously whenever he gets the
chats.

31
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,430
So anyways,
they're walking down the street and uh,

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,310
the,
uh,

33
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,410
Fox is bragging about some crooked thing
that he's done and how he pulled the 

34
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,401
wool over someone's eyes.
And he confuses that with a wisdom and 

35
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:38,451
intelligence.
And one of the things that you see this 

36
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:41,691
is worth knowing too,
because if you're preyed upon by a 

37
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:43,470
psychopath,
which you will be to some degree at some

38
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:48,471
point in your life,
the psychopath who will be narcissistic 

39
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:50,460
will presume that you're stupid and,
and,

40
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,550
and that you deserve to be taken 
advantage of because you're naive and 

41
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:55,550
stupid.

42
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:55,710
So it's actually a good thing that he's 
doing it.

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,820
And,
uh,

44
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,440
he,
his proof for,

45
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:00,990
and I'm saying he because there are more
male psychopaths,

46
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,870
um,
the,

47
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:08,871
uh,
the proof that you're stupid naive is 

48
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:09,300
that he can take advantage of you.
And so like if you were wiser you,

49
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,420
you'd be,
you know,

50
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,600
you'd,
you'd know his tricks and then it 

51
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,201
wouldn't be morally necessary for him to
show you just exactly who knows what 

52
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:22,341
about what.
And so the psychopath will use his 

53
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:25,830
ability to fool you as proof of his own 
grandiose,

54
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:29,220
grandiose omnipotence,
omniscience and narcissism.

55
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,580
And the problem with that is that you 
can be fooled by a psychopath and 

56
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,300
virtually anybody can.
So that Robert Hare,

57
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:41,301
for example,
who studied psychopaths for a long time 

58
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:43,680
and interviewed a lot of them,
like hundreds of them and videotape many

59
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:45,930
of the interviews he said when he was 
talking to the psychopath,

60
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:47,160
he always believed what they were 
saying.

61
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,160
And then he'd watched the video 
afterwards and see where the 

62
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,250
conversation went off the rails.
But you know,

63
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,210
the pro,
the proclivity to be polite in a 

64
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,670
conversation is very.
And if you're polite,

65
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:04,720
you don't object to the way that the 
person unfolds their strategy,

66
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:09,721
you know,
and psychopaths are pretty good at 

67
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:12,181
figuring out how to manipulate obviously
how to manipulate people and the 

68
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:14,650
probability that you will be immune to 
that is extraordinarily low.

69
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,250
Go Watch Paul Bernardo being interviewed
by policemen on,

70
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,620
on Youtube.
That's bloody,

71
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,530
that's enlightening man.
Paul Bernardo,

72
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:26,140
he's like the CEO of a meeting in that 
video,

73
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,810
you know,
it gives the cops hell.

74
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:30,130
It gives the lawyers hell protested his 
innocence.

75
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:35,131
He basically tells them that they're 
rude and untrustworthy because they 

76
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:39,931
don't trust him because he did a few 
little things 17 years ago and he gets 

77
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:40,810
away with it.
A few little things,

78
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:41,020
right?

79
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,490
I mean,
he killed a bunch of people,

80
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:46,040
including the sister of his girlfriend 
at the time and you know,

81
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,460
he was a repeat sexual offender and 
murderer.

82
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,960
It's.
But he basically goes,

83
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:50,530
well,
you know,

84
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,560
that's a long time ago.
It's like we're,

85
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,270
we're past that,
aren't we?

86
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,710
I mean,
I'm having a discussion with you.

87
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,990
I'm trying to solve help you solve some 
crimes,

88
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:01,390
which by the way I committed,
but we won't bring that up,

89
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,490
you know,
and you're,

90
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,450
you're,
you're accusing me of being a liar,

91
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:06,790
like you're not playing fair,
what's up with you?

92
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,220
And then when they answer,
he looks at his fingernails,

93
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:14,221
which is like,
that's a lovely little manipulative 

94
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,801
thing because it basically means 
whatever happens to be under my 

95
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:20,101
fingernail at the moment is much higher 
priority than listening to your foolish 

96
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:24,241
story and you watch,
you'll see people do that to you and 

97
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:24,241
then you get a little insight into what 
they're up to.

98
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,990
He's very good at that.
And so,

99
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,830
or he looks outside or are you just 
looked at his hands and he looks out the

100
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:32,950
window immediately.
Dismissive in his nonverbal behavior.

101
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,690
It's brilliant that the courts were 
forced to release that by the way,

102
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,050
but look it up,
Paul Bernardo on Youtube.

103
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,770
Wow.
It's,

104
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,180
it's just mind boggling.
It's,

105
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,260
he's so good at what he does and he's 
good looking and he's charismatic and 

106
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,150
you know,
he can really pull it off and you can't 

107
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,150
tell what's happening with the cops.
And the lawyers,

108
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,931
whether they're just letting them play 
as a routine to get some information 

109
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:58,930
from him or whether he's actually 
setting them back on his heels.

110
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:03,490
And I suspect it's a bit of both,
but it's a masterful performance.

111
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,510
If you didn't know who he was and you 
were watching it without the audio,

112
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:12,511
you'd think he's the CEO of some company
given its employees hell for not being 

113
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,410
up to scratch.
That's all his body language,

114
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,860
his eye contact,
everything just speaks that it's 

115
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:19,860
amazing.
