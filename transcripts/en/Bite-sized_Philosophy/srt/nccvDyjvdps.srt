1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,150
It's painful to understand how much of 
what you're doing isn't productive.

2
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:09,780
So I'll give you an example.
So I've done this a couple of times with

3
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:14,781
classrooms full of students.
Usually when I'm lecturing about career 

4
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:14,781
development,
say,

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:14,781
okay,
um,

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,060
how much time do you waste?
So then I get the class to vote.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,090
How many of you waste a 10 hours a day?
It's like 10 percent of the kids will 

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,231
put up their hands.
And it's interesting because I don't 

9
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:28,050
define what constitutes waste.
I just asked the question.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,300
So they're diagnosing themselves,
right?

11
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:32,490
I'm not saying you're wasting 10 hours a
day.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,270
I'm just asking.
It's like given your own attitude,

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,550
how much time you wasting 10 hours a 
day.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,440
It's like 10 percent of the people put 
up their hands.

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,200
Well when you get to like six hours a 
day,

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,060
80 percent of the people put up their 
hands.

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,180
So then we do the arithmetic.
It's like,

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,870
because I like doing arithmetic with 
people.

19
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,780
People hate arithmetic,
but I like doing it.

20
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,570
It's like,
okay,

21
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,450
six hours a day,
42 hours a week.

22
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,670
So let's call that a work week.
Forty hours a week,

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,530
so,
so that's,

24
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,900
that's a work week,
let's say what's your time worth,

25
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,160
your university student or certainly 
worth minimum wage because obviously,

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,340
but it's worth way more than that 
because if you spend a productive hour 

27
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,941
when you're 20 than you gain the 
benefits of that hour for the rest of 

28
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:17,751
your life.
So there's the compounding effect of 

29
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:17,751
time spent when we were young.
So I say,

30
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:19,410
well let's assume your time's worth 50 
bucks an hour,

31
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,360
which I think is an underestimate,
but whatever.

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,250
Let's call it 50.
We call it 25,

33
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,440
but we'll call it 50.
That's $2,000

34
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:28,140
a week.
You're wasting it's $100,000

35
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:28,530
a year.

36
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,330
It's like,
how much better would your life be if 

37
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:34,330
you weren't wasting $100,000
a year?

38
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,760
It's like,
what is that?

39
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:38,520
Over 40 years,
$4,000,000.

40
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,710
It's like you're rich.
You don't even know it.

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,160
Quit wasting time by your own 
definition.

42
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,410
It's like people shake their heads like,
oh,

43
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:47,700
I never thought about it that way.
It's like,

44
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,620
yeah,
think about it that way.

45
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,380
Don't waste your damn life.
And then you think,

46
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:57,381
well,
why would people be resistant to that 

47
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:57,381
message?
It's like,

48
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:59,661
well,
you really want to wake up and figure 

49
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,090
out that you're wasting half your life 
and you know,

50
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:02,970
when people do that kind of wasting,
they actually hate it.

51
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,330
You know?
And I've had lots of people come to my 

52
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:08,330
clinical practice who were chronic 
procrastinators,

53
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,010
you know,
and so they're watching youtube videos 

54
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,010
say,
but,

55
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,180
but not ones that are good for them,
although sometimes they will do that,

56
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:19,290
but just browsing and that kind of 
mindless way that you do when you're not

57
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:23,130
paying attention and you're trying to 
kill time and people doing that,

58
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:25,020
they feel bad,
they get depressed,

59
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,030
they feel anxious,
they can't get away from it.

60
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,450
They feel kind of addicted.
Saying about social media now.

61
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,760
It's a huge issue with young kids.
Absolutely.

62
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,910
But there's this feeling of kind of 
internal rot and corruption that goes 

63
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,910
along with it.
It's like,

64
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,790
yeah,
well you're wasting your life.

65
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,530
It's like,
so it's painful.

66
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,980
It's painful to recognize that.
Then it's painful to think,

67
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,770
oh my God,
look how undisciplined I am.

68
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,160
I don't know anything.
I can't use this schedule.

69
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,960
I can't.
I can't stick to a calendar.

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,080
I don't have any aims.
I don't know anything about the world.

71
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,590
Right.
And maybe there's a part of me that's 

72
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,000
bitter because I haven't got everything 
already and I'd like to say to hell with

73
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:06,001
it.
That's the recognition of the union 

74
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,831
shadow.
It's like that's what makes you a 

75
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:07,831
vicious and,
and,

76
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:08,380
and,
and untrustworthy all of that.

77
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,050
No one wants to look at that and no 
bloody wonder.

78
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,040
But Hey,
the alternative is worse.
