1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,280
You know,
you can't let the orderliness part of 

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,590
you get the upper hand so terribly that 
it's impossible for you to live.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,740
That's what happens to girls who have 
had [inaudible] by the way.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,930
You know how you get.
There's this idea with regards to 

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,981
anorexia that it's often high achieving 
girls who have it and while it's hyper 

6
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:20,040
conscientious girls,
they get so disgust sensitive.

7
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:23,100
They can't stand their own bodies and so
for example,

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,280
then they start being able to look at 
their bodies properly and so what they 

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:28,280
do instead of looking at their whole 
body,

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,220
they lose the ability to do that.
They only can see parts of their body 

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,130
and then they can't tell the difference 
between a part that's healthy and well 

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,700
shaped and a fat part and so anything 
that's that's,

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,840
that's what would you call of dubious.
Anything that's hard to measure becomes 

14
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:46,680
impossible to see.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,510
So either an anorexic client at one 
point,

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,780
she wasn't a very big woman maybe about 
this big and thin.

17
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,070
Yes,
obviously.

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,430
And so I was trying to work with her on 
her body perception disorder and one of 

19
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,870
the things I did was,
so I had her come and sit beside me,

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,120
so I was sitting like this and so is 
she.

21
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:04,830
And I said,
well you look at our two thighs,

22
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,340
which one is bigger?
Like mine was like 40 percent bigger.

23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,670
And she said,
well I can't tell they look the same to 

24
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,670
me.
And so I said,

25
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,670
okay,
this is what we're going to do.

26
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,790
I let her do it.
I said,

27
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:19,110
you take a pencil and also done a piece 
of paper and you just trace my thigh.

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,420
Okay.
And then you can put that piece of paper

29
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:24,300
underneath your thigh and trace it and 
then you can look at the difference.

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,300
Well,
so I had her do that and she looked at 

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:29,300
the two pieces of paper and she couldn't
believe it.

32
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,750
She could not believe that that was 
actually the case because her perception

33
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:38,340
had become so disordered that it was 
impossible for her to see the real shape

34
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:43,341
of her body.
And we would go outside and I would ask 

35
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:43,341
her,
you know,

36
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:44,640
is that person,
is that person fat and with other people

37
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:46,350
she could tell,
but with her own body,

38
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,110
not a chance.
She couldn't see it properly at all.

39
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,500
And so there was a real obsession with 
purity among women who have anorexia and

40
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:58,501
all,
they'd like to starve themselves right 

41
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:00,291
down to the bone because the bone is 
sort of pure and white and there's no 

42
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:04,371
excess tissue on it.
And so anorexia also looks like a 

43
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:04,560
disease of disgust.
So it's very,

44
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:05,890
very difficult to.

45
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,010
She she thought and very black and white
terms.

46
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:11,580
One of the things I had her do at one 
point was said she hasn't music.

47
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:16,581
She said,
I either really like a song or I don't 

48
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:16,581
like it at all.
And I said,

49
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:18,090
okay,
well you've got a music collection,

50
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,360
why don't you go through like 20 of 
those songs and rate them on a scale 

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,370
from one to 10.
And she couldn't do it.

52
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,620
It was either yes or no orderly,
right?

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,910
The boundaries around the categories 
were absolutely segregated.

54
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,180
And her apartment tended to be decorated
in black and white and she was hyper 

55
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,910
clean,
you know,

56
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:38,670
so everything in the apartment was 
extraordinarily orderly,

57
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:43,671
well put away.
She couldn't stand to see anything 

58
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:43,671
disgusting on the counters and that sort
of thing.

59
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:47,900
So very,
very difficult disorder to treat 

60
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:47,900
anorexia very,
very difficult.

61
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,680
So,
and you know,

62
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,340
you can see how it can go wrong because 
food,

63
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,430
when you're eating your disgust systems 
are on alert,

64
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,380
you know,
like you,

65
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,500
you want the thing you want to and you 
absolutely don't want the thing you 

66
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,910
don't want to eat and your mouth is very
sensitive to that sort of thing.

67
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,780
You know the texture and all of that and
your sense of smell is very sensitive to

68
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:12,781
that sort of thing because you know,
you don't want to eat anything that's 

69
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:13,900
contaminated or poisonous.
So it's another situation like sex where

70
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,220
the reward system is driving you forward
for,

71
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,760
to engage in a consumer story behavior.
But the disgust system is right there,

72
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,970
mo modulating and moderating it.
And there's a tension between those two 

73
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,100
things.
That's already always at work.

74
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,090
And with the anorexic types,
the disgust sense of disgust system gets

75
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:36,091
the upper hand.
So she was also extraordinarily 

76
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,761
judgemental and perfectionistic.
But that goes along with it because 

77
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:39,850
orderly people are judgemental and 
perfectionistic.

78
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,740
And so if you're,
you're a perfectionist,

79
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:45,850
often what that means is you have very 
high levels of orderliness and very high

80
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:50,851
levels of neuroticism.
And those two things chase each other 

81
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:53,761
around like mad because you can't stand 
the idea that you would make a mistake 

82
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:57,720
and you get anxious about it as well.
So then you get stuck in this 

83
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,030
perfectionistic mindset and you can't 
get out of it.

84
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,050
So.
