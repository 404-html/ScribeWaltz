1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,140
You know,
the idea of dream analysis I suppose is 

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,701
one of Freud's perhaps Freud's major 
contribution to modern western thought.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,490
The idea was there was something to 
dreams and I suppose what I did is said,

4
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:14,070
hey,
look,

5
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:19,071
isn't it strange we have this whole 
other form of thought that we engage in 

6
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:23,790
at night it and it speaks in the 
language that we don't really understand

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,450
and so what the hell is that?
And you can say,

8
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:32,451
and many modern people do dreams are of 
no significance or even that they're 

9
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:34,020
random processes,
which is an absurd proposition obviously

10
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:36,210
because they're by Terrell,
whatever they are,

11
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:38,750
they're obviously not random.
So.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,660
So Freud's idea was that there was some 
something in dreams that was 

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,900
informative,
so that's his.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Now he had a method for describe for 
extracting out from the dream what the 

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,460
dream purported to represent and he 
outlined that in great detail in the 

16
00:00:56,701 --> 00:01:01,701
interpretation of dreams,
and if you want to read one book by 

17
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:01,740
Freud,
I would highly recommend that one.

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,690
It's a very long book and it's very 
detailed,

19
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:08,691
but Freud does it extraordinarily 
comprehensive analysis of the way that 

20
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:12,501
dreams work.
Now he made the because because he had 

21
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:16,191
brought a theoretical framework to bear,
even on his investigation into dream 

22
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:21,081
structure,
he concluded that dreams were 

23
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,721
essentially wish fulfillments,
and that's where young and Freud 

24
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:28,220
disagreed.
He also believed that the primary 

25
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,130
motivating factor of human beings with 
sexual,

26
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:33,840
and now that's a tougher one to toss 
aside because even if you're a Darwinian

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,560
rather than afraid,
you're going to obviously support the 

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,611
proposition that sexual motivation among
any living creature is going to be one 

29
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:48,381
of the highest order motivations because
otherwise creatures don't reproduce and 

30
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:50,520
and prevail over the long run.
So the question is,

31
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:53,460
is that is that the ultimate source of 
motivation?

32
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:56,310
And in some sense the answer to that has
to be yes.

33
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,820
Well,
Freud wanted to make that in some ways 

34
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,011
the sole source of motivation,
and I'm over simplifying and I hate to 

35
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:07,311
do that in relationship to Freud because
he was not as simple minded character 

36
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:09,660
young how to dream wants,
if I remember correctly,

37
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,280
that Freud and you were excavating a 
basement.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,330
And so freud had outlined in Freud had 
already discovered the basement,

39
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:23,331
let's say.
So that would be the unconscious 

40
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:24,240
structure of the psyche and young broke 
through into another basement that was a

41
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:26,460
multi chambered place.
So many,

42
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:31,461
many,
many rooms and I suppose what drove 

43
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:35,151
young and freud apart was young's 
proposition that there was a hell of a 

44
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:36,090
lot more going down,
going on down there.

45
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:41,091
Then had already met the eye and they 
broke on the idea that the sexual 

46
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:42,900
impulse was primary,
roughly speaking,

47
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,170
they broke when you wrote a book called 
symbols of transformation,

48
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:47,620
which is actually.
There's,

49
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,030
there's three books that I know of that 
are sort of like maps of meaning.

50
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,060
One is symbols of transformation.
One is a book by Eric Norman called the 

51
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,721
origins and history of consciousness.
And the third and the third

52
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,450
one,
while his maps of meaning,

53
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,430
they're the same book.
They're just like,

54
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:06,430
they're trying to solve the same problem
from three different directions.

55
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,040
They're all attempts to address the same
problem.

56
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,640
And so symbols of transformation was a 
book that you wrote about the fantasies 

57
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,030
of schizophrenia,
American woman,

58
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,750
and he was.
He was trying to relate her fantasies to

59
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:23,590
these old mythological ideas and young's
idea essentially.

60
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:26,110
And this is an idea that was shared by 
people like piaget,

61
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:31,111
so we were not going to say that you and
or Freud just pulled this idea out of 

62
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,740
the air.
Was that the,

63
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,900
the birthplace of myth,
mythology and literature for that matter

64
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,260
was the dream that,
that they share structural that they 

65
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,200
share,
they sh,

66
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,290
they share what mode of information 
presentation and it's a relatively 

67
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,260
radical hypothesis,
but,

68
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,770
but given that they both,
they both represent

69
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:06,590
hmm

70
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,570
dreams,
dreams and mythological representations 

71
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,451
share and essentially narrative 
structure and they use their literary 

72
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:15,451
like,
you know,

73
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:19,030
I mean it's not so unreasonable to 
notice that a dream at night is like the

74
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:24,031
movie that you play in your head and 
it's not unreasonable to note as well 

75
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:28,351
that the dreams that you have at night 
bear a relationship to the daydreams 

76
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,680
that you have during the day.
It's a form of cognition.

77
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:32,170
It seems like an involuntary form of 
cognition though.

78
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:37,171
And that's a very strange thing.
So young thought about the dream as 

79
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:37,420
nature,
speaking of its own accord,

80
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,090
roughly speaking.
And so his idea was,

81
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:41,260
well,
when you,

82
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,050
when you sleep you dream.
But the dream happens to you,

83
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,410
it's not something that you create the 
way that you don't even think about 

84
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:49,410
creating it,
because I might say,

85
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,350
well,
what are you thinking about?

86
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:55,351
And you'll say,
I'm thinking about whatever it is and 

87
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:58,381
you'll take credit in some sense for 
thinking that because it seems like a 

88
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,441
voluntary activity,
but what happens at night is that you 

89
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:01,570
think,
but you think in voluntarily,

90
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,710
and so what young would say is that 
means that something is thinking in you

91
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,220
and that's a perfectly reasonable way of
looking at it and this is one of the 

92
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,461
things that's uncanny about the cycle 
analysts as they they were willing to 

93
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:17,360
take their observations to their logical
conclusion.

94
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,050
There are things that think in you.
What are those things and what are they 

95
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:27,620
thinking and why are they thinking it?
Now,

96
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,510
if you do dream analysis,
and this is a tricky thing because who's

97
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:34,910
to say if your damn analysis is correct?
Right?

98
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:37,370
It's very difficult to understand that.
If you.

99
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,430
If you do dream analysis with someone,
you generally have them lay out their 

100
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,241
dream and then you ask them when they're
going through their dream of second 

101
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:50,471
time,
they lay out their dream and you can 

102
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:51,881
kind of get a picture of it,
and then they lay out their dream a 

103
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:54,951
second time and as they go through it,
every time they mentioned a detail or a 

104
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:58,901
character,
you ask them what that reminds them of 

105
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,661
and the is that the dream is presenting 
an image or an idea that's associated 

106
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,100
with a network of ideas.

107
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,430
And then if you can expand on the 
network of ideas as you go through the 

108
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,860
dream,
you can elaborate on the dream.

109
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:14,270
You can expand it upwards and you can 
start to see what it might be attempting

110
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,400
to put forward.
Now,

111
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:19,250
Freud's idea was that the dream knew 
what it was doing,

112
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,490
but that its content was being 
suppressed and oppressed by an internal 

113
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,000
sensor.
So the dream had to be sneaky about what

114
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:29,960
it was saying because it was going to 
deliver a message that the person didn't

115
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:34,961
want to hear.
That that was tied up with his idea of 

116
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,260
repression,
but that's not young's idea.

117
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:37,790
See,
young's idea was different.

118
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:38,830
He said,
no,

119
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:43,831
no.
The dream is trying to tell you what is 

120
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:46,040
trying to tell you as clear as it can.
That's just the best it can do,

121
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,490
and so you could think of the dream,
and this is I believe,

122
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:50,540
the right way to think about it.

123
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,540
The dream is the birthplace of thought.
The same way that artists are the 

124
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,380
birthplace of culture.
It's exactly the same process.

125
00:06:57,381 --> 00:07:02,240
It's that your mind is groping outward 
to try to comprehend what it has not yet

126
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,310
comprehended and it does that first by 
trying to map it onto image and it's 

127
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:11,210
doing that in the dream and it's 
somewhat incoherent and and,

128
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,480
and well,
let's stick within coherent because it's

129
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:18,050
not yet a full fledged thought.
It's the birthplace of thought.

130
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,620
It's a fantasy about what might be,
and then if you can grip the fantasy and

131
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:29,861
share it with other people,
then maybe they can elaborate upon it 

132
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:32,771
and bring it into being with more 
clarity than it would be if it merely 

133
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:36,470
existed as the precursor of a thought in
your imagination.
