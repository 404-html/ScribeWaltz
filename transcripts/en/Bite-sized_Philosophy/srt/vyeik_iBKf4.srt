1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,670
One of the other things I've learned as 
a social scientist,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,480
and I've been warned about this by I 
would say great social scientists that 

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,060
you want to be very careful about doing 
large scale experimentation with large 

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,711
scale systems because the probability 
that if you implement a scheme in a 

5
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:27,550
large scale social system that that 
scheme will have the result you intended

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,790
is negligible.
What will happen will be something that 

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,620
you don't intend and even worse,
something that works at counter purposes

8
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:40,621
to your original intent and so and that 
that makes sense because if you have a 

9
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,250
very,
very complex system and you perturb it,

10
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,940
the probability that you can predict the
consequences of the perturbation is 

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,160
extraordinary low.
Obviously if the system works though,

12
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:58,060
you think you understand it because it 
works and so you think it's simpler than

13
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,540
it actually is,
and so then you think that your model of

14
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:06,541
it is correct and then you think that 
your manipulation of the model which 

15
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:10,951
produces outcome new model will be the 
outcome that's actually produced in the 

16
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,120
world.
Now it doesn't work at all.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,040
I thought about that an awful lot.
Thinking about how to remediate social 

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,841
systems because obviously they need 
careful attention and adjustment and it 

19
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:27,310
struck me that the proper

20
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,210
strategy for implementing social change 
is to stay within your domain of 

21
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,191
competence and that requires humility,
which is a virtue that is never

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,470
promoted in modern culture.
I would say it's.

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,770
It's a virtue that you can hardly even 
talk about,

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,500
but humility means you probably not as 
smart as you think you are and you 

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,570
should be careful and so then the 
question might be,

26
00:01:58,571 --> 00:01:59,590
well,
okay,

27
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:02,850
you should be careful,
but perhaps you still want to do good.

28
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,340
You want to make some positive changes.
How can you be careful and do good?

29
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:07,900
And then I would say,
well,

30
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,960
you try not to step outside of the 
boundaries of your competence and you 

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,411
start small and you start with things 
that you actually could adjust that you 

32
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:17,800
actually do understand,
that you actually could fix.

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,120
I mentioned to you at one point that one
of the things Carl Jung said was that 

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,630
modern men don't see God because they 
don't look low enough.

35
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,120
So very interesting phrase and one of 
the things that I've been promoting,

36
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:36,571
I suppose online is the idea that you 
should restrict your attempts to fix 

37
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:42,871
things to what's at hand.

38
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,340
So there's probably things about you 
that you could fix things that you know 

39
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,910
that aren't right,
not anyone else's opinion,

40
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:53,710
your own opinion that aren't right.
You can fix them.

41
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:56,050
Maybe there's some things that you could
adjust in your family,

42
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,230
although that gets hard.
You have to have your act together a 

43
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,871
lot.
You can start to adjust your family 

44
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:03,871
because things can kick back on you 
really hard and you think,

45
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:05,560
well,
it's hard to put yourself together.

46
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,540
It's really hard to put your family 
together.

47
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,790
Why the hell do you think you can put 
the world together?

48
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,630
Right?
Because obviously the world is more 

49
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:15,630
complicated than you and your family,
and so if you,

50
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,550
if you're stymied in your attempts even 
to set your own house in order,

51
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,700
which of course you are,
then you would think that what that 

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,551
would do would be to make you very,
very leery about announcing your broad 

53
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:27,910
scale plans for social revolution.

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,080
Well,
it's a peculiar thing because that isn't

55
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:37,081
how it works because people are much 
more likely to announce their plans for 

56
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:39,610
broad scale social revolution than they 
are to try to set themselves straight or

57
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:44,611
to set their family's straight and I 
think the reason for that is that as 

58
00:03:44,611 --> 00:03:45,550
soon as they try to set themselves 
straight or their families,

59
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,690
the system immediately kicks back at 
them right instantly.

60
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,080
Whereas if they announced their plans 
for large scale social revolution,

61
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,130
the lag between the announcement and the
kickback is so long that they don't 

62
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:03,060
recognize that there's any error there.
And so you know,

63
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,620
you can get away with being wrong if,
if,

64
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,940
if nothing falls on you for a while and 
so,

65
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,880
and it's also an incitement to hubris 
because you can now see your,

66
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,550
your plans for large scale social 
revolution and stand back and you don't 

67
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,950
get hit by lightning and you think,
well,

68
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:21,850
I might be right.

69
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,000
Even though you're not.
You're seriously not right.

70
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,010
I might be right.
And then you think,

71
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:28,960
well,
how wonderful is that?

72
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:31,540
Especially if you could do it without 
any real effort.

73
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,780
And I really do think fundamentally,
I believe that that's what universities 

74
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,470
teach students now.
That's what they teach them to do.

75
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,860
I really believe that.
And I think it's absolutely appalling 

76
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,500
and I think it's horribly dangerous 
because it's not that easy to fix 

77
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,890
things,
especially if you don't,

78
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,160
especially if you're not committed to 
it.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,100
And I think you know,
if you're committed because what you try

80
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:00,400
to do is you try to straighten out your 
own life first and that's enough.

81
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,430
Like there's this.
I think it's a statement in the new 

82
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,201
testament that it's,
I think it's in the new testament that 

83
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:07,390
it's more difficult to rule yourself 
than to rule the city.

84
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,890
And that's not a metaphor.
So like all of you who've made 

85
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:18,570
announcements to yourself about changing
your diet and going to the gym every 

86
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,820
January know perfectly well,
how difficult it is to regulate your own

87
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,250
impulses and to bring yourself under the
control of some.

88
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,120
What would you say?
Well structured and ethical,

89
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,120
attentive structure of values.
It's extraordinarily difficult.

90
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:44,491
And so people don't do it and instead 
they wander off and I think they create 

91
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:47,530
towers of Babel.
And the story indicates,

92
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,650
well those things collapse under their 
own weight and everyone goes their own 

93
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:52,650
direction.

94
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,760
I think I see that happening with the 
lgbt community.

95
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,880
I think because one of the things I've 
noticed,

96
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:06,881
it's very interesting because the 
community is in some sense it's not a 

97
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:07,190
community,
but

98
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,510
that's a technical error,
but it's.

99
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,850
It's composed of outsiders,
let's say,

100
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,930
and what you notice across the decades 
is that the acronym list keeps growing 

101
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,870
and I think that's because there's an 
infinite number of ways to be an 

102
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,961
outsider and so once you open the door 
to the construction of a group that's 

103
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:34,520
characterized by failing to fit into the
group,

104
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,510
then you immediately create a category 
that's infinitely expandable.

105
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,380
And so I don't know how long the acronym
list is now.

106
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,540
It depends on which acronym list you 
consult,

107
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,840
but I've seen lists of 10 or more 
acronyms and one of the things that's 

108
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:55,631
happening is that the community is 
starting to fragment in its in its 

109
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:01,811
interior because there is no unity.
Once you put a sufficient plurality 

110
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:07,541
under the sheltering structure of a 
single umbrella,

111
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:11,940
say the disunity starts to appear 
within,

112
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,630
and I think that's also a.
it's a manifestation of the same issue 

113
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,070
that this particular story is dealing 
with,

114
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,760
so that ends,
I would say,

115
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,870
the most archaic stories in the Bible.
There's something about the flood story 

116
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,170
and and also the Tower of Babel.
I think they outline the two fundamental

117
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:41,640
dangers that be set mankind.
One is the probability that

118
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,950
blindness and sin will produce a natural
catastrophe or entice one.

119
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,760
That's something modern people are very 
aware of in principle,

120
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:55,761
right?
Because we're all hyper concerned about 

121
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:55,761
environmental degradation and 
catastrophe,

122
00:07:55,761 --> 00:08:00,020
and so that's the continual reactivation
of an archetypal idea in our,

123
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:06,590
in our unconscious minds that there's 
something about the way we're living 

124
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,860
that's unsustainable and that will 
create a catastrophe and so interesting 

125
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,421
because people believe that firmly and 
deeply and but they don't see the 

126
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:17,880
relationship between that and the 
archetypal stories because it's the same

127
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:21,660
story.
Overconsumption greed,

128
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:26,661
all of that is producing an unstable 
state and nature will rebel and take us 

129
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:27,630
down.
Right?

130
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,470
You hear that every day in every 
newspaper and every TV station.

131
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,910
It's broadcast to you constantly,
so that idea is presented in,

132
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,660
in genesis and the story of Noah and 
then the other warning that exists in 

133
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:46,791
the stories.
One is beware of natural catastrophe 

134
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,551
that's produced as a consequence of 
blindness and greed will say the other 

135
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:53,931
is be aware of social structures.
That overreach because it will also 

136
00:08:56,251 --> 00:09:00,330
produce fragmentation and disintegration
and so it's quite remarkable.

137
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:05,331
I think that that with at the close of 
the story of the Tower of Babel,

138
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,540
we've got both of the permanent 
existential dangers that present 

139
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:15,870
themselves to humanity already 
identified.
