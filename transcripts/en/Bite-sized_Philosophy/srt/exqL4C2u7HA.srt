1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,930
When you claims,
for example,

2
00:00:02,931 --> 00:00:07,931
that you throw the baby out with the 
bathwater when you're trying to develop 

3
00:00:07,931 --> 00:00:12,430
and become a socially acceptable 
personality that happens in a different 

4
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:19,541
way as far as he's concerned for each of
the genders and so one of the prices 

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,360
young would say that we pay and that 
this is a very modern idea in some ways 

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,040
for growing up as a distinctly gendered 
society,

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:36,041
is that it's very easy for men to 
suppress and fail to develop,

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,530
to develop those elements of their 
character that might be considered 

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,191
classically feminine and it's difficult 
for women to develop and express those 

10
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,190
aspects of their personality that might 
be classically considered masculine and 

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,180
but so young believer that nested inside
the shadow in some sense where the 

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,400
Contra sexual capacities.
So for example,

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,770
for a man given what we knew about the 
temperamental difference between men and

14
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:10,430
women.
It may be that men could be more,

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,120
could develop the capacity for true 
compassion and care if they,

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:18,910
huh?

17
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,580
They could find that ability within what
they've thrown out in the shadow.

18
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,800
And women,
for example,

19
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:30,801
could find the capacity to be aggressive
and assertive because that's part of 

20
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:36,321
what they threw out during their stage 
of their course of development because 

21
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:40,401
of because of it's a priory 
categorization as inappropriate 

22
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,100
behavior.
Now,

23
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,880
that doesn't mean that you thought that 
there was,

24
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,670
that people should be raised without any
gender identity.

25
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:52,671
That issue never came up for him.
He just thought that once you had 

26
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:56,901
established a personality that was 
sufficiently developed to be acceptable 

27
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:02,200
socially and functional on the 
individual level,

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,570
then you could have the opportunity to 
expand that personality and to take into

29
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:12,571
yourself elements of of perception and 
thought and behavior

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,220
that

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,320
you wouldn't have had the sophistication
to be able to handle at an earlier stage

32
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:27,331
of development.
So young would say perhaps that if 

33
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:33,301
you're a male,
you have to become masculine before you 

34
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:33,550
could become feminine,
and if you were a female,

35
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:38,551
the reverse is true,
but that if your development only star 

36
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:42,430
stops with a narrow and categorical 
gender identity,

37
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,700
then there are elements that of of,
of being that you could draw on that 

38
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,880
aren't at your disposal and that will 
make you weak.

39
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,350
So the shadow breaks up into the anima 
anonymous and the atom is female inside 

40
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,020
the mail,
so to speak,

41
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:07,021
in the animist is the male inside the 
female and young believe that he could 

42
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:11,461
see those partial spirits manifesting 
themselves in people's behavior.

43
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:17,491
And so he talked about a couple of 
typical behaviors that he thought were 

44
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:21,010
associated either with Anima possession,
so that would be in the case of a man or

45
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,470
animas possession in the case of a 
woman.

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,090
And so he would regard.
If you ever talk to someone who's female

47
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,480
who seems to respond to all of your 
propositions with nothing but 

48
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,370
argumentation for the sake of 
argumentation.

49
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,610
Human would regard that as a 
manifestation of possession by the 

50
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,541
animus.
And if you ever talked to a man who is a

51
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,750
irrationally possessed by

52
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,710
second rate and few tile emotions,
then he would regard that as possession 

53
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:00,880
by the anima.
So,

54
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,280
and you can see that if you watch for 
it.

55
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,430
And if you believe in such things,
the best thing to do when confronted 

56
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:13,320
with someone who's Animus possessed is 
just shut up because you're not going to

57
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:18,321
make any headway.
Because the point of the argument of an 

58
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:21,360
animist inspired argument is to get you 
to argue not to win.

59
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,960
Because by getting you to argue the 
animus wins.
