1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,150
And by the time the Soviet revolution 
came around,

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:08,151
which would be at the latter part of the
19 tens after the first world war,

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,630
the peasant class had actually 
established farms,

4
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:14,400
of course,
varying productivity.

5
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:19,401
Some of the peasant farmers were very,
very good at being farmers and produced 

6
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:22,350
a huge proportion of rushes and the 
Ukraine's food.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,200
Because one of the things we'll talk 
about this later,

8
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:30,201
as the class progresses,
one of the things that you'll find if 

9
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:30,990
that if you look at creative production 
in any domain,

10
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:33,090
it doesn't matter.
Artistic Domain,

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,140
food production novels,
written novel,

12
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:38,640
Soul,
money generated,

13
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:40,140
number of companies,
generated,

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,020
number of goals,
scored in hockey,

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,140
et cetera.
Any number of paintings,

16
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:47,760
painted,
number of compositions,

17
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:49,020
written,
anything like that.

18
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:53,640
Where where the fundamental underlying 
measure as human productivity,

19
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:58,641
what you find is that a very tiny 
percentage of people produce almost all 

20
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:58,641
of the output.

21
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,890
It's called a pareto distribution.
P A r e t o,

22
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,700
and it was studied in detail in 
scientific productivity by someone named

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,670
does solar price.
It's a square root law.

24
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:10,470
So here's the law.
Fundamentally,

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,260
if you look at the number of people who 
are doing,

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,690
who are,
who are in a given domain,

27
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:20,691
who are producing in a given domain,
the square root of the people produce 

28
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:23,520
half the product,
so that means if you have 10 employees,

29
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:26,220
three of them do half the work,
but if you have 10,000

30
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:28,770
employees,
100 of them do half the work,

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,270
right?
It's a very,

32
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:35,271
very vicious statistic and you won't 
learn about that in psychology for 

33
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:38,841
reasons I have no idea about because you
learned about the normal distribution 

34
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:40,860
and not the prieto distribution,
but pareto distributions govern,

35
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,930
for example,
the distribution of money,

36
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,110
which is why one percent of the people 
in the general population have the 

37
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,551
overwhelming amount of money and one 
10th of that one percent has almost all 

38
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:52,551
of that.

39
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,650
Right?
So I think it's like the richest 100 

40
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,700
people in the world have as much money 
as the bottom two and a half billion and

41
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:01,230
you think,
well that's a terrible thing,

42
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:06,231
and perhaps it is.
But what you have to understand is that 

43
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:09,441
that law governs the distribution of 
creative production across all creative 

44
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:09,800
domains.
Right,

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,050
it's something like a natural law and we
can.

46
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,060
We'll talk about that more,
but imagine what happens when you play 

47
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,060
monopoly.
You've all played monopoly.

48
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,580
What happens when you play monopoly?
One person ends up with all the money,

49
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,950
right?
Then you play another game of monopoly.

50
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,980
What happens?
One person ends up with all the money.

51
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,160
It's actually the inevitable consequence
of multiple trades that are conducted 

52
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,150
randomly.
So if you take a thousand people and you

53
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:36,570
get them to play a trading game,
you get each give them $100,

54
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:41,571
say or $10,
and they have to trade with another 

55
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:41,571
person.

56
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:43,170
By flipping a coin I.
When the coin toss you give me a dollar,

57
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:44,400
you win,
I give you a dollar.

58
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,520
If we all play that long enough,
one person will end up with all the 

59
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:49,950
money and everyone else will end up with
zero.

60
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,460
So it's a deeply built feature of 
systems of creative production and no 

61
00:02:55,951 --> 00:03:00,951
one really knows what to do about it 
because of course the danger is is that 

62
00:03:00,951 --> 00:03:03,730
all the resources get funneled to a tiny
minority of people at the top and a huge

63
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:06,280
section of the population stacks up at 
zero.

64
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,790
But to blame that on the oppressive 
nature of a given system is to radically

65
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,260
underestimate the complexity of the 
problem.

66
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,500
No one actually knows how to effectively
shovel resources from the minority that 

67
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,530
that controls almost everything to the 
majority.

68
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:26,560
That has almost nothing in any 
consistent way.

69
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:31,561
Because as you shovel money down,
it tends to move right back up and it's 

70
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:31,561
a big problem.

71
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,400
Anyways.
The reason I'm telling you about that is

72
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:38,401
because after the peasants were granted 
their land and started to become 

73
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:40,810
farmers,
a tiny minority of them became extremely

74
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:45,811
successful and those people produced 
almost all of the food for Russia and 

75
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:47,950
Ukraine.
So what happened in the 19 twenties when

76
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,800
bloody lennon came along and 
collectivize the farms,

77
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:55,801
was that they defined the Kulaks who 
were these tiny minority of successful 

78
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:58,420
farmers who maybe had a brick house and 
were able to hire a couple of people and

79
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,830
had some land in some livestock and were
very productive people.

80
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,400
They define them as socially unfriendly 
elements and they sent groups of 

81
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,670
intellectuals out into the towns to 
collectivize the farms.

82
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:14,671
And so the idea was that while you would
pool your land and and everyone would 

83
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:18,010
farm it collectively and the land was 
taken away,

84
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,040
of course from the tiny minority of 
people who are actually productive and 

85
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,500
had actually managed to own much of the 
land.

86
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,750
So you have to imagine how that would 
occur.

87
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,150
Okay.
So it's in the 19 twenties,

88
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,660
it's after the world.
After World War One rushes in pretty bad

89
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:36,661
shape.
The villages are full of brutalized men 

90
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:39,331
who have posttraumatic stress disorder 
and lots of people who are not doing 

91
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:41,410
well at all in the bloody intellectuals 
come into the town and they say,

92
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,590
you know,
those successful farmers up the street 

93
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,110
that you've always been pretty jealous 
about in your useless manner while 

94
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,820
they're actually pigs and demons who are
stealing from you.

95
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:56,821
So why don't you come out.
We'll form a nice little mob and we'll 

96
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:57,610
take everything they've got.
And that's exactly what happened.

97
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:02,611
And all those people were killed or 
raped or set off to Siberia in the 

98
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:04,180
middle of the bloody winter where there 
wasn't even anything for them to.

99
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,150
To anywhere for them to live or anything
for them to eat.

100
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,240
So they all died.
And then the consequence of that was a 

101
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,630
few years later,
6 million people starved to death in the

102
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:14,200
Ukraine.
