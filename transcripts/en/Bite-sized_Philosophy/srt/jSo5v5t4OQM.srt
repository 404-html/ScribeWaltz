1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,630
Okay,
now now down to cognitive ability.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,650
Well,
how can you conceptualize intelligence?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well,
this is a major problem because your 

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,850
initial conceptualization determines in 
part the strategies that you're going to

5
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:23,800
use to investigate intelligence and when
you say when you,

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,950
when you pair a sentence down to what is
intelligence,

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,220
the sentence is problematic because part
of it is a question about if and how 

8
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:36,370
such a thing might manifest itself in 
the world.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,760
So there's a fact out there that are set
of facts that corresponds to 

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,700
intelligence,
but the other problem is,

11
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:47,701
well,
what do you mean when you say 

12
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:47,701
intelligence?
And you kind of have to nail that down.

13
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:52,561
If you're going to have a conversation 
about intelligence that doesn't go 

14
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:56,611
entirely astray and so you've got a,
you've got a definitional problem as 

15
00:00:56,611 --> 00:01:00,400
well as an empirical problem.
And so there have been,

16
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,530
and this was especially true in the 19 
nineties,

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,240
people have been studying intelligence 
Iq intelligence since the 19 twenties 

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,980
and,
and it's a very well established branch 

19
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,141
of psychology.
One of the things I have to tell you 

20
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:18,391
about Iq research is that if you don't 
buy Iq research,

21
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,970
you might as well throw away all the 
rest of psychology and the reason for 

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:23,970
that is that

23
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,180
the psychologists,
first of all,

24
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:31,181
who developed intelligence testing were 
among the early psychologists who 

25
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:35,021
instantiated the statistical techniques 
that all psychologists use to verify and

26
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:40,151
test all of their hypotheses.
So you ended up throwing the baby out 

27
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:43,601
with the bathwater and the ICU.
People have defined intelligence in a 

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
more stringent,
stringent and accurate way than we've 

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,860
been able to define almost any other 
psychological construct.

30
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,980
And so if you toss out the one that's 
most well defined,

31
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,290
then you're kind of stuck with the 
problem of what are you going to do with

32
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:02,291
all the ones that you have leftover that
are nowhere near as well defined or as 

33
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,610
well measured,
or as or as or.

34
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,820
Or who's predictive.
Validity is much less than it has been 

35
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,290
demonstrated with much less vigor and 
clarity anyways.

36
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:17,291
Despite all that.
People have posited a number of 

37
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,060
different intelligences and reasonably 
so because there's.

38
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,190
If you think of intelligence as that 
which might move you forward 

39
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,991
successfully in the world,
obviously there's a fair number of 

40
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:32,740
phenomena that are associated with 
individuals that might fit into that 

41
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,831
category,
so we have people have made these 

42
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,410
distinctions.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,030
Bob Sternberg,
for example,

44
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:47,031
is distinguished between practical 
versus analytical intelligence and he 

45
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:51,291
kind of thinks of practical as like 
street smarts and has attempted to 

46
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:55,341
dissociate that from the kind of 
analytical intelligence that that 

47
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,550
characterizes more straight Iq research.
I don't think he's done it successfully 

48
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,720
as well at all and since the 19 
nineties,

49
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,870
interest in his practical intelligence 
has declined precipitously because when 

50
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:10,780
it is matched head to head with standard
Iq intelligence,

51
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,750
the Iq intelligence seats up pull the 
variability.

52
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,590
What's really happened as far as I can 
tell so far is that when we're trying to

53
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:22,591
predict people's course through life,
Iq does a very good job and then one of 

54
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:27,100
the traits does a very good job as well,
which is conscientiousness,

55
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,520
but it doesn't do as good a job as Iq.
Now,

56
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:33,610
that partly might be because we can't 
measure conscientiousness very well.

57
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,750
We're stuck with self reports or maybe I
could gather peer reports about you or I

58
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:44,751
could gather your parents reports about 
your teachers reports and each of those 

59
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:48,780
seems to pick up a little bit more of 
the pattern because you know yourself,

60
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:52,320
but other people know you differently 
than you know yourself and there's still

61
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:57,321
some accuracy in that.
You can get multiple rater reports of 

62
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:57,930
something like conscientiousness and 
that'll up.

63
00:03:57,931 --> 00:04:00,750
It's predictive validity,
but in the final analysis,

64
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:05,751
the best you seem to be able to deal 
with conscientiousness is about a point 

65
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:06,240
four correlation with longterm 
performance.

66
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:11,241
Whereas with Iq in complex jobs,
you can probably get point five and 

67
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:14,280
maybe point six and so point five is 25 
percent of the variance.

68
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,920
You got a square it point six is 30 
percent,

69
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,210
36 percent of the variance and point 
four is 16 percent of the variance.

70
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,200
So even at the low end,
let's say high end for conscientiousness

71
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:30,201
is point four or 16 percent.
Low End for Iq is point five or 25 

72
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:35,511
percent low end estimates of Iq make it 
one and a half times more powerful than 

73
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:39,921
the high end estimates of 
conscientiousness and I think that's 

74
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:39,921
about right.
You'd think,

75
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:44,271
why do we even have to debate this and 
because it's so bloody obvious to me 

76
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:45,420
that intelligence is a major predictor 
of life success.

77
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:50,421
I mean you people,
I've measured the Iq of University of 

78
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:50,421
Toronto people,
you know,

79
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:53,580
people in this room who have an Iq of 
less than 120 are rare.

80
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,930
Well,
why?

81
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,170
Well smart people go to university now.
Is that actually a contentious 

82
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,371
statement?
What shouldn't be a contentious 

83
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:04,371
statement?
It's self evident.

84
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:08,001
Universities were actually set up so 
that smart people could expand their 

85
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:08,250
abilities.
That's why they were there.

86
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:13,251
And you're selected on the basis of 
assessments that are essentially there 

87
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:13,260
to assess something like intelligence.

88
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,750
Yes,
but that,

89
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,830
that will,
that will,

90
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,220
that is part of the controversy.
Is it reasonable?

91
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,100
And this is a measurement issue and 
that's why we're.

92
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,160
That's why I've been instructing you to 
some degree in psychometrics because we 

93
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,400
actually know how to do this.
We know how to answer that question,

94
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,760
so let's take a look at how at how 
intelligence has been assessed and why,

95
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,350
and then you can make up your own mind 
anyways.

96
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:49,351
Here's some of the examples of other 
forms of intelligence and so then the 

97
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:50,590
question is,
well,

98
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,740
what does it mean to have a different 
form of intelligence?

99
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:57,130
Would would form a and form b be 
completely uncorrelated,

100
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,250
like extroversion,
say in neuroticism or would they be 

101
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,561
slightly correlated or would they be 
highly correlated and then you might 

102
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:05,561
ask,
well,

103
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:09,010
how highly correlated did they have to 
be before they're the same thing or how 

104
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:14,351
uncorrelated did they have to be before 
they're different things and actually 

105
00:06:14,351 --> 00:06:16,130
the answer to that comes down to 
something like practical utility.

106
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,370
It's like,
imagine I'm trying to figure out how 

107
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,940
well you'll do in university and I 
measure one thing and it's correlated at

108
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:25,220
point seven with another thing I measure
about you.

109
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,240
Then I might say,
well,

110
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,920
are those two things the same or 
different?

111
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:32,921
They're pretty highly correlated.
Your high in one means you're going to 

112
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:35,231
be high in the other while,
so what is there any utility in 

113
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:39,371
measuring both things and the way you 
figure that out actually is you do it 

114
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:40,430
statistically,
so we take the target,

115
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:43,370
which might be your performance across 
university.

116
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,540
Then we say,
well,

117
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:49,541
can we predict your performance across 
university better by using one variable 

118
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:54,280
or two variables?
So we would enter them both into a 

119
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,190
regression equation.
All a regression equation does.

120
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,460
It's quite simple,
so you're trying to predict the target 

121
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,090
and the regression age regression 
equation tells you how well you can 

122
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,130
predict that target.

123
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,340
If you know another fact now,
then it gets a little complicated 

124
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:14,150
because that's a correlation.
How well you can predict be with a well.

125
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,940
A regression will say how much you can 
predict.

126
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,970
See if you know a and B or a and B and c
and d and e because you can use multiple

127
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:27,761
predictors and you can weight them.
So it might be two times a plus one 

128
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:32,081
times b equals c,
and that's all a regression equation 

129
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:32,180
does is just multiplication and 
addition.

130
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,410
Very,
very straightforward.

131
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,650
And so two variables are sufficiently 
different functionally if you can use 

132
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,630
both of them simultaneously to predict 
something of interest.

133
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,030
So again,
it's a tool like approach.

134
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,850
This is how the psychometricians do.
It is something real.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,780
Well,
it's real.

136
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,130
If you can measure,
measure it,

137
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,810
it,
it helps you predict that's,

138
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,850
that's how it's defined.
So then you might say,

139
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:57,851
well,
are are there these multiple 

140
00:07:57,851 --> 00:07:57,851
intelligences?

141
00:07:57,851 --> 00:07:59,330
Well,
the first question would be,

142
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,460
well,
what do you mean by are there?

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,380
And that answer to that would be,
well,

144
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:06,650
let's specify the question since we're 
going to be scientific about it.

145
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,200
Let's predict how well people do in 
university.

146
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:12,050
We'll start with the assumption that 
intelligence,

147
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,270
if intelligence isn't associated with 
university success,

148
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,060
then you're probably not talking about 
intelligence.

149
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,100
Now you could argue that,
right?

150
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,030
Because you could say,
well,

151
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:25,370
intelligence has nothing to do with 
university success,

152
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,550
but that's a definitional matter.
We'd have to agree to begin with.

153
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,510
Is it reasonable to start with the 
presupposition that intelligence and 

154
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,290
university success share something in 
common?

155
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,600
Well,
I think you have to be daft to,

156
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,140
to deny that initial proposition.
Although you could,

157
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,410
because you could say it was privileged 
or socioeconomic status or or or,

158
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,430
or any number of sociological phenomena 
and some of those are obviously relevant

159
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,200
social class for example,
because you know,

160
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,970
if you're in a higher social class and 
all things being equal,

161
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,970
intelligence included,
if you're in a higher social class,

162
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:05,520
you're more likely to go to university 
then you are if you're in a lower social

163
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:06,690
class.
So there's other,

164
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,990
there's other factors that are going to 
influence whether or not you do well in 

165
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,411
university,
but we're going to assume that one of 

166
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:15,411
them might be intelligence.

167
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:16,630
Well then you would ask,
well,

168
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,510
if you measured social intelligence,

169
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,790
so that's what do they call that?
Social Intelligence.

170
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,110
Now,
emotional intelligence,

171
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,650
which does not exist by the way.
Emotional intelligence,

172
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,630
moral intelligence,
linguistic musical,

173
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:31,740
logical,
mathematical,

174
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,270
spacial body,
kinesthetic,

175
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:36,570
interpersonal and intrapersonal.
All different forms of intelligence.

176
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,780
Okay,
so to answer the question of whether 

177
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,391
they exist,
what you do first is pick a target 

178
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:47,810
prediction of university performance.
Then you make a measure for each of 

179
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,201
them.
Then you test to see if the measure 

180
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:52,560
measured the same thing across multiple 
instances within the same person.

181
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:55,500
That's a reliability tests because what 
the hell good is your ruler.

182
00:09:55,501 --> 00:10:00,501
If it stretches when you use it,
it has to measure the same thing 

183
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:00,660
multiple times and then you would say,
okay,

184
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,780
we'll take all these different 
intelligences measured the way we've 

185
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,041
decided to measure them.
The first thing we'll do is see how 

186
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:10,041
highly correlated they are because if 
they're complete,

187
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,340
two of them are completely correlated.

188
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,370
Then you have one.
You don't have to because that's 

189
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:16,800
virtually the definition of one.
Instead of two.

190
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,010
You can factor analyze them and see if 
you can pull out what's common across 

191
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,911
all of them.
That's another thing because then you 

192
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:25,911
might say,
well,

193
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:27,420
intelligence is what's common across all
the measures of these intelligences.

194
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,210
It's a proposition.
It's not a fact.

195
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,160
You have to decide if you're going to 
agree with it,

196
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:35,250
but that if you were going to do that,
you'd use a factor analysis.

197
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:35,970
You'd say,
well,

198
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,910
if someone was more likely to be 
musical,

199
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,060
if they were also high in linguistic 
ability and more likely to be logical 

200
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,540
and mathematically inclined,
if they had a high spatial ability,

201
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:50,541
et Cetera,
then you'd be hypothesizing that there 

202
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,971
was one factor behind all of those 
manifestations that somehow similar and 

203
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:58,281
maybe there wouldn't be,
and then you take all your measures and 

204
00:10:58,281 --> 00:11:01,101
you put them in something like a 
multiple regression analysis and you'd 

205
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:03,060
predict your target university 
performance and then maybe you'd say,

206
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:03,660
well,
wait a minute.

207
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:06,240
Let's not just use university 
performance.

208
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,380
Let's use junior high performance,
high school performance,

209
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:15,470
university performance and job success,
and then let's say that the only things 

210
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:19,740
that predict success across all of those
categories and that are the same,

211
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:21,780
we're going to define as intelligence.
Well,

212
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,610
that's basically how you end up with Iq.

213
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,060
You could say that Iq is what's common 
across all possible sets of of 

214
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,930
intelligence tests.
Now people are going to debate that 

215
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,750
because you still have to define what 
constitutes a test,

216
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,020
but the way the psychometricians have 
managed it and have taken care of this 

217
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,120
at least to some degree,
is to say,

218
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,580
well,
we're going to.

219
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,490
We're not going to define everything 
that we measure as intelligence,

220
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,220
so extroverted people are more socially 
fluent.

221
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,220
We're going to call that intelligence.
No,

222
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,540
we're going to call that personality.
We're going to call that extroversion 

223
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:00,540
and we're going to call stress 
tolerance.

224
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,240
You could say,
well,

225
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,090
if you can tolerate more stress,
you're more intelligent.

226
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,660
It's like,
well,

227
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:06,130
no,
that isn't how we've defined it.

228
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,740
We're going to define that as being 
lower in neuroticism.

229
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,320
If you're cooperative,
you're more intelligent.

230
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:13,300
That's emotional intelligence.
Well,

231
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:15,580
what you're less intelligent if you're 
competitive.

232
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,690
Well,
no,

233
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,050
so we parsed that off to agreeableness,
so then the question might be,

234
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,500
is there anything left of these so 
called intelligences?

235
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,420
Once you control for personality and Iq 
and the answer is no.

236
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,450
Nothing,
nothing left of them,

237
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,720
and the people who keep pushing these 
ideas keep trying to push them because 

238
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,960
they don't like the idea of real 
individual differences,

239
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,140
and to me that's just a matter of 
sticking your damn head in the sand 

240
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,470
because it's obvious here,
you're going to have a child,

241
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,390
you want the child to have an Iq of 65 
or 145 decide,

242
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,980
okay,
so you're all going to vote.

243
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,220
Okay.
You think any one of you is going to 

244
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,691
vote to have a child with an Iq of 65,
that child is going to have a hard time 

245
00:12:57,691 --> 00:13:00,340
developing even linguistic ability.
They're never going to learn to read,

246
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,310
right?
They're never going to leave home in all

247
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:05,320
likelihood.
So which child are you going to pick?

248
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:11,130
Well,
so do you believe in intelligence or 

249
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:11,130
not?
Well,

250
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:11,130
obviously if you have any sense.
