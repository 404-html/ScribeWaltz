1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,600
One of the things that Carl Jung said 
that I thought was really interesting 

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,390
when he was talking about the Oedipal 
situation and families,

3
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:09,150
I never forgot this,
so the Oedipal situation,

4
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:11,170
roughly speaking,
is when I'll,

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,550
I'll lay out the classic story is when a
child is seriously over-protected,

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,800
usually a male child by his mother.
Now the reverse can be the case and it 

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,290
can be a female child by the mother and 
all of that,

8
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,930
but I'll just talk about the classic 
case to begin with.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,320
Now.
What Freud observed was that there were 

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,871
usually not very good boundaries in 
families like that and so the 

11
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:36,621
relationship between the husband and the
wife was either strange or nonexistent 

12
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:40,610
and the wife would often turn to the 
child to be what she isn't getting from 

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,991
the husband,
and so there's a great south park 

14
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:47,721
episode about this,
a wonderful south park episode where 

15
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:47,721
they were.

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,590
I don't remember that horrible little 
guy.

17
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,850
Is that.
That's him.

18
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:51,420
Yeah,
yeah,

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,930
yeah.
And his mother brings in the dog 

20
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,290
whisperer to train him and it's 
brilliant.

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,320
It's brilliant episode.
If you want to learn about Freud and 

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,140
Freud and Oedipal situation,
you watch that.

23
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:07,350
You've got it down cold because she 
brings in this expert who then she wants

24
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:12,351
to have an affair with,
so that's a boundary issue and he 

25
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:13,170
basically separates her son from him and
and,

26
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,180
and imposes the same discipline on him 
that he would get impose on a bad dog.

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,720
Although he also trains the dogs owners 
all the time because maybe it's not the 

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,570
dog.
Maybe it's the owner.

29
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,960
There's a horse whisperer movie too,
about the original horse whisperer.

30
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:31,920
That does a beautiful job of laying that
out too because he's very good at fixing

31
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:36,921
problem horses and unbelievably good at 
diagnosing psychopathology on the part 

32
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:37,980
of the owner.

33
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,960
It's his,
he's got a gift for it.

34
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,020
But anyways,
what happens in this South Park episode 

35
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,800
is that the dog whisperer gets cartland 
yeah.

36
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,940
Straightened out and he starts like 
dressing properly and doing his homework

37
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:55,941
and,
and the mother is pursuing an affair 

38
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:55,941
with the dog whisperer,
but he's professional.

39
00:01:55,941 --> 00:02:00,641
He keeps his distance,
like he keeps boundaries around him and 

40
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:04,730
then he leaves.
And then the first thing that she does 

41
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,981
when he leaves his bride carton and 
basically out of doing his homework so 

42
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:09,340
that he can accompany her to,
I don't know,

43
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:11,310
a fast food restaurant or something like
that.

44
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,550
And so the reason she does that is 
because she's lonesome and doesn't have 

45
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,550
anybody else around.
And you know,

46
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,510
maybe she's also deeply,
deeply,

47
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,600
deeply terrified that if she helps that 
boy grow up,

48
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,310
he will leave and she'll have nothing,
you know.

49
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,700
And so mothers who don't have something 
say outside their infants,

50
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,910
not merely their children are more 
likely to fall into that.

51
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,990
And it's no wonder,
you know,

52
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:37,290
you got to think that through.
And lots of women really,

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,710
most women really fall in love with 
their babies,

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,800
you know.
And so even if they start growing into 

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,530
larger children,
that can be threatening because,

56
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,270
well,
when that,

57
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,660
when the child turns into,
when the infant turns into a toddler 

58
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,410
that the infant is dead,
the toddler is there now.

59
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,160
And you can radically interfere with 
that process.

60
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,330
That happens all the time,
all the time.

61
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:03,580
That's the classic Freud in Eda pulled 
nightmare.

62
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,910
And that episode is brilliant,
it's bloody brilliant,

63
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:10,630
it just nails it and some of you have 
been in my personality class and watched

64
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,220
crumb the documentary crum,
and that's another staggering exposition

65
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:18,280
of exactly that kind of pathology.
Anyways,

66
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,500
one of the things you pointed out,
so I knew this guy once who had a mother

67
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,890
who basically was trying that trick and 
she had lots of.

68
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,310
She was very smart and had lots of 
tricks up our sleeves and there's just 

69
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,700
no way he was going to go for.
He rebelled at every possible moment and

70
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,440
he basically became,
I would say,

71
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:38,320
somewhat hypermasculine in response,
which is a.

72
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,470
which is an interesting lesson with 
regards to the hypermasculinity that 

73
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,741
boys often develop if they're raised by 
single mothers because they tend to go 

74
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:49,921
one of two ways and he just thought her 
at every step of the way and it didn't 

75
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:52,960
happen.
But one of the things you said,

76
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:57,961
which I loved,
and you can really see this in the 

77
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,851
chrome documentary,
is that the eternal mother basically 

78
00:03:59,851 --> 00:04:00,220
entices.
The child says,

79
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:02,200
look,
here's the deal.

80
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,070
You don't have to do anything but you 
don't get to leave,

81
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,280
but if you don't leave and you don't do 
these difficult things,

82
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:12,820
then I'll take care of you and the child
has a choice all the way along there.

83
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,910
I mean,
obviously he's outclassed in some sense,

84
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:20,911
but it's not as obvious as you'd think.
Little kids are tough and they make 

85
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:24,871
decisions all the time and so Jung 
thought about it more as a conspiracy 

86
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:27,070
than as something imposed on the child 
by the mother and I really like.

87
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,050
It's actually a conspiracy between 
mother,

88
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:34,051
father,
and child actually and I think that's a 

89
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:34,051
good way of looking at it even though 
it's really rough because said,

90
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:36,220
well,
should you hold a child responsible?

91
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,710
Well,
yes,

92
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,100
but judiciously and not completely 
because then if you deal with someone 

93
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,130
like that as an adult and they're trying
to escape from it,

94
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,430
you have to go all the way back and 
figure out how the hell had happened and

95
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:53,431
then they have to adjust.
They have to figure out where they 

96
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:56,580
opened the door,
like inviting a vampire in because they 

97
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,840
can't come in unless you invite them in,
you know,

98
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,580
so don't invite them in because once 
they're in,

99
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:03,520
they're really hard to get rid of and 
they'll take all your blood.

100
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,980
So that's a cautionary tale.
