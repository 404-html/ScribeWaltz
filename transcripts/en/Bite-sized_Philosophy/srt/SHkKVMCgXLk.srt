1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,430
And this is what behavior therapists do.
They decompose your problems.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,020
What are you afraid of?
Well,

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,970
okay,
you're afraid of everything.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,090
Well,
let's get something specific you're 

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,090
afraid of.
Well,

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,090
I'm afraid of an elevator.
Okay.

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,930
An elevator.
So I have a client,

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,550
she's afraid of elevators.
The elevator door open.

9
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:18,190
She goes,
that's a tube.

10
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,350
And I thought,
oh wow.

11
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:23,650
I thought it was an elevator.
But for you it's not a bloody elevator.

12
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,740
It's death.
And so that's what you're afraid of.

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,980
It's worse than that.
You're afraid of being trapped inside 

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:31,980
there in the dark alone,
alone,

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,780
not knowing if anyone is going to rescue
you,

16
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,270
stuck there with your damn imagination 
freaking out.

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,920
It's like.
And if that's not,

18
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,130
and then maybe you have a heart attack 
because you're so terrified and you die.

19
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,080
It's like,
you know,

20
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,690
so that's the elevator.
Well,

21
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:51,691
it's no bloody wonder.
No one's going to get into something 

22
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:53,761
like that.
And then maybe underneath that is your 

23
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:53,860
distrust in the mechanisms of society,
right?

24
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:58,480
Because you know a normal person that 
was weird creatures,

25
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,280
they'll get an elevator.
What the hell?

26
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:05,281
They don't care.
And partly it's because they have an 

27
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:05,281
implicit belief,
even if the thing stops,

28
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:09,840
somebody will come along and rescue them
and usually you don't even think about 

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:09,840
it,
right?

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:09,840
It's like,
wow,

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,960
what the hell?
It's an elevator.

32
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,280
So like

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,870
the danger is invisible to you

34
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,250
and it's partly because you implicitly 
trust the structure and so maybe you go 

35
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,671
into the unconscious presuppositions of 
the person who is terrified of the 

36
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:29,141
elevator in the subways and you find out
they have a real problem with trusting 

37
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:32,441
authority.
That's partly why they don't get along 

38
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:32,720
with her husband and why they'd never 
been able to stand up for themselves.

39
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,640
So then you say,
okay,

40
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:36,170
while you're afraid of the damn 
elevator,

41
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:37,850
but it's not an elevator,
it's a tomb.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And the tomb is partly you.
And partly it's partly the elevator and 

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,360
partly your unconscious mind.
And so well,

44
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:49,361
what can you handle?
Can you go and look at an elevator from 

45
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:49,361
10 feet away?
It's like,

46
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:50,240
yes.
Okay.

47
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,280
How about nine feet away?
Yes.

48
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,380
Five feet.
Four feet?

49
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,700
No.
Okay.

50
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:57,410
No problem.
Four and a half feet.

51
00:01:57,411 --> 00:02:02,411
We're going to go from that elevator and
we're going to look at the damn thing 

52
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:03,660
until you're bored of it because that's 
what we're trying to.

53
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,580
You should be board of the elevator 
because then you're not afraid of it.

54
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:09,530
Obviously.
It's like an elevator.

55
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,330
You just don't notice it.
Right?

56
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,300
All of these things around here that you
don't notice.

57
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,520
I'd take you out of here and ask you 
what color the walls are.

58
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:18,770
You haven't got any idea.
You know,

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,810
I,
I suspect for most of you,

60
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:25,811
there's not a chance you'd be able to 
identify the gender of the person who's 

61
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:26,780
sitting next to you unless you know 
them.

62
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,630
It's like you just don't remember 
anything and why should you?

63
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:32,690
Everything works like you don't have to 
pay attention to it.

64
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,100
It's like,

65
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,810
does that stay up?
Yeah,

66
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,090
it's still up.
Yeah.

67
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,820
Still up.
Still up.

68
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,840
It was like,
really?

69
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,490
No,
you know,

70
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:46,490
you get bored of that real quick and so 
then you just ignore it and.

71
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,840
But the agoraphobic has had that veil of
ignorance torn away and what they see 

72
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:55,400
behind it is mortal threat.
And so that's really what you're helping

73
00:02:55,401 --> 00:03:00,401
them deal with.
And so this week there are four and a 

74
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:03,791
half from the elevator.
Next week they're a foot from the 

75
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,971
elevator and the week after that the 
horrible gates of hell opened and they 

76
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:07,570
look inside and they don't run.
And so,

77
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:12,571
hey,
they're tougher than they thought they 

78
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:12,571
were.
And that's what you're teaching them.

79
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:14,920
Actually you're not teaching them that 
the world isn't dangerous because that's

80
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:17,140
a stupid thing to teach someone bloody 
right?

81
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:19,270
The world is dangerous.
It's terrifying.

82
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,720
And sometimes people under a realize 
that and the veil lifts and they see 

83
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,510
horror everywhere.

84
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,550
They see that and then they think,
well,

85
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,650
I'm just a little rabbit.
I'm over here in the corner.

86
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,900
I can't move.
I'm petrified.

87
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,500
And then they can't move.
They hide it home.

88
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,340
The cower at home because everything is 
become a predatory domain.

89
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,620
And so what you teach them is you're not
as much of a rabbit as you think.

90
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,930
And part of that is that you help them 
grow.

91
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:51,931
Some teeth so that they can go home and 
have that fight with their husband that 

92
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,210
they should have had 25 years ago and it
happens very frequently with agoraphobic

93
00:03:55,211 --> 00:04:00,211
clients that you get them so they can go
on the damn elevator and they can go on 

94
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:01,030
the subway,
they can take a taxi.

95
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:03,790
It maybe they learn to drive.
Wow.

96
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,090
That gets some autonomy and then they're
a little tougher and so then they can 

97
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,740
stand up for themselves and they go back
and like their husband might not be very

98
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:13,930
happy with any of this really.

99
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,850
It depends on what sort of guy he is.
You know,

100
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:20,851
if he's a real tyrant,
he might be just perfectly happy that 

101
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:22,990
he's married to someone who was afraid 
of her own shadow because then she won't

102
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,050
ever leave.
And so that's a nasty little story and 

103
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,210
believe me,
it's not uncommon.

104
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,660
So she gets tougher by facing what she 
fears and what she finds out is there's 

105
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,840
a hell of a lot more to her than she 
thought.

106
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,230
And that's really what happens when you 
do behavior therapy with someone who's 

107
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,290
agoraphobic.
It isn't really that they get less 

108
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:43,290
afraid,
it's that they get braver.

109
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,970
That's way different.
It's because brave is alert and able to 

110
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:51,850
cope.
Naive is there's no danger.

111
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:53,050
It's like hell,
you have right?

112
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,430
There's no danger.
Jesus.

113
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:55,930
What a stupid theory that is.
