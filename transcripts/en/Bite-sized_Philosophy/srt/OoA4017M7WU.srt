1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,570
The next best predictor of lifetime 
success is conscientiousness,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,780
while so and of the,
of the two aspects of conscientiousness 

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,510
say orderliness and industriousness.
The better predictor is industriousness.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,710
So the question is,
well,

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,570
what can you do about your 
industriousness?

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,780
And the answer to that is,
well that's kind of rough too because 

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,380
there's a strong genetic component,
but you can work on micro habits with 

8
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:28,170
regards to your conscientiousness and I 
think the best micro habits.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,620
This is partly to do with this future 
authoring program processes.

10
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:36,621
I think the best thing you can do with 
regards to your conscientiousness is to 

11
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:40,020
set up some aims for yourself.
Goals that you actually value and the 

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,520
future authoring program helps people do
that and basically it does a situational

13
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:49,521
analysis of it helps you do a 
situational analysis of your life more 

14
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:50,790
than a psychological analysis I would 
say.

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,980
And so the questions are something like,
well,

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,580
alright,
you're going to have to put some effort 

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:58,710
into your life and you need to be 
motivated to do that.

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,590
And so what are the potential sources of
motivation?

19
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,930
You could think about them in the big 
five manner.

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,600
If you're extroverted,
you want friends,

21
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,640
if you're agreeable,
you want an intimate relationship.

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,280
If you're disagreeable,
you want to win competitions.

23
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:14,610
If you're open,
you want to engage in creative activity.

24
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,950
If you're high in neuroticism,
you want security.

25
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,980
Okay?
So those are all sources of potential 

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,020
motivation that you could draw on that 
you could tailor to your own,

27
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,580
you know,
your own personality.

28
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,850
But then there are dimensions that you 
want to consider your life across.

29
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:29,070
And so we ask people about,
well,

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,250
you know,
if you could have your life the way you 

31
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,691
wanted it in three to five years,
if you were taking care of yourself 

32
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:35,691
properly,
you know,

33
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:36,540
what would you want from your 
friendships?

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,460
What would you want from your intimate 
relationship?

35
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,110
How would you like to structure your 
family?

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,050
What do you want for your career?
Well,

37
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,100
how are you going to use your time 
outside of your job and how are you 

38
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,430
going to regulate your mental,
physical,

39
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,600
mental,
and physical health,

40
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,640
and maybe also your drug and alcohol 
use.

41
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:52,890
Because that's,
that's a good place to Auger down,

42
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,910
you know,
because alcoholism,

43
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:54,990
for example,
wipes out,

44
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,790
you know,
five to 10 percent of people,

45
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:00,180
so you want to keep that under control 
and then,

46
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,030
and then so maybe you know,
you,

47
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:08,070
you develop a vision of what your life,
what you would like your life to be and 

48
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,051
that associates the so the goal,
once the goal is established and then 

49
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:17,541
you break down the goal into micro 
processes that you could implement the 

50
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:21,741
microprocesses become rewarding in 
proportion in relation to there a causal

51
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,070
association with the goal and that 
tangles in your,

52
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,810
your incentive reward system.

53
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,060
We talked about the dopaminergic 
incentive reward system and that's the 

54
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,920
thing that keeps you moving forward and 
the way it works is that it works better

55
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,310
if it produces positive emotion.
When it can see you moving towards a 

56
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,190
valued goal,
okay,

57
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:46,191
well what's the implication of that?
Better have a valued goal because 

58
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:50,151
otherwise you can't get any positive 
motivation working out and so the more 

59
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:53,721
valuable the goal in principle,
the more the micro processes associated 

60
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:56,040
with that goal start to take on a 
positive charge.

61
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,310
And so what that means is while you get 
up in the morning and you're excited 

62
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:01,310
about the day,
you're ready to go,

63
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,940
and so as far as I can tell,
what you do is you specify your longterm

64
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,960
ideal.
Maybe you also specify a place you want 

65
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,081
to stay the hell away from so that 
you're terrified to fail as well as 

66
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:13,081
excited about succeeding.

67
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:15,880
Because that's also useful.
You specify your goal.

68
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,220
You do that,
you do that in some sense as a unique 

69
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,220
individual.
You want.

70
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,020
You want to specify goals that make you 
say,

71
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,990
Oh,
if that could happen as a consequence of

72
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,210
my efforts,
it would clearly be worthwhile.

73
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,000
Because the question always is,
why do something?

74
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,390
Because doing nothing is easy.
You just sit there and you don't do 

75
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,641
anything that's real easy.
The question is why would you ever do 

76
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:41,701
anything?
And the answer that has to be because 

77
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:42,400
you've determined by some means that 
it's worthwhile.

78
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,440
And then the next question might be,
well,

79
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,510
where should you look for worthwhile 
things?

80
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:49,030
And one would be while you can consult 
your own temperament,

81
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,940
and the other would be,
while you kind of look at how,

82
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,800
look at what it is that people accrue 
that's valuable across the lifespan.

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,050
Look,
look what you do,

84
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:04,051
a structural analysis of the 
subcomponents of human existence and 

85
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:04,051
already did that.

86
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,100
You need a family,
you need friends,

87
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,600
like you don't need to have all of these
things,

88
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,610
but you better have most of them.
Family,

89
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:10,570
friends,
career,

90
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,680
educational goals,
plans for time outside of work,

91
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,470
attention to your mental and physical 
health,

92
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:18,610
etc.
You know those are,

93
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:23,670
that's what life is about.
And if You don't have any of those 

94
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,361
things,
well then all you've got left is misery 

95
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:27,361
and suffering.
So that's,

96
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:29,170
that's a bad,
that's a bad deal for you.

97
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,200
So,
so once you,

98
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,050
once you set up that goal structure,
let's say,

99
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:37,510
and that's really in many,
in many ways,

100
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:42,511
that's what you should be doing at 
universities is that's exactly what you 

101
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:45,601
should be doing,
is trying to figure out who it is that 

102
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:46,120
you're trying to be.
Right?

103
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,330
And you aim at that and then use 
everything you learned as a means of 

104
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,900
building that person that you want to 
be.

105
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,900
And and I really mean want to be.
I don't mean should be even those 

106
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,861
things.
Those things are going to overlap and 

107
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:02,170
it's important to distinguish between 
those because that's partly,

108
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:04,390
and this is back down to the micro 
routine analysis.

109
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:05,110
So I started saying,
well,

110
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:06,820
you're going to try to make yourself 
more industrious.

111
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,770
Okay?
Number one,

112
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,790
specify your damn goals because how are 
you going to hit something if you don't 

113
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,910
know what it is that isn't going to 
happen?

114
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,180
And often people won't specify their 
goals too because they don't like to 

115
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,151
specify conditions for failure.
So if you keep yourself all vague and 

116
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:22,300
foggy,
which is real easy because that's just a

117
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,210
matter of not doing as well,
then you don't know when you fail.

118
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,800
And people might say,
well,

119
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:29,320
I really don't want to know when I fail 
because that's painful,

120
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,140
so I'll keep myself blind about when I 
fail.

121
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,300
ThAt's fine,
except you'll fail all the time.

122
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:39,301
Then you just won't know it until you 
failed so badly that you're done and 

123
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:40,810
that can easily happen by the time 
you're 40,

124
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,590
so,
so I would recommend that you don't let 

125
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:46,590
that happen.
So that's willful blindness,

126
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,361
right?
You could have known but you chose not 

127
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:51,361
to.
Okay.

128
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:51,640
So once you get your goal structure set 
up,

129
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:52,210
you think,
okay,

130
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:57,211
if I could have this life looks like 
that might be worth living despite the 

131
00:05:57,211 --> 00:05:57,500
fact that it's going to be,
you know,

132
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,100
anxiety provoking and threatening and 
there's going to be some suffering and 

133
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,831
loss involved in all of that.
Obviously the goal is to have a vision 

134
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:10,451
for your life such that all things 
considered that justifies your effort.

135
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,920
Okay,
so then what do you do?

136
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,320
Well then then you turn down to the 
micro routines.

137
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:16,790
It's like,
okay,

138
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,930
well this is what I'm aiming for.

139
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,230
How does that instantiate itself day to 
day,

140
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,550
week to week,
month to month.

141
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,000
And that's where something like a 
schedule can be unbelievably useful.

142
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,510
google calendar,
it's like make a damn schedule and stick

143
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,560
to it.
Okay.

144
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:33,800
So what's the rule with the schedule?
It's not a bloody prison.

145
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,260
That's the first thing that people do 
wrong.

146
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:36,530
He said,
well,

147
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:38,990
I don't like to follow a schedule.
It was like,

148
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,080
well,
what kind of schedule are you setting 

149
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,080
up?
Well,

150
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,080
I,
I have to do this.

151
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,330
Then I have to do this.
Then I have to do this,

152
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,870
and then I just go play video games 
because who wants to do all these things

153
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:49,820
that I have to do?
It's like wrong.

154
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,050
Set the damn schedule up so that you 
have the day you want.

155
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,760
That's the trick.
It's like,

156
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:56,930
okay,
I've got tomorrow.

157
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,140
If I was going to set it up so it was 
the best possible day I could have 

158
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,730
practically speaking,
what would it look like?

159
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Well then you schedule that and 
obviously there's a bit of 

160
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,150
responsibility that's going to go along 
with that because if you have any sense,

161
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,390
one of the things that you're going to 
insist upon is that at the end of the 

162
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,930
day,
you're not in worse shape than you were 

163
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:19,930
at the beginning of the day,
right?

164
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,430
Because that's a stupid day.
If you have a bunch of thoSe in a row,

165
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:27,431
you just dig,
dig yourself a hole and then you bury 

166
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:27,431
yourself in.
It's like,

167
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:28,280
sorry,
that's just not a good strategy,

168
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,830
bad strategy.
So maybe 20 percent of your day has to 

169
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,420
be responsibility and obligation or 
maybe it's more than that,

170
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,290
depending on how far behind you are,
but even that you can.

171
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,740
You can ask yourself,
okay,

172
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:43,610
well I've got these responsibilities.
I have to schedule the damn things in.

173
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,180
What's the right ratio of responsibility
to reward?

174
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:52,390
And you can ask yourself that just like 
you'd negotiate with someone who is 

175
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,390
working for you.

176
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,390
It'S like,
okay,

177
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,450
you got to work tomorrow.
Okay,

178
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:55,670
so I want you to work tomorrow.
And you might say,

179
00:07:55,671 --> 00:08:00,671
okay,
well what are you going to do for me 

180
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:00,671
that makes it likely that I'll work for 
you.

181
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:02,300
While you could ask yourself that,
you know,

182
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,380
maybe you do an hour of of 
responsibility and then you play a video

183
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:07,820
game for 15 minutes.
I don't know,

184
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,380
whatever turns your crank man,
but you know,

185
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,150
you have to negotiate with yourself and 
not tyrannized yourself.

186
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,420
Like you're negotiating with someone 
that you care for,

187
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:20,060
that you would like to be productive and
have a good life,

188
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:22,290
and that's how you make the schedule.
It's like,

189
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,690
and then you look at the day and you 
think,

190
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:24,680
well,
if I had that day,

191
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:26,600
that'd be good.
Great.

192
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,560
You know,
and you,

193
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,620
you're useless and horrible,
so you'll probably only hit it with 

194
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,800
about 70 percent accuracy,
but that beats the hell out of zero.

195
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,520
Right?
And if you hit it even with 50 percent 

196
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,520
accuracy,
another rule is well,

197
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,960
aim for 51 percent the next week or 50 
and a half percent for god's sake or 

198
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,090
because you're,
you're going to hit that position where 

199
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,680
things start to loop back positively in 
spiral you upward and so,

200
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,340
so that's one way that you can work on 
your conscientiousness is a plan a life 

201
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,161
you'd like to have and you do that 
partly by referring to social norms.

202
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,800
That's more or less rescuing your father
from the belly of the whale.

203
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:09,801
But the way other way you do that is by 
having a little conversation with 

204
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:11,490
yourself about as if you don't really 
know who you are,

205
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:13,680
because you know what you're like.
You won't do what you're told,

206
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,080
you won't do what you tell yourself to 
do.

207
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,350
You must have noticed that it's like 
you're a bad employee and a worse boss 

208
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,850
and both of those work for you.

209
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,180
You don't know what you want to do.
And then when you tell yourself what to 

210
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,180
do,
you don't do it anyways.

211
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,000
You should fire yourself and find 
someone else to beat.

212
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,740
But,
but you know what?

213
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,030
My point is that you have to understand 
that you're not your own servant,

214
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:41,031
so to speak.
You're someone that you have to 

215
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:42,621
negotiate with and someone that you want
to present the opportunity of having a 

216
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:48,651
good life too.
And that's hard for people because they 

217
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:48,780
don't like themselves very much.
So you know,

218
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:53,781
they're always like cracking the whip 
and then procrastinating and cracking 

219
00:09:53,781 --> 00:09:54,210
the whip and then procrastinating.
And it's like,

220
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,240
god,
it's so boring and such a pathetic way 

221
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,331
of spending your time.
And you know what that's like because 

222
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:04,281
you probably waste like six hours a day 
and I think we did an economic 

223
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:04,590
calculation about that awhile back,
right?

224
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,660
Your time is probably worth 50 bucks an 
hour,

225
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,190
something like that.
I mean,

226
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,800
you're not getting paid that now,
but you're young.

227
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,070
And so this is investment time and what 
you do now is going to multiply its 

228
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,650
effects in the future.
so,

229
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,830
so let's say it's 50 bucks an hour,
which is perfectly reasonable.

230
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:22,140
So if you waste six hours a day and you 
are,

231
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,620
then you're wasting about $2,000
a week or about $100,000

232
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:27,210
a year.
So like go ahead.

233
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,190
But that's what it's costing you every 
hour.

234
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,380
And you need to know what your damn time
is worth.

235
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,780
So let's say it's not 50 bucks,
it's 30,

236
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,820
whatever.
Maybe it's 100,

237
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:40,821
it's somewhere in that range.
One of the things you should be asking 

238
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:41,250
yourself is when you spend an hour was 
that,

239
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:46,251
well,
what have I paid someone 50 bucks to 

240
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:46,350
have had that hour?
And if the answer is no,

241
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:46,980
it's like,
well,

242
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,780
maybe you should do something else with 
your time.

243
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,200
And it depends on whether or not you 
think that your time is worthwhile.

244
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,980
But the funny thing about not assuming 
that is if you assume your time isn't 

245
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,311
worthwhile,
what happens is you don't just sit 

246
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:03,060
around sort of randomly in a state of 
responsibility list bliss.

247
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,360
What you do is you suffer existentially.
And so that seems like a stupid 

248
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:08,850
solution.
