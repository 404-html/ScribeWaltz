1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,110
Okay,
so your association task,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,490
the principle is this word association 
game.

3
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:09,240
It's actually predicated,
I would say on psychoanalytic ideas,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,600
most particularly on union ideas because
young development association tests 

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:14,600
many,
many,

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,041
many years ago,
but it purports to investigate whether 

7
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,840
you are unconsciously bias towards one 
group against another group.

8
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:23,540
Could be gender,
could be ethnicity,

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,290
could be race,
could be attractiveness,

10
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,550
whatever.
But the problem is is that when you give

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,180
the same person that damn it twice,
they don't get the same results.

12
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:36,870
So there's a rule for diagnostic tasks 
and the rule is the reliability test,

13
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:41,871
retest reliability has to exceed 
something like point eight or point 

14
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:42,510
nine,
point eight at least.

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,030
So the big five does that.
Iq tests do that,

16
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:50,031
but there's a dam a,
there's damn few tasks that passed that 

17
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:52,800
reliability criteria and the it is the 
only reliable,

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,500
I don't remember precisely,
but I think it's about point five,

19
00:00:55,501 --> 00:01:00,501
which isn't even,
it's not even near close enough to be 

20
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:00,501
used as a diagnostic test.

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,090
Plus it's not valid.
So what does that mean?

22
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,000
Well,
let's say I assess your unconscious bias

23
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:07,920
and give you a diagnosis.
Well,

24
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:10,440
there's no evidence that it predicts 
your behavior,

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,330
so.
So what?

26
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,310
What good is it?
What good is it?

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,610
Well,
it's good if you want people to send you

28
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:22,611
to retraining exercises so that you can 
have your perceptions adjusted in the 

29
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:27,051
direction that your organization in the 
state thinks is proper and that's 

30
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:30,801
happening everywhere.
I got letters this week already for 

31
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:33,051
people at CBC.
It's becoming mandatory there at St 

32
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,620
Mike's Hospital,
same thing and they've decided that all 

33
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,060
of their micro institutions within the 
hospital will be equitable.

34
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:42,960
There'll be 50 percent women and 50 
percent men at every single level of the

35
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:46,200
organization or the organization is 
corrupt and oppressive.

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,710
It's like it's that.
It's spreading so fast you can't believe

37
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:55,711
that.
I wrote Mazur Anthony Greenwald 

38
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:55,711
yesterday.

39
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:56,100
I hadn't set it off to some of my 
colleagues say,

40
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,190
are you going to come out and make a 
public statement about the fact that 

41
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,761
your damn test is being used by 
pathological people for nefarious 

42
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:05,760
purposes?
It's like,

43
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:10,761
well,
we'll see what they have to say about 

44
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:10,761
that.
I was a bit more polite in my letters,

45
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:15,350
but there's no excuse for it.
There's absolutely no excuse for it and 

46
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,831
as far as I'm concerned,
it's part of the broader corruption of 

47
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:19,470
social psychology.
You guys may know or may not.

48
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:24,471
The social psychology has been rife with
with controversy and scandal over the 

49
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:30,141
last three or four years and a big part 
of the reason for that is it's damn 

50
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:33,680
corrupt.
Discipline and that use of the iat for 

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:33,930
political reasons is a perfect example 
of that.

52
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,470
There is no excuse for it and the people
at St Mike's,

53
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:37,980
you know,
they say,

54
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:40,200
well,
this is scientifically validated.

55
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,040
It's like,
no,

56
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:46,041
it's not and worse.
Let's say you do have unconscious bias 

57
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,630
just for the sake of argument and you 
could measure it reliably,

58
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,240
which you can't,
and then it was valid,

59
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,360
which it isn't.
Let's say all of those things were in 

60
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,121
case there's no evidence whatsoever that
those damn on unconscious bias training 

61
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:01,180
programs,
retraining programs have the effect that

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,240
they're supposed to have and there's 
some evidence that they actually have 

63
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,511
the reverse effect and maybe that's 
because people don't really like being 

64
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:12,811
marched off to reeducation by their 
employers after they've been diagnosed 

65
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:15,010
as racist.
Even if there's no evidence that they in

66
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:20,011
fact are so,
it's an absolute misuse of psychology 

67
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:22,450
and it's politically motivated.
It's politically motivated.

68
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,450
It's an assault on freedom.
Anyways,

69
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,870
I made those two videos and I took,
tried to take the HR and equity people 

70
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,760
at uft to task because they made that 
training mandatory for their hr people.

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,760
I thought,
you don't have the right as an employer 

72
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,280
to invade the unconscious structures of 
your employee's minds and alter their 

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,180
political perspective.
Even though you can't do it.

74
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,600
You don't have the right to do that and 
to think about it as something you 

75
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:48,600
should do.
As a matter of course,

76
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,581
as part of your ethical duty is you 
really want that.

77
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,950
You really want that.
That's what you want your employers to 

78
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,441
be able to do.
Figure out independently of your 

79
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:05,461
behavior whether or not you're a racist 
or classist or or a misogynist or 

80
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:10,390
whatever that happens to be and you 
really think that the bureaucrats at the

81
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:11,680
university,
for example,

82
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:17,070
or bureaucrats anywhere for that matter 
are actually capable and qualified of 

83
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,961
doing such a thing properly.
It doing far more damage than than any 

84
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:21,961
possible.
Good.
