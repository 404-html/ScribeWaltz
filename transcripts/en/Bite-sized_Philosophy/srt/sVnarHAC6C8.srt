1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,500
Rule number 11,
do not bother children when they are 

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:05,830
skateboarding.
That's a very specific one.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,610
Yeah,
it is.

4
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:08,120
Well,
that's a,

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,030
that's an essay about masculinity 
mostly.

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,980
You know,
I used to watch kids skateboard on St 

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,980
George Street,
which is kind of cool because obviously 

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,740
St George is the dragon slayer.
That's the street I work on,

9
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:24,500
which I think is quite funny.
And anyways,

10
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,270
these kids used to,
you know,

11
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:28,430
they're teenagers,
young teenagers.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,880
We had these long bar hand railings 
going down some shallow stairs,

13
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:39,041
but a fairly good flight to them and 
they would board slide down these 

14
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:39,041
rentals.
It's crazy.

15
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,610
It's,
it's concrete that's pebbled.

16
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,760
It's like you don't want to land on.

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,100
You probably heard a lot of bones 
crunching over the years watching them.

18
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:45,370
It's like,

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,710
you know,
but they didn't have much protective 

20
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,731
gear on and you know,
and eventually the university put up 

21
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:57,830
things to stop them from doing this,
which I complained about in this chapter

22
00:00:57,831 --> 00:01:02,210
for a bunch of reasons.
But like I liked watching those kids.

23
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:07,211
I like watching skateboarders do those 
crazy things because they're trying to 

24
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:09,710
become competent.
Like in there they're facing danger.

25
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:11,330
They don't want the damn protective 
gear,

26
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:13,970
like sometimes it's just stupidity.
It's like where a damn helmet,

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,490
you know,
but sometimes it's not.

28
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:17,210
It's like,
no,

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,220
I don't want to wear a helmet.
I want to expose myself to this danger.

30
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:24,020
It's not that I'm stupid.
Maybe it is,

31
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,280
you know,
I'm just being careless,

32
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,200
but maybe it's not.
It's like,

33
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,450
no,
I'm facing the danger.

34
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:34,451
I'm trying to master it.
And if you watch kids board slide down 

35
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:37,571
like handrails.
If you don't think that that's 

36
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:37,970
courageous than your.
And maybe stupid.

37
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,520
Those two things aren't so easy to 
distinguish,

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,970
but it's brave and when they do it,
it's like amazing.

39
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,440
It's,
it's impossible to do that.

40
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:47,330
You jump in the air,
you grab your skateboard,

41
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,660
you balance on this stupid rail,
you slide for 20 feet and the,

42
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,970
you know,
the price for failure as well.

43
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:55,880
You do the splits on the rail.
That's not fun.

44
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,980
You know,
or you landed

45
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,420
the first one that can change your 
masculinity.

46
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,530
Masculinity like that.

47
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,750
Yeah.
And so like,

48
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,660
and the kids are often shooed away.
It's like,

49
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,780
wait a sec there.
They're practicing being courageous.

50
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:13,560
They're practicing mastering something 
in the face of danger,

51
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,060
you know,
and a lot of the rebellious behavior of 

52
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,711
young men in particular,
which is very frowned upon in the 

53
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:23,190
schools.
It's like that's toxic masculinity.

54
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:24,300
You know,
that horrid,

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,310
horrid phrase.
It's like,

56
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,360
leave those damn kids alone.
Let them like.

57
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,260
Another thing I referred to in that 
chapter is about 10 years ago in 

58
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,531
Toronto,
they changed the insurance rules 

59
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:42,051
governing the playgrounds and parents 
had raised money for these damn 

60
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:42,150
playground,
so there's nothing wrong with them.

61
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,440
They took them all out the whole city,
like two weeks before school started.

62
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,570
There was nothing but dirt and gravel.

63
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,320
What happens to her and rubber enough or
they weren't bouncy enough,

64
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,300
they were too unsafe.
Who knows?

65
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,270
Who knows?
Swap.

66
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,980
There was nothing wrong with them.
Well then the kids were.

67
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,910
I saw the kids on top of the school 
because they needed some danger.

68
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,730
We know that kids on playground 
equipment,

69
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:09,820
they will push to the limit of their 
ability.

70
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,780
That's what you see what you like.
When you go see a sport like gymnastics,

71
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,150
know what you think.
Go see a gymnast and like the gymnast 

72
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,950
does a flawless routine and like 
everybody claps like Matt and you know,

73
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,120
the judges say nine point nine and it's,
it's,

74
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,470
and then the next person comes up and 
they're screwed.

75
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:30,430
It's like nine point nine was basically 
perfect.

76
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,570
How can you do better than perfect?
And then they do it and,

77
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:39,610
and,
and you can do better than perfect 

78
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:39,610
because.
So the person is like,

79
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,620
they're on the edge and they go out 
there and you know,

80
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:46,621
you watch them,
you feel it in your body because you're 

81
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:46,621
mimicking them physiologically.

82
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:51,030
You see that everything they do is that 
much farther out into chaos than 

83
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:53,020
anything they've ever done.
Right?

84
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:56,320
They're pushing themselves to the 
absolute limit of their ability.

85
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,470
And everyone's like this because you 
tell with every gesture that they're 

86
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,891
that close to making a mistake.
And so they've taken this courageous 

87
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:08,941
step beyond their competence and put 
everything on the line and that 

88
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:10,810
celebrate in that.
And then when they land,

89
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,210
they land in a way that's unlike 
perfect.

90
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,560
It's perfect.
Plus.

91
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,650
And everybody immediately leapt to their
feet and like they get a chill right and

92
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,880
it's the same chill.
Your hair stands on end.

93
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,110
It's the same cil that a mouse has when 
it looks at a wolf the most puffs up.

94
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,140
It's all.
And so what you've just seen is all 

95
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,950
inspiring because you've seen someone 
courageously move past perfection into 

96
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,110
the unknown and,
and not only knowable themselves more,

97
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,380
but to ennoble humanity itself.
And our partner your feet.

98
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,460
It's like,
yes.

99
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,140
And then it's tens,
right?

100
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,750
It's tens,
they win the gold and it's like,

101
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,500
well everyone knows what that's like.
It's like a great musical performance 

102
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,651
and that's,
that's been in that place where 

103
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:55,651
everything lines up better than perfect.
