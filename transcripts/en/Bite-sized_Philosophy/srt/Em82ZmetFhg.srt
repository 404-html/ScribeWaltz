1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,940
One of the things that's quite 
interesting about the gulag camps,

2
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:07,941
and this is something that's very 
relevant to understanding of modern 

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,911
Russia,
is that so ordinary criminals were put 

4
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:10,911
into the camps and so were political 
prisoners,

5
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,600
prisoners,
but the ordinary criminals,

6
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:14,460
and so those would be rapists and 
murderers,

7
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:19,461
let's say,
as well as thieves who were engaged in 

8
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:22,730
theft as an occupation.
Those were regarded by the Soviets as 

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,451
socially friendly elements,
and the reason for that was that they 

10
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:30,351
assume that the reason that these people
had turned to crime was because the 

11
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:33,660
approach of the oppressive nature of the
previous czarist slash capitalist system

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,170
and that the only reason that these 
criminals existed was because they had 

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,291
been oppressed.
They were oppressed victims of that 

14
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,471
system.
And so one of the convenient 

15
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:47,810
consequences of that absolutely insane 
doctrine was that the Soviets put the 

16
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:51,510
ordinary criminals in charge of the 
camps and these were very,

17
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:53,400
very seriously bad people.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,760
And so you could imagine the way that 
they treated the political prisoners who

19
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:59,580
were regarded as socially hostile 
elements.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,030
Sometimes because of their own 
hypothetically traitorous acts,

21
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:08,031
but more often merely as a consequence 
of their racial or ethnic identity or 

22
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:13,041
the fact that they were related by birth
to say people who had been successful 

23
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,760
under the previous system,
so who had any,

24
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,030
any association with nobility or any 
association with what were known as the 

25
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,961
Kulaks who were the only successful 
class of former peasants in the Soviet 

26
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:26,880
Union because they were regarded as 
privileged.

27
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,160
You may have heard that word more 
recently.

28
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,850
They were regarded as privileged and 
therefore as enemies of the state,

29
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:36,000
and it didn't matter if it was your 
father or your grandfather or your great

30
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,770
grandfather who happened to be 
privileged,

31
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:42,771
but the mere fact that you were a member
of that group was sufficient reason to 

32
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:43,740
put you into a camp.

33
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,100
And we're talking hundreds of thousands 
or perhaps millions of people who 

34
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,460
underwent that fate.
And so the idea and the Soviet Union was

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,070
just because you were the member of a 
class.

36
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,040
Even as a consequence of your familial 
association.

37
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,510
You were immediately sufficiently guilty
to be put into a camp and punished.

38
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:05,511
And the.
And the terms for the camps were often 

39
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:05,511
10 years,
15 years long,

40
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:08,070
and if you were very fortunate,
you got to have two or three of those.

41
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:13,040
So the Soviets really instant 
implemented and,

42
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:18,041
and perfected the idea of class and if 
this is based guilt and it's a very bad 

43
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:23,631
road to walk down and it's something 
that we're very much engaged in at the 

44
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:27,231
moment because there's discussion 
everywhere in North America now about 

45
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,580
the idea of while race predicated guilt 
for example,

46
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,820
and ethnic predicated guilt and some 
very bad idea to classify an entire 

47
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,310
group of people as guilty of anything 
based on their group membership.

48
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,970
So these,
these sorts of things are things we 

49
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:43,970
haven't yet learned and certainly should
have.
