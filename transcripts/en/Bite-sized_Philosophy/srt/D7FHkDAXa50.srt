1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,600
Now I want to read you a story.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,670
All right,
so let me give you a little background 

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,921
to this story.
This story popped into my head in one 

4
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:14,470
chunk,
like complete,

5
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:19,471
which I thought was kind of interesting,
but it was also a story that emerged in 

6
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:25,141
solution to a problem I'd been thinking 
about for a long time because I was 

7
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:26,020
dealing with this guy who didn't want to
grow up.

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,350
So he's caught in a kind of Peter Pan 
Situation and Peter Pan Pan means 

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:31,350
everything.
Hey,

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,241
pan,
like pantheistic and Peter Pan is a 

11
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:36,760
child who won't grow up.
Now he's magical.

12
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:37,360
Well,
okay,

13
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:39,160
fine.
Children live in a magical world,

14
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:41,020
right?
They're rife with possibility.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,690
He's magical.
He doesn't want to grow up.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
So he lives in Neverland with the lost 
boys.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,070
Neverland doesn't really exist in the 
lost boys are obviously boys who haven't

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,460
managed to establish some mode of big 
and he's in constant battle with Captain

19
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,840
Hook and captain hook's a tyrant,
right?

20
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:02,650
A pirate,
a negative manifestation of the negative

21
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:07,651
archetype of social order.
And Captain Kirk is always fighting 

22
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,431
Peter Pan Because Peter Pan Represents 
childhood and vulnerability and he 

23
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:15,481
doesn't want to be vulnerable,
so they're locked in this sort of 

24
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,731
eternal battle and lots of people,
I think more commonly men but not 

25
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:23,380
necessarily get caught in this Peter Pan
Problem.

26
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,240
So I was dealing with

27
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,650
person who was caught in this situation,
didn't want to grow up,

28
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:32,390
wouldn't sacrifice childhood.

29
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,300
And so this story popped into my head.
It's called Cock-a-doodle-doo.

30
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,460
Once upon a time there was a man who had
a long,

31
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:46,461
hard journey ahead of him.
He was trudging along the way over 

32
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:50,031
boulders and through brushes when he saw
a little shiny known with big white 

33
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:50,940
teeth in the block to pay sitting by the
side of the road,

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,850
he was drumming on a log with two white 
bones and humming oddly to himself.

35
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,970
A little gnome said,
John,

36
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:02,940
why work so hard?
Why I walked so fast?

37
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,070
Who knows if you'll ever get there?
Anyway,

38
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,770
come over here.
I have something to show you.

39
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,280
So John Walked off the road.
He was sick of walking anyway because 

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,330
people kept throwing sticks and stones.
Adam little gnome said,

41
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,800
I have a shiny red jewel that I would 
like to sell you cheap.

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Here it is,
and for beneath his cloak he pulled the 

43
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,851
biggest ruby that the man I'd ever seen.
It must've weighed 100 pounds and it's 

44
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:29,130
shine like the sun.

45
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,620
The gnome said,
do you like it?

46
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,370
It's an enchanted stone.
What will you offer me for it?

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,490
And the man said,
I don't have much,

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,400
much money,
but I'll give you everything I have the 

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,890
no look displeased.
So John added,

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,880
or I could pay some more monthly.
So the GNOME excepted.

51
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,020
Fair enough.
Buy Now.

52
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,450
Pay later.
Sounds good for me.

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,840
I'm all for the installment plan.
So the man gave him all his money and 

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,710
promise to pay the rest.
Later,

55
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,050
and the gnome walk back into the Bush by
the road,

56
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,180
clacking his teeth and giggling and 
twitching.

57
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,920
The more of the man thought about this 
ruby and the great deal he got,

58
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,890
the happier he became.
He started back on the road with a light

59
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:16,891
heart,
but soon discovered that he couldn't 

60
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:17,080
make much progress because 100 pounds 
was a lot to carry.

61
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,440
He said to himself,
why continue anyways,

62
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,490
I have what I want.

63
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,760
I'll just stand here holding my ruby and
when people walk by they can see how 

64
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,160
well I've already done,
so he stopped a little while.

65
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:32,530
One of his little while later,
one of his friends came along,

66
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:34,370
so I'm standing there,
he's fair,

67
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:35,740
and said,
John,

68
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,950
why don't you come along with me?
I've just opened a new business and I 

69
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,710
could really use some help.
Come along quick.

70
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,330
It will be opening soon.
Joe,

71
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,690
and thought that sounded good,
but his friend was in a hurry besides 

72
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,970
couldn't even see the ruby.
How could he speed along beside him?

73
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,090
Where would he put his jewel?
So he said,

74
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:56,890
thanks,
but I have to take care of my jewel.

75
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,070
Maybe I'll see you later.
His friend looked at him like he was 

76
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,981
crazy,
but he was trying to get somewhere 

77
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:04,981
quick,
so it just shrugged a bit and said,

78
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:04,981
okay,
John,

79
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,010
see you later.

80
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,310
Then he sped on down the road.
A little while later.

81
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:11,050
Another friend came by and he said,
John,

82
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,600
nice to see you.
I'm going back to school.

83
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,520
There are lots of wonderful things to 
learn,

84
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,210
great things to do.
The world is full of unsolved problems.

85
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,060
I could use some company.
What would you like to come along?

86
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,110
John Thought that sounded pretty good,
but this friend who looked like he was 

87
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,110
in a hurry.
You sorry.

88
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,100
Started standing beside the road,
holding the jewel was tiring and he 

89
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,280
needed all the energy ad for that.
So he said to his friend,

90
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,890
thanks,
but I have to take care of my jewel.

91
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,040
Isn't it beautiful?
Maybe I'll see you later.

92
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,140
His friend looked at him like he was 
crazy,

93
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,970
but he was trying to get somewhere 
quick,

94
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,320
so he just shrugged and said,
hope.

95
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:47,170
Everything goes all right with you.
See you later.

96
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,970
Many friends came and went in the years,
went by,

97
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,360
the jewel got heavier and heavier,
but the man God more and more attached 

98
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,171
to it.
The only thing was nobody seemed to 

99
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:03,841
notice how beautiful it was.
People would rush by and talk about 

100
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:07,111
their plans and nobody had a ruby as big
and nobody seemed likely to get A.

101
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,300
Ruby is big and you think that someone 
might've had said something like at 

102
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:12,950
least Nice Ruby,
John,

103
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,300
sure wish I had one like that,
but it never happened.

104
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,510
Then one day someone new came down the 
road.

105
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,270
He was bent over and he was thin and his
hair was gray.

106
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,540
Although he didn't look that old,
he was carrying a big dirty rock 

107
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,330
carefully in his arms and he wasn't 
making much progress.

108
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,040
The strange figure approached and 
glanced up at John and he grinned and 

109
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,740
said,
where are you standing there so stupidly

110
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:37,420
with a big ugly rock and you're tired.

111
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,700
Old Hands.
You look pretty daft.

112
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,970
I bet you wish you had a big ruby like 
the one I am carrying.

113
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,670
And John Thought,
this poor man is diluted.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,150
He's carrying a rock it desire.
You have the ruby.

115
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,500
So he said,
excuse me sir,

116
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:53,470
but you are sadly mistaken.
I'm the one with the jewel.

117
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,920
I met a little known by the side of the 
road and he sold it to me.

118
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,100
I'm still paying for it,
although not so very much.

119
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,360
You are carrying a rock.
The tired stranger looked annoyed.

120
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:06,800
He said,
I didn't know what game you're playing,

121
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:09,880
Mr you have a rock.
I have a jewel.

122
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,180
The little gnome you described sold it 
to me and he said it was the only one.

123
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,530
I've been carrying it for 20 years and 
I'll never let it go,

124
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,340
and John said,
but I'd been carrying mine for 20 years 

125
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:24,340
too.

126
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,210
It can be just a rock rocker.
Jewel on and on.

127
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:31,211
They argued,
suddenly out stepped a little gnome as 

128
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:31,670
if he'd never left.
Only this time he wasn't so little.

129
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,910
He was bigger and redder and menacing 
and his laugh sounded like the rattling 

130
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,330
of chains.
Quit arguing you too.

131
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,060
I've never seen a site quite so 
pathetic.

132
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,700
You're carrying rocks,
both of you,

133
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,390
and if you would have ever had the sense
to put them down for a second or two,

134
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,930
you would have seen that,
oh well,

135
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,810
at least you were diligent.
I played a mean trick.

136
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,800
I feel bad,
so I'm going to give you what you really

137
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:01,460
deserve.
Do you want what you really deserve?

138
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,520
And John and the thin stranger nodded 
eagerly.

139
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,580
Finally,
they thought you haven't seen anything 

140
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,310
yet.
Throw down your rocks,

141
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,680
so John and the thin stranger obeyed.
He trucked split down the middle of when

142
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:20,681
it hit the ground outflow to river of 
ravenous white worms which rushed 

143
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:24,941
towards the men and devoured them whole 
while they thrashed about and screamed 

144
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,400
soon.
Nothing was left except a leg bone from 

145
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,640
each.
The little gnome pick them up and walked

146
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:36,641
off the road.
He sat down by a hollow log and started 

147
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:40,331
to drop.
He drummed any waited and he hummed and 

148
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:44,201
odd little tune picture of food feeds 
the whole hungry clan,

149
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,950
the image of good mix.
The whole healthy man.

150
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,000
Why walk for miles?
Why do the work?

151
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,010
Just smile.
The smile,

152
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,150
success after all is a quirk.
Life isn't real.

153
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,240
That's the message I give.
It's easy that way.

154
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,340
Plus who wants to live?

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,110
So needless to say,
the guy that I was telling this story to

156
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,150
never listened to it and things.
You really didn't go well for him for a 

157
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,510
long,
long time and they really didn't go well

158
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:25,511
for him until he was willing to give up 
some of the things he was carrying 

159
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:25,820
along.
So he had acquired,

160
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:30,821
for example,
a number of things that he couldn't 

161
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:32,470
afford and the fact that he was carrying
them right,

162
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,580
paying for them month after month,
man,

163
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:39,790
he couldn't afford to get an education.
It was perfectly willing to sacrifice 

164
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,460
the possibility of getting an education 
for the image of success rather than the

165
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:44,420
reverse.
Right?

166
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,610
And he was completely irritated at the 
world because he had all these trappings

167
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:53,050
of success,
which no one he admired also admired and

168
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,060
he absolutely wasn't getting anywhere 
and he thought that was tremendously 

169
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,620
unfair.
But the truth of the matter was that how

170
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,370
do you put down what he was carrying for
even a moment?

171
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,130
Then he would have been able to get to 
where he wanted to go.

172
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,370
And that's a motif that succinctly and 
dramatically describes the necessity for

173
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,480
sacrifice.
