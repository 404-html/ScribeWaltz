1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,180
Okay,
so the question is why don't,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,460
why do people pursue rewards that don't 
produce this resonance?

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,360
They don't have a value hierarchy,
so pleasure island.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,320
It's a good example.
Those kids that were brought there were 

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,530
lost so they didn't.
They didn't have anywhere to go.

6
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:21,531
They didn't have an identity,
so they default to local pleasure and 

7
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:28,611
that's better than none.
Although the problem with local 

8
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:28,611
pleasure,
while as the narrative made clear,

9
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:33,501
is that you better look out if you're 
impulsive because it's going to kick 

10
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:37,251
back on Newhart,
and the reason is you're only 

11
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:38,150
considering the immediate timeframe,
and the problem is,

12
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:42,390
is that things propagate across all the 
timeframes and so just because something

13
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:44,220
works really well,
this second,

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,460
cocaine for example,
doesn't mean that it's a tenable 

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,091
solution to the class of all problems.
So usually often people pursue local 

16
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:58,740
pleasure because that's the best they 
can imagine.

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,950
It's the best they've been taught.
They don't see another alternative.

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,250
So it could be ignorance,
it can be they don't want to adopt the 

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,801
responsibility because part of the 
problem with working at every level of 

20
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:11,820
the hierarchy simultaneously is that 
it's,

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,820
it's,
well,

22
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,590
it's like dancing to a very complex 
waltz,

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,620
let's say.
You have to be paying attention to a 

24
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,070
very large number of things 
simultaneously and doing things right.

25
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:26,590
It requires responsibility.
And so you know,

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,790
that's.
It's a pain.

27
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,450
It's a weight.
Part of the reason people drink alcohol 

28
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:35,700
is to get rid of their responsibility.
I mean,

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,840
that's what you know,
you hear people drink because they have 

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:40,840
problems.
It's like,

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:40,840
yeah,
yeah,

32
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,320
no.
Some people drink because they're 

33
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,950
anxious and alcoholics drink because 
they're in withdrawal.

34
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,250
But young people drink because they're 
sick and tired of being responsible 

35
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:52,680
because it's annoying.
It's like,

36
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,670
so I'll drink enough.

37
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,090
I won't care about the medium to 
longterm consequences because alcohol,

38
00:01:57,091 --> 00:02:02,091
that's exactly what alcohol does.
It doesn't make you ignorant of the 

39
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:04,860
medium to longterm consequences,
but it makes you not care about them.

40
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,230
And partly it's because it dampens 
anxiety.

41
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,620
So it dampens anxiety,
leaves your positive emotion circuits 

42
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,340
intact.
So then you can go out there and do 

43
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:15,340
stupid,
fun things and that's like,

44
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,890
that's a party really.
Let's go do stupid fun things.

45
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,100
That's a party.
But the medium to longterm consequences 

46
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,870
are.
It's risky.

47
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,930
It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it,
but it's risky.

48
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,570
So yeah,
they don't know better.

49
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,290
That's the answer I would say.
So.
