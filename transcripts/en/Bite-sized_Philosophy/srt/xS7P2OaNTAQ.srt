1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,790
So in some sense there is a call to 
action within people now you know,

2
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:07,490
in any sort of quest story,
like the Hobbit,

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,160
let's say,
or the Lord of the rings,

4
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:11,450
for that matter.
You know,

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,360
the story always starts with a call to 
action,

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,250
right?
For some reason or another,

7
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:18,380
the little hobbit character,
which by the way is,

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,560
you know,
the hobbits live in this little 

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,121
protected place and they're not very big
and they're not very smart and they 

10
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:25,660
don't know about the wide world beyond 
them,

11
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:28,220
where the great forces of good and evil 
are at combat.

12
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:32,570
And one hobbit who's a little bit more 
adventurous than the rest gets called to

13
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:34,850
act,
gets called upon to act.

14
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:37,870
And in the Harvard stories,
it's usually the wizard who manages it,

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,910
right?
So it's a magical figure of some sort,

16
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:44,480
becomes extraordinarily wise and 
extraordinarily old who might as well be

17
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:46,520
gone for all intents and purposes,
who says,

18
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:51,521
you know,
it's time for you to go and become a 

19
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:51,521
thief.

20
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:51,521
Will.
That's what happens in the Hobbit,

21
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:55,870
right?
Because very weird thing because 

22
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,120
obviously that's Frodo,
right?

23
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,050
Photos,
the hobbit in,

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,120
in the Hobbit,
and Bilbo is the hobbit and the Lord of 

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,120
the rings.
If I remembered the other way around.

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,610
Bilbo is the poverty and the hobbit.
Fine,

27
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,400
Bilbo.
Okay,

28
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,190
so bill will gets called to action and 
he's gonna go.

29
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,880
He's gonna.
Go find a dragon while the dragon is the

30
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:18,881
same thing that swallowed Jonah.
It's the same story and the Jew and the 

31
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:19,790
dragon has a treasure,
which is a weird thing.

32
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,320
It's like what's up with dragons,
right?

33
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,360
What do they hoard?
Virgins.

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,330
That's the St George Story.
It's a very,

35
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:31,331
very old story or goal and that's weird 
behavior for a predatory lizard,

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,080
but anyways,
you accept that without any problem.

37
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:39,081
Of course in dragon lives underground in
a big mountain that was excavated by 

38
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:39,081
doors and sits on a treasure.

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,200
It's like we go to.
We don't have any problem with that 

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,200
idea.
Well,

41
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,360
why fate?
I mean really,

42
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,270
you really believe that announcer as 
well?

43
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:49,430
Well enough to read the damn book and to
make the.

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,640
I mean,
how many people went and watched the 

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Lord of the Rings?
How many people?

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,590
And think about it worldwide.
How much money did a Harry Potter 

47
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,190
generate?
You know,

48
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:06,191
I bet Harry Potter generated more money 
than the remaining steel mills in 

49
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:11,201
Britain.
If you calculated it across the amount 

50
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:13,040
of time since those stories emerged.
Right?

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,570
So of course there's a lizard in a 
predatory lizard and Harry Potter too.

52
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:22,571
It's the thing that skitters around 
underneath hogwarts and turns you to 

53
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:22,571
stone with the glance of it.
I owe.

54
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:27,070
And does that Lizard Hoard vergence?
Well,

55
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:32,071
what's the name of the woman that.
The girl that he kidnaps Jenny.

56
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,630
Right.
Okay.

57
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,560
What's the word?
Jenny from Virginia,

58
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,380
right.
Good.

59
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,960
Good.
She's Harry's first month interest and 

60
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,670
he rescues her from the damn snake and 
he gets parallels.

61
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:50,290
Won't paralyze,
wouldn't while he's doing it.

62
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,700
What rescue is Harry?

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,400
Phoenix?
Phoenix.

64
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,680
Okay.
So the six bites Harry.

65
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,630
And so he's going to die.
The Phoenix comes along.

66
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,630
Who owns the Phoenix?
Dumbledore.

67
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:05,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

68
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,450
What is the Phoenix do cries and cries 
into Harry's wounds.

69
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,910
Yes,
but what happens then?

70
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:17,911
What happens to Harry?
He comes back to life to read his death 

71
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:21,091
and Resurrection Story.
So the thing that's willing to die and 

72
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:23,260
resurrect is the thing that gets the 
virgin from the snake.

73
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,330
It's like,
does that make sense?

74
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,050
Well,
you think it makes sense even though you

75
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:34,051
don't really know why it makes sense.
And then what happens to the what adds 

76
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:37,141
to the Phoenix after does that Burns 
itself up into in a puff of flame and is

77
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,500
reborn.
So it's the story told twice.

78
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:46,501
The thing that dies in is reborn,
is the thing that conquers the 

79
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:50,260
serpentine and rescues the feminine 
roughly speaking.

80
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,610
So it's not gold in that situation,
but it doesn't matter.

81
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:56,710
It's the same story.
It's always the same story.

82
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,440
So,
and when you don't hear that story,

83
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:04,441
like when your culture is it providing 
you with rich stories of that sort that 

84
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:05,260
are derived directly from your 
tradition.

85
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,440
Somebody like an unemployed welfare 
mother in Britain has it popped up full 

86
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:15,601
fledged into her brilliant imagination 
and lays out seven books and makes 

87
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,080
herself more money than the queen.
Right?

88
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,890
Right.
And that,

89
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,210
you know,
it's a cinderella story.

90
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:22,780
It's a bloody amazing story.
And then there's all those books and all

91
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:24,580
those kids learn to read because of the 
books.

92
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:29,581
And then there's all those movies and 
everybody goes and sees them and no one 

93
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:32,611
notices that they don't know what the 
hell they're doing while they're doing 

94
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:32,830
it.
And it follows the same old story.
