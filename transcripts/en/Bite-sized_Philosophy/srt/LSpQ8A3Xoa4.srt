1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,570
Fully believed that the fundamental myth
of the human being was the myth and the 

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,070
myth from a broader perspective is a 
failed hero's story,

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,500
so the eatable myth is the myth of a man
who develops who grows up,

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,970
but then accidentally becomes too close 
to his mother,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,400
sleeps with her,
he doesn't know who she is,

6
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:26,970
and as a consequence blinds himself and 
there's a.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,750
there's a,
there's a warning about human 

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,590
development going wrong in that story 
and I think that Freud put his finger on

9
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:39,591
it extraordinarily well because human 
beings have a very long period of 

10
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:44,031
dependency and one of the things that 
you do see in clinical practice is that 

11
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:48,800
many people's problems are associated 
with their inability to break free of 

12
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:54,921
their family,
like they're consumed by the family 

13
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:54,921
drama,
right?

14
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,670
They can't get beyond what happened to 
them in their family.

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,290
They're stuck in the past.

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,400
It's,
and that's,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that's equivalent symbolically speaking,
you might say to the idea of being too 

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,630
close to your mother of,
of,

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,170
of the boundaries being improperly 
specified,

20
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:12,120
and that happens far more often than 
anyone would like to think.

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,420
As I said,
for I thought it was a universal,

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,180
but you see,
he had a different idea and his idea was

23
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,930
that it wasn't the failed hero story 
that was the universal human myth.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,310
It was the successful hero's story.
And that's a big difference.

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,640
I could seriously a big difference 
because the successful hero story is 

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,960
member in sleeping beauty.
You may remember this in the Disney 

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,541
movie,
the evil queen traps the prince in a 

28
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,030
dungeon and she's not gonna let them out
till he's old.

29
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:50,031
Right?
And so there's this comical scene where 

30
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:50,790
she's down in the dungeon,
he's all in chains and she's laughing at

31
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:55,791
him,
telling him what his future is going to 

32
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:55,791
be like.

33
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:56,490
She's quite evil and you know,
she,

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,520
she paints this wonderful picture of him
being freed in like 80 years and 

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,440
hobbling out of the castle on his,
his horse that's so old,

36
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:05,530
he can barely stand up in him with gray 
hair.

37
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:06,630
And,
and you know,

38
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:11,631
she,
she recites this story of his eventual 

39
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,920
triumphant departure from the castle as 
a old and decrepit man.

40
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:17,220
And she has a great laugh about it and 
it's nice.

41
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,570
You know,
it's a real punchy story.

42
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,670
It's really something wonderful for 
children,

43
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,770
that story and um,
he gets free of the,

44
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,730
of the shackles and the things that 
freedom or three little female ferries,

45
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,490
the positive aspect of the feminine that
frees him from the dungeon.

46
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,770
It's so.
It's very interesting and very accurate 

47
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,401
from a psychological perspective.
It's the negative element of the 

48
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:44,430
feminine that encapsulates him in the 
dungeon and it's the positive element of

49
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,510
the feminine that frees him.

50
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,720
And then he,
he has a queen.

51
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,420
The Evil Queen is not very happy when he
escapes.

52
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:56,421
You may remember that she stands on top 
of her castle tower and starts to spin 

53
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:57,870
off cosmic sparks.
I mean,

54
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:02,871
she's quite the creature in opt in flame
and then she turns into a dragon and she

55
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:07,981
then the prince has to fight with her in
order to make contact with sleeping 

56
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:13,651
beauty and an awakened her from her 
comatose existence as her unconscious 

57
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:19,951
existence and a wants a brilliant.
It's a brilliant representation of a 

58
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:25,030
successful hero myth.
He,

59
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,340
he doesn't end up staying in an unholy 
relationship with his mother.

60
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,620
Let's say he escapes and then conquers 
the worst thing that can be imagined and

61
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,490
is ennobled by that and that as a 
consequences able to wake the slumbering

62
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:50,491
feminine from its coma and that's a 
union story and that's the story that he

63
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:56,461
juxtaposed against Freud,
Freud thought of religious phenomena as 

64
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,480
part of an old cult tide.

65
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,930
That would be,
that would drown rationale rationality.

66
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,060
That's why Freud was so valiantly 
antireligious and you thought,

67
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,550
no,
it's not the case.

68
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,380
You're throwing the baby out with the 
bathwater.

69
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,650
There's something profound and central 
to the hero myth and union clinical work

70
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:24,631
is essentially the awakening of the hero
myth in the in the analysis and in the 

71
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,640
in the client or the patient to 
conceptualize yourself as that which can

72
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:35,641
confront chaos and triumph and that 
that's associated with an ennobling of 

73
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:39,100
the Sea of consciousness and the 
establishment of pop.

74
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,400
Proper positive relationships between 
male and female.

75
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,940
And you know,
I'm a skeptical person.

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm a very,
very skeptical person and I've tried 

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,771
with every trick.
I have to put a lever underneath young 

78
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:58,660
story and lifted up and disrupt it and 
I.

79
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,940
I can't do it.
I think he was right and that Freud was 

80
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:03,940
wrong.

81
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,360
I mean,
I have great respect for Freud.

82
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:07,360
I think he got the progam problem 
diagnosed very,

83
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:12,250
very nicely and in my clinical work,
I see the phenomena that Freud described

84
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,370
emerge continually,
constantly that the best.

85
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,580
If you're interested in that,
there's a documentary you should watch.

86
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:23,581
I may have mentioned it before.
I think it's the best documentary ever 

87
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:23,581
made.
Certainly the best one I've ever seen.

88
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:27,400
It's called crumb and it's about a 
underground cartoonists.

89
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:29,020
Robert Crumb,
who,

90
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,230
who was part of the hippie movement in,
although he hated hippies,

91
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,200
he was part of the hippie movement in,
in the sixties,

92
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:40,201
in San Francisco,
and started the entire underground 

93
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:41,680
comic.
What culture that that manifested itself

94
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:44,170
eventually in,
in graphic novels,

95
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,440
there's quite a significant figure from 
the perspective of popular art and a 

96
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,720
very,
very intelligent man and also I would 

97
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,391
say a hero,
although a very bent and depraved and 

98
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:57,391
warped one.

99
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:02,110
Someone very acutely aware of his own 
shadow and the documentary outlines his 

100
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,720
attempts to escape from his absolutely 
dreadful mother and the failure of his 

101
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:14,381
two brothers to do the same thing,
one of whom ended up as a street beggar 

102
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:18,491
in San Francisco and the other who drank
furniture Polish and died six months 

103
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:21,761
after the documentary was produced.
It's an unbelievably shocking 

104
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:25,450
documentary.
It's the only piece of film that I've 

105
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,880
ever seen that captures Friday and 
pathology.

106
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,820
I've never seen anything because he 
can't see it generally,

107
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:35,630
unless you're in a clinical situation,
unless you know the details of someone's

108
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:37,520
lives,
the personal intimate details,

109
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,760
you cannot communicate it,
but the documentary who made the film 

110
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,660
was Robert's way golf,
if I remember correctly,

111
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,840
was a friend of the crumbs and so he got
access in a way that no one else would 

112
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,760
have and they're also very forthright 
and forthcoming about their situation in

113
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:53,210
general.

114
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,270
I would highly recommend that it's.
It's a real punch.

115
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:01,390
If you want to know how a rapist thinks,
like if you actually want to know 

116
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,710
because maybe you don't want to know.
In fact,

117
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:06,080
you probably don't want to know,
right,

118
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:11,081
because do you really want to know that?
Because to understand that means to put 

119
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:11,570
yourself in that position and to 
understand it.

120
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,780
If you really want to know how a serial 
sexual Predator thinks and why,

121
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,300
if you watch crum and you pay attention,
you'll know and that's only a tiny bit 

122
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:26,240
of what the film has to offer.
It's really quite remarkable.
