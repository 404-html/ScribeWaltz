1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,490
Endosteal eskies book,
Crime and punishment.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,030
He has his main character.
[inaudible] cove decides that he's going

3
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:11,370
to commit a murder and he has very good 
justification for the murder.

4
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:13,170
And Dostoevsky is very good at this.
He,

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,470
he puts his characters into very,
very difficult moral situations and 

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:21,270
gives them full justification for 
pursuing the,

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,300
the,

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,640
pursuing the pathway that they're 
pursuing.

9
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:39,330
And so [inaudible] cove,
he's broke and starving.

10
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,420
He wants to go to law school.
His sister's about to prostitute herself

11
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:47,421
rough,
roughly speaking by marrying a guy that 

12
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:47,421
hates her,
that she hates and that,

13
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:49,200
and he has contempt for her,
at least acts in that manner.

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,090
He's trying to rescue his mother as 
well,

15
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:53,620
who's also in dire financial straits.
He,

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,810
he,
he,

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,840
he goes to a pawnbroker to pawn his 
meager position so that he can continue 

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,850
to scrape by.
And she has this nice,

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,220
uh,
I believe it's her niece that's not very

20
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:10,221
bright,
who she basically treats us as a slave 

21
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:10,221
in his horrible too.
And,

22
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:13,200
and so the care,
the pawn broker has this money risk.

23
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,450
All Niqab is in dire need.
He thinks,

24
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,810
look,
I'll just killer because why the hell 

25
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,420
not?
I'll take her money.

26
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,250
She's not doing any good with it 
anyways.

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,680
I'll free or niece who's just working as
a slave.

28
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,670
She's got all these other people tangled
up in her pawnbroker schemes.

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,880
All that will happen is the world will 
be a better place and the only thing 

30
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,141
that's holding me back is conventional.
Moral cowardice and Dostoevsky has his 

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,470
character in crime and punishment go 
through days,

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,500
hours,
hours and days and weeks of intense 

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,790
imagination about this rationalization,
about this,

34
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,510
trying to justify himself,
placing a metal outside,

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,570
placing him self outside the law so that
he can perpetrate this act and telling 

36
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,341
him self with all the best nihilistic 
arguments that the only possible thing 

37
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:08,601
that could be holding them back is an 
arbitrary sense of indoctrinated 

38
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:13,041
morality and so dusty Esky explorers 
that he does commit the murder and then 

39
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:17,031
of course all hell breaks loose because 
things don't necessarily turn out the 

40
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:17,031
way that you want.

41
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:17,190
He gets away with it.
However,

42
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,310
while he gets away with a technically 
because no one knows he did it,

43
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,970
but he doesn't get away with it in 
relationship to his own conscience and 

44
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,330
so that the rest of the book explores 
that well,

45
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:32,331
Dostoevsky,
I believe it was in crime and 

46
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:32,331
punishment,
although he makes the same point in many

47
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:37,041
of his books.
He makes a very fundamental point and 

48
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,861
this is the kind of point that that I 
think that people who haven't 

49
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:43,851
investigated these matters down this 
particularly particular literary and 

50
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:47,230
philosophical pathway,
never grappled with Dostoevsky,

51
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,280
said straightforwardly if there's no 
god,

52
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,700
so if there's no higher value,
let's say if there's no transcendent 

53
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,101
value,
then you can do whatever you want and 

54
00:02:58,101 --> 00:02:58,980
that's the question that he's 
investigating.

55
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,050
You see,
this is why I have such frustration say 

56
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,021
with people like Sam Harris,
this sort of radical atheists because 

57
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,950
they seem to think that once human 
beings abandoned their,

58
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,950
their grounding in the transcendent,
that the,

59
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,170
the plausible way forward is with a kind
of purest rationality that automatically

60
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,170
attributes to other people equivalent 
value.

61
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,250
It's like I just don't understand that.
If they believe that that's the rational

62
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:29,251
pathway,
what the hell is irrational about me 

63
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,831
getting exactly what I want from every 
one of you whenever I wanted at every 

64
00:03:31,831 --> 00:03:35,881
possible second,
why is that are irrational and how 

65
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:39,691
possibly is that more irrational than us
cooperating so we can both have a good 

66
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:42,880
time of it.
I don't understand that.

67
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,040
I mean it's as if the psychopathic 
tendency is irrational.

68
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,120
There's nothing irrational about it.
It's pure naked self interest.

69
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,210
How is that irrational?
I don't understand that.

70
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,380
Where?
Where's the pathway from rationality to 

71
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,520
to an egalitarianism virtue.
Why the hell not every man for himself 

72
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,160
and the devil take the hindmost?
It's a perfectly coherent philosophy and

73
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:11,290
is actually one that you can institute 
in the world with a fair bit of material

74
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:15,100
success if you want to do it so I don't 
see.

75
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,220
To me,
I think that that the universe that 

76
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,161
people like Dorkins and Harris inhabit 
is so intensely conditioned by 

77
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:29,170
mythological presuppositions that they 
take for granted.

78
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,000
The ethic that emerges out of that as if
it's just a given,

79
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,180
a rational given,
and this of course precisely niches,

80
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:40,180
observation as well as Dostoyevsky's.
That's Nietzsche's observation.

81
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,470
You don't get it.
The ethic that you think is normative is

82
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:49,471
a consequence of its of its of its 
nesting inside this tremendously lengthy

83
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:54,781
history,
much of which was expressed in 

84
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:55,240
mythological formulation.
You wipe that out.

85
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,270
You don't get to keep all the 
presuppositions and just assume that 

86
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,141
they're rationally axiomatic there.
The rational to make a rational 

87
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:09,121
argument,
you have to start with an initial 

88
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:11,640
proposition.
While the proposition that underlies 

89
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,600
western culture is that there's a 
transcendent morality.

90
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Now you can say,
that's a transcendent morality 

91
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,200
instantiated in the figure of God.
That's fine.

92
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,510
You can even call that a personification
of the morality if you want to,

93
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,680
if you.
If you don't want to move into a 

94
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,371
metaphysical space.
I'm not arguing for the existence of 

95
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,191
God.
I'm arguing that the ethic that drives 

96
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,770
our culture is predicated on the idea of
God and that you can't just take that 

97
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:42,931
idea away and expect the thing to remain
intact midair without any foundational 

98
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:43,390
support.
