1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,250
Does being around groups of people make 
you energetic or does it exhausts you,

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,180
and if,
if you're the sort of person that will 

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:11,180
go to a party and interact with 20 
people,

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,410
Indian and you have to go home and be by
yourself for like two weeks,

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,560
then you're introverted.
Introverts are exhausted by social 

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,320
interactions.
Extroverts are the opposite.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,300
They all,
they're,

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,510
they're,
they're,

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,240
they're energized by social interactions
and you know,

10
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:29,241
you might be in the middle so that you 
can take it or leave it with regards to 

11
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:32,961
social interactions,
but you're happy to go to them and 

12
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:32,961
you're happy to spend time by yourself.
But a real extrovert.

13
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:37,881
There'll be some of you in here.
How many of you can't stand spending 

14
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:37,881
time alone?

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,970
Okay,
so there's only two that will admit it.

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,400
Extroverts are more likely to admit that
sort of thing too,

17
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:49,401
by the way.
But then how many of you you like to 

18
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:49,401
spend time alone or would rather be 
alone?

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,590
Okay,
so there is a preponderance of 

20
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:54,590
introverts in this class is by the,
by,

21
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:54,590
by all appearances.
But that's a really,

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,110
that's a pretty canonical question for,
for extroversion versus introversion.

23
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,230
It's a very stable trait by the way.
It manifests itself early in life and 

24
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,140
it's stable across the age span,
not completely.

25
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,110
Introverts can learn to be extroverted,
to extroverts,

26
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:15,111
can learn to spend time on their own.
I think that actually your capacity to 

27
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:19,521
expand your ability past the initial 
constraints of your biological 

28
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:24,021
temperament is something like the 
development of character or wisdom you 

29
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:27,200
know.
So if you're an introvert by nature and 

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,961
you learn how to be extroverted,
then that expands your domain of 

31
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:29,961
competence.

32
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:30,990
And if you're extroverted,
you learned to be introverted.

33
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:35,991
The same thing,
but it's almost like imagine a 

34
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:35,991
distribution of extroversion,
introversion here,

35
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:40,700
extroversion here,
a normal distribution you're set when 

36
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:44,610
you're young at somewhere along that 
distribution with some range around it.

37
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,260
And I think what you do as you mature,
if you develop your skills as you expand

38
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:50,520
that range,
but you're set,

39
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,490
the place at which you're set doesn't 
move that much.

40
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,530
So okay,
so there's.

41
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,410
So you can think about them as 
subpersonalities.

42
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:00,150
You can think about them as frames of 
reference.

43
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:02,550
So frame of reference would be something
like,

44
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:03,630
well,
since you're extroverted,

45
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:05,840
you value being with people and so 
you're gonna.

46
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,890
Look at the world.
For example,

47
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:09,780
if you're extroverted,
you come into a room like this,

48
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:10,620
you think,
oh look,

49
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,500
it's a whole field of opportunity for 
social interactions.

50
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:18,501
And if you're introverted you think,
well maybe I'll go sit up in the corner 

51
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:18,501
and everybody leaves me the hell alone.
