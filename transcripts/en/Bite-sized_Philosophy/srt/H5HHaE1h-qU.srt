1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,390
You definitely have a responsibility to 
your partner and your children.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,540
Okay,
so your responsibility to your children 

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:11,540
as far as I'm concerned,
is don't.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,020
It's twofold.
One,

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,050
don't let your children do anything that
makes you dislike the and there's a 

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,080
corollary to that,
which is don't be an idiot.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,560
You know,
so that's partly why you need a partner 

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,511
because your partner has to tell you 
when your demands on your children are 

9
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:28,860
excessive because you're kind of,
you know,

10
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,900
you're not 100 percent oriented 
properly,

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,170
but still you're their target adult.
And so it's up to you to help them 

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,310
choose a path that makes you want them 
to be around right?

13
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,840
And that that's your critical 
responsibility and hopefully your enough

14
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:50,841
of an,
an analog of the broader community so 

15
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:51,690
that if they can figure out how to get 
along with you,

16
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:56,691
it radically increases the probability 
that the ability to get along with 

17
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:56,691
everyone.

18
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:59,490
So for example,
if you're playing with your children two

19
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:01,110
years old,
you,

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,290
you help them,
you encourage them to play in a manner 

21
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,080
that's fun.
And if you get that down,

22
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:09,860
then you know when you introduce them to
another child,

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,480
don't know how to play in a manner 
that's fun and so great,

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,600
you've solved the problem.
The problem is to get your child to 

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:18,840
enter into the collaborative social 
world.

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,320
And so yes,
you have a primary responsibility for 

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,320
that.
And then with regards to your partner,

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,610
here's something to think about with 
regards to rules.

29
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:32,611
So my wife and I have had this 
discussion many times and one of the 

30
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:35,481
discussions as well,
how are we to treat each other in 

31
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:35,481
public?
And it isn't.

32
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:39,890
Her name is Tammy.
The discussion isn't how should Jordan 

33
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,250
treat Tammy and public?
Or how should tammy treat Jordan?

34
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,330
That's not the discussion.

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,540
This isn't personal.
It's how should a wife treat her 

36
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,240
husband?
And how should a husband treat his wife?

37
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,330
It's impersonal and it's partly you 
don't put your partner down in public.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,870
Why?
Well,

39
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:57,150
it's not because you're hurting that 
persons feelings.

40
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:02,151
That's not why.
It's that you're denigrating the 

41
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:02,910
relationship that you are involuntarily.
You know,

42
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,220
I've some of the most painful days I've 
ever spent.

43
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,210
One night in particular I spent with a 
group of men who had been in therapy for

44
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,580
their marriage and who bloody well 
needed it.

45
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:16,581
I can tell you that,
and they spent their whole day 

46
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:19,671
complaining about their wives.
I could just made me sweat the whole 

47
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:19,671
day.
I thought,

48
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:21,750
I can't believe I'm here with you guys.
I can't tell you.

49
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,220
Why was it just,
you know,

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,920
it was just happenstance more than 
anything and I thought,

51
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,480
how can you be so damn dumb?

52
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,790
It's like it's certainly possible that 
you marriage barbara married barbarian 

53
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,951
witches fine,
but you don't have your so lacking in 

54
00:02:36,951 --> 00:02:38,880
sense that you would discuss that in 
public,

55
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,320
not noticing that you pick them.
So basically all you're doing is holding

56
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:46,050
up a sign and waving it constantly that 
says,

57
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,880
I'm an idiot.
I'm an idiot.

58
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,570
Right?
And so well,

59
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,010
Dr.
Responsibility,

60
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,940
you have a responsibility to those whom 
you love and are obligated to,

61
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,180
to ensure that they manifest themselves 
in a manner that's most beneficial to 

62
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,940
them over the long run.
Now you have the same responsibility.

63
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,940
I would say to yourself,
but you'll have blind spots.

64
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:16,390
Other people have to help you with that,
but so the rule is you know,

65
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,540
you don't let you,
don't you help your wife figure out how 

66
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,381
not to make a fool of herself in public 
and she extends to you the same 

67
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:29,851
courtesy,
and it's partly maintenance of the 

68
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:32,230
sacred nature of the relationship.
It has nothing to do with you or her.

69
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,170
Precisely.
It's broader and wider than that.
