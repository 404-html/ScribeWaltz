1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,580
You often mentioned disciplining 
children,

2
00:00:02,581 --> 00:00:07,581
so they behave.
What is your advice for making them 

3
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:08,250
behave without resorting to corporal 
punishment?

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,540
Well,
first of all,

5
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,550
it depends on what you mean by corporal 
punishment.

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:17,010
Um,
time out could be regarded as corporal 

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,461
punishment.
It also depends very much on the age of 

8
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:19,461
the child,
um,

9
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:22,530
at say a two year old,
well in my new book,

10
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:27,531
by the way,
I have a chapter in there called don't 

11
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:29,700
let your children do anything that makes
you dislike them.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,480
And the reason that I wrote a chapter 
about that is because people who let 

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,310
their children do things that make them 
dislike them,

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,580
end up disliking them.
And because there's a huge power 

15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,951
differential,
generally speaking between adults and 

16
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:48,261
children,
if you end up disliking your children 

17
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:49,050
because they're not behaving well,
they're behaving disgracefully say,

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,440
or they're,
or they're challenging your position in 

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,600
the authority hierarchy to regularly,
uh,

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,060
something you won't put up with.

21
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,620
By the way,
even if you think you will,

22
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,010
it's necessary to get your disciplinary 
routine straight.

23
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:06,360
So the first thing I would say is figure
out what the rules are.

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,930
There shouldn't be too many for two year
olds.

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,990
Basically.
They have to know what no means.

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,400
And they also have to learn as they 
approach three,

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,790
not to kick,
hit bite or steel.

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,060
Essentially.
Now it's easy to train a two year old.

29
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:29,061
What no means you can actually start 
with a child that's only 13 months old 

30
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:31,530
child that can cry,
let's say that or that can crawl.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Let's say that you have a child at 
starting to crawl and wants to explore 

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,400
the house.
So the first thing you do,

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,020
if you have any senses,
try to get rid of most things that the 

34
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,470
child could cause a tremendous amount of
trouble with,

35
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,550
uh,
to,

36
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,420
to the things or to the child so that 
it's reasonably safe.

37
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,860
Um,
and then the child is gonna wanna want 

38
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,270
crawl around and get into everything.
And so,

39
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,570
but maybe there are things you don't 
want him or her to get into.

40
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:00,660
Like maybe there's a.
Oh,

41
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,740
what would we say?
Maybe there's a tablecloth.

42
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,490
And on top of the table cloth,
there's a plant,

43
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:10,491
or maybe there's some plants on the 
floor and when the child is crawling and

44
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:13,020
goes off to do something that he or she 
shouldn't,

45
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,890
you can just grab his leg and you know 
gently but firmly and say no,

46
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,310
and the child will keep trying to move 
forward because they're stubborn little 

47
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,790
blinders and you can continue to say no.
And if you persist with saying no,

48
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,780
then the child will eventually give up 
and sort of go limp.

49
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,410
Now.
Now and often the child will cry when 

50
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,591
you do that,
and of course that might make you feel 

51
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:42,591
guilty.

52
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:45,440
But what that means is that you've 
effectively brought to behavior to a 

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,130
halt.
And if you do that 10 times,

54
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,360
you've got to watch your child and don't
stop them from exploring things that 

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,901
they need to explore.
And you want to use this sort of thing 

56
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:58,800
with judiciously.
You can grab them by the leg and say,

57
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,130
no,
no,

58
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,070
no.
And wait until they give up.

59
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,200
Usually they'll cry and then you can let
them go.

60
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,000
And then soon after,
you do that,

61
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:12,001
about 10 times soon.
Then if you just say no with the same 

62
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:13,300
tone of voice,
the child will generally what happens,

63
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,880
the child will immediately cry and then 
stop.

64
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:19,540
And then after about 10 repeats of no 
without having the late grabbed,

65
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,810
then no,
we'll just produce stopping of the 

66
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,841
behavior.
And that's unbelievably useful because 

67
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,690
as soon as you're.
You train your child to understand what 

68
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,291
no means,
then they really have free reign of the 

69
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,000
house in some sense with relatively 
minimal supervision from you.

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,120
First of all,
they can learn what things they're not 

71
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,891
supposed to get into.
And it's amazing how fast children can 

72
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,291
learn that and how fast they can 
generalize to the class of things that 

73
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:50,311
they shouldn't get into.
Like you don't have to teach them every 

74
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:50,311
single thing.
They can generalize very rapidly.

75
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:54,871
That's not much different than thinking,
but also once they are capable of 

76
00:03:55,001 --> 00:04:00,001
understanding what no means,
you have an extremely potent means of 

77
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:02,440
helping them regulate their behavior 
with a minimum of intervention.

78
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,390
So that's unbelievably useful.
So now let's say you have a two year old

79
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:10,330
who's pretty contentious and two year 
olds are pretty contentious.

80
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,420
Some of them in particular because both 
five percent of two year olds,

81
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:18,421
most of them are male,
are quite aggressive by temperament and 

82
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:20,080
those are the ones that if you put with 
other two year olds will frequently kick

83
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,060
hit,
bite or steel.

84
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,330
Not all kids are like that,
but some are and most of them get 

85
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:27,430
socialized out of that by the time 
they're about four.

86
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,610
Now let's say you have an at two,
they also start to experiment with 

87
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:32,610
saying,
no,

88
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,630
I'm back.
And also with misbehaving,

89
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,400
although they can do that even younger 
than that.

90
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,850
So if you have a two year old who's 
particularly rambunctious and who 

91
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,061
decides he isn't going to listen to you,
we use he in this example because it's 

92
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:47,000
boys that are more likely to misbehave 
and not,

93
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,830
uh,
not listen.

94
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,310
You can,
you can pick them up and you know by the

95
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:56,311
arms,
now you got to get your attitude right 

96
00:04:56,311 --> 00:04:58,950
because you don't want to be stupid.
You don't want to let your kid make you 

97
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,861
mad.
Especially when they're really little 

98
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:03,390
because you're really big and you can 
hurt them and so you gotta you gotTa 

99
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:03,390
have a clue.

100
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,440
That's why you want to get the rules of 
discipline in order,

101
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,470
the minimum rules of discipline and why 
you want to have a strategy,

102
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:13,471
but let's say you're a two or two year 
old is insisting upon doing something 

103
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:17,551
that you don't want him to do.
Like a inserting a fork into an 

104
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:20,440
electrical outlet and you just can't 
have that and so you can say no.

105
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,340
Hopefully you've already done the no 
training that I recommended and if that 

106
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,391
doesn't work,
what I recommend doing is picking the 

107
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:30,550
child up by the arms and then putting 
them on the steps.

108
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,360
Say,
look,

109
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:34,420
you sit there until you're ready to 
listen.

110
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Now I'm usually the child will sit there
and then the rule has to be something 

111
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:45,001
like you can get up as soon as you're 
ready to be a civilized human being 

112
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:48,391
again and you can refer to yourself,
your own attitude during a process like 

113
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:48,550
that.

114
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,550
Because if the child does comply and 
sits on the steps and then comes and 

115
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:53,550
says,
I'm ready to be good,

116
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,900
and you like them again,
you got to be honest about this.

117
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,080
Then you can tell that he's honest in 
his decision to rejoin the civilized 

118
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,040
world.
Now sometimes if you put a two year old 

119
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,170
that's particularly rambunctious on the 
staircase,

120
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,880
that as soon as you let go of their 
arms,

121
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:11,810
they'll run off and that can be a game 
or it can just be an act of defiance and

122
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:16,811
in that case then you go get them and he
put them back on the steps and you do 

123
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,070
that several times if necessarily if 
that.

124
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,080
That becomes a game.
Then you sit on the step and you hold 

125
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080
him by the arms.
Remember,

126
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,920
no anger because he's just too,
for God sake.

127
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:27,980
You know you don't have to be angry,
is put them on the steps and hold them.

128
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,610
Say,
look,

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,020
I'm not letting you go until you sit 
there and behave,

130
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,080
and so if you hold him for a while,
he'll squirm and look away and so forth,

131
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,570
but you can get his attention.
If you're a little bit stubborn,

132
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,930
you hold them there and say you're going
to sit there until I decide that you can

133
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,080
leave and so you hold them and he'll 
squirm and.

134
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,000
But you can outwait them if you're a 
patient,

135
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:52,001
but you got to make the time and then 
eventually he'll stop squirming and you 

136
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:55,151
can let them go and then you can sit 
there and watch him and when you think 

137
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:55,151
he's,
you know,

138
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:57,860
decided that he's going to be a 
civilized creature.

139
00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:02,861
Then you can say that's good and you can
give them a pat on the head and you can 

140
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:02,861
say,
let's go back and do what we're doing,

141
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,190
and the rule has to be.

142
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:09,190
You see that the punishment not only has
to bring the behavior to a halt in the 

143
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,470
most merciful manner possible,
but it's still effective,

144
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,710
but it also has to satisfy your need for
order and justice so that you don't 

145
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,451
carry resentment and irritation about 
the child's misbehavior forward with you

146
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:26,300
because you don't want a kid yourself 
about what sort of Nice person you are.

147
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,420
You're not nearly as nice a person as 
you think and no one likes to be brought

148
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:35,240
down the authority hierarchy by a 
recalcitrant two-year-old.

149
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,720
So in almost all circumstances,
those processes will suffice.

150
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,440
There's other disciplinary strategies 
that you can use to that are more 

151
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,440
positive.
I mean,

152
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,740
one of the things that you can do,
for example,

153
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:53,741
if you're.
Let's say you want to get your child to 

154
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:54,380
go to bed,
which is a really good idea.

155
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:59,381
You should set a stable bedtime for your
child and I would say if they're under 

156
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:02,861
four,
it should be around eight or seven or 

157
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:06,311
something like that because you want to 
have a life and you want to have a life 

158
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:07,700
with your wife so that you don't end up 
hating your child.

159
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,150
And so one of the things you can do if 
you want to train your child to go to 

160
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,571
bed at eight,
so maybe he's not going to bed until 10 

161
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:17,420
right now and you want to fix that.
So you say,

162
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:22,421
okay,
go to the grocery store or a little 

163
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:23,480
convenience store and buy 10 little 
gifts and it can be cheap.

164
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:25,310
Kids don't care.
They're not very bright,

165
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:26,330
you know,
you can fool them,

166
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,610
so by 10 things that you think your kid 
would like and wrap them up and then put

167
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,270
them up on a shelf where he can see them
at,

168
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,360
can't get at them.
Then you say,

169
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,500
look,
kid,

170
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,480
I'm going to put you to bed at 9:30
tonight,

171
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:43,930
and uh,
if you don't get out of bed then I'm 

172
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,890
going to give you one of these.
I'm going to give you one of these gifts

173
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:46,370
in the morning.

174
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,620
So,
or if the.

175
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,710
Or you can do it another way too.
If the child is always giving you a 

176
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:53,710
rough time about getting ready for bed 
and going to bed,

177
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,080
you can say,
look,

178
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:59,081
if you're,
if you put on your pajamas without 

179
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,761
fussing and you climb into bed,
then they'll give you one of these 

180
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:02,520
little gifts.
And so then if that works,

181
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:05,310
then the child can have a little gift 
and he's in bed at 9:30

182
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,040
and then you can make it nine and then 
you can make it 8:30.

183
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,320
And then you can make it eight.
And those are called.

184
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,330
That's called success of approximation,
right?

185
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:14,850
You hit the target,
you specify the target that you want the

186
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:19,260
child to achieve,
and then use small rewards not too often

187
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:24,470
in order to attain that goal.
And those are unbelievably effective 

188
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,320
strategies and they can actually be 
pretty fun.

189
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,590
But I would say the advice to not let 
your child do anything that makes you 

190
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,000
dislike them is really,
really useful.

191
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,420
Um,
you want to talk this over with your 

192
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,431
partner too so that you have your 
disciplinary strategies and your rules 

193
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:42,630
talked out so that you don't work at 
cross purposes to one another.

194
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,490
So.
Okay,

195
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,230
so that's probably good enough for that.
