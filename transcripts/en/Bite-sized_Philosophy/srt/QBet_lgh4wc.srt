1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,990
What would be a practical approach for 
developing your shadow?

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:04,550
Well,
that's a good one.

3
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:09,551
Let's,
let's do a little review of union 

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:09,551
psychology.
The first thing is,

5
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,880
if you want to know about this,
the proper sources.

6
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:13,310
Carl [inaudible] collected works volume 
nine,

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,510
volume nine,
and there's two parts to volume 9:00

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,510
AM be published as separate texts and 
volume nine is called archetypes of the 

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,391
collective unconscious and the other one
is called a ion.

10
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:31,730
But in archetypes of the collective 
unconscious,

11
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:36,731
there's a good discussion of the persona
and the shadow and the persona you could

12
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:40,490
say.
Is that a good way of thinking about it?

13
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:45,491
You know,
you watch all those Rom coms where 

14
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:48,311
there's always kind of a Beta male guy 
who's being real friendly and always 

15
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:52,481
failing miserably with women because 
basically he's lying to himself and to 

16
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:52,481
them,
um,

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,700
he's a persona and a persona is the face
that you show to the world when you're 

18
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:03,911
trying to pretend and to convince 
yourself and others that you're,

19
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,370
I would say harmless,
but we could say a good person,

20
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,570
but a good person isn't harmless.
A good person is capable of,

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,180
well,
maybe a good person is capable of 

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,940
anything but is willing to hold that in 
abeyance.

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,300
I read this interesting commentary a 
little while ago on a statement by 

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,651
Christ in the New Testament and the 
statement generally interpreted is that 

25
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:34,971
the meek shall inherit the earth,
but I was looking up the multiple 

26
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:38,271
translations of the word meek.
Meek is actually derived from a Greek 

27
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:40,860
word of course,
because the Bible,

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,830
at least some of the original forms of 
the Bible were in Greek.

29
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,540
And that word didn't exactly mean meek.
It meant something like,

30
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,750
uh,

31
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,230
those who have weapons and the ability 
to use them,

32
00:01:57,231 --> 00:02:02,231
but cert,
but determined to keep the machine will 

33
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:05,561
inherit the world.
And that means that people who are 

34
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:07,910
capable of force,
let's say,

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,380
but decide not to use it,
are in the proper moral position.

36
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:14,690
And meet you commented on that a fair 
bit too.

37
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:15,260
You know,
he,

38
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,570
he,
um,

39
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,010
thought of most moral morality as 
cowardice,

40
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:21,110
not because morality itself was 
cowardice,

41
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:26,111
but because most people who are cowards 
disguise their coward,

42
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,600
cowardice as morality,
and they claim that they're 

43
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,560
harmlessness,
which is actually a consequence of their

44
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:36,290
fear and inability to be harmful,
say,

45
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:41,291
or to be dangerous,
is actually a sign of their moral 

46
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,950
integrity.
And that's a really bad idea.

47
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,720
So,
you know,

48
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,180
if you're an ax murderer but you don't 
have an ax,

49
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:51,110
that doesn't mean that your moral.
So now with regards to,

50
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,730
so that's the persona and the persona is
the mask that you wear.

51
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,730
And that's what persona means is the 
mask that you wear to convince and the 

52
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,860
world that you're not a terrible monster
so that when you look at yourself in the

53
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:04,540
mirror,
you don't have to run away screaming.

54
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,070
You know,
when you might think,

55
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:11,071
well that's a bit of an overstatement.
But you'll was very interested in 

56
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:15,070
phenomena such as say,
psychological.

57
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,090
The psychological phenomena that would 
characterize the actions of someone who 

58
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,060
might be an Auschwitz camp guard for 
example.

59
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,450
And uh,
you know,

60
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,440
that's pretty monstrous form of 
behavior.

61
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:31,441
And the thing about Auschwitz camp 
guards is that there's no reason to 

62
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:35,461
assume really,
that they were much different than 

63
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:35,461
normal people.
Now,

64
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:36,940
there would have been exceptions 
obviously,

65
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,240
but and what that means is that perhaps 
youtube could be an Auschwitz camp guard

66
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:47,371
and perhaps you would even derive some 
enjoyment out of it and you might think 

67
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:47,860
no,
but you shouldn't think not so quickly.

68
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,250
And what that also implies is that if 
you could see what that meant when you 

69
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,010
looked in the mirror and looked at 
yourself,

70
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:59,011
you might run away screaming because 
you'd have a revelation of just exactly 

71
00:03:59,011 --> 00:04:01,630
what the human being is capable of.
And that's a very unpleasant revelation.

72
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:06,631
And also one of the things that stops 
people from being enlightened because 

73
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:10,770
that revelation of the evil of the self 
is part of the journey to enlightenment 

74
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,420
and an early part.
Now the shadow would be all the parts of

75
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,790
the personality that the persona 
rejects.

76
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,260
And that might be the aggressive 
element.

77
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:23,270
Certainly the case.
That's the case with for people who are 

78
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,240
hyper agreeable,
and now you can tell,

79
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,330
I think one of the best.
There's two pathways to the development 

80
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:30,730
of the shadow and they're tightly 
aligned with one another.

81
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,820
Um,
the fundamental pathway is truth,

82
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,640
and that's to face the bitter truth 
about yourself,

83
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:38,800
but to break that down more 
particularly,

84
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:43,150
you might think about that as the 
capacity to observe your own resentment.

85
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,230
You're going to be resentful and bitter 
in many situations because you don't get

86
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,660
what you want and if you watch that 
resentment,

87
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:50,620
bitterness,
clc,

88
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:55,621
that it produces fantasies that can be 
unbelievably dark and that can be very 

89
00:04:55,621 --> 00:05:00,331
frightening and you might not want to 
admit to yourself that you're actually 

90
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:03,691
capable of having fantasies like that or
impulses like that or aggressive 

91
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:08,550
feelings like that.
But the thing is is that if those 

92
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,420
aggressive feelings and impulses and 
fantasies are integrated into your 

93
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,961
character,
it's like you're opening up a dialogue 

94
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:17,971
with a part of yourself that can be very
forceful and strong and dangerous and 

95
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:21,520
it's really useful to be dangerous 
because if you can,

96
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,700
if you can be dangerous,
you often don't have to be.

97
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,290
And it's often weak.
People,

98
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,420
for example,
it's weak men generally speaking,

99
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,790
who rape.
You know that that's a very,

100
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,010
very common occurrence and that's a 
violent act,

101
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:35,350
but it's born out of weakness,
not out of strength,

102
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,190
that's for sure.

103
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,240
And so anyways,
you attend to your resentment honestly,

104
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:42,760
and you observe yourself and what you're
actually like.

105
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,940
You got to pay attention as if you don't
know yourself as if you might harbor 

106
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,640
hidden devils and then maybe they'll 
emerge.

107
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:53,641
Now,
young also felt that sort of embedded 

108
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:54,880
inside the shot where the contra sexual 
tendencies and so for example,

109
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,670
sometimes you see people who are well 
men let's say,

110
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,790
and we can.
We can also talk about women in this 

111
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,041
regard.
Men who have integrated their shadow 

112
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,420
often also develop a kind of peculiar 
grace that would be a consequence of not

113
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:11,840
only allowing their aggressive side to 
step forward,

114
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:15,620
but also their feminine in Compassionate
side that might,

115
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,710
that they may have kept squelched 
because of embarrassment about it or 

116
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,410
because they'd been harassed for being 
weak or any number of things.

117
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,710
So,
but the practical approach for 

118
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,451
developing your shadow,
I would say is to contemplate and 

119
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:31,640
consider your resentment and notice what
it says [inaudible] your resentment will

120
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,590
also tell you what you have to say.

121
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,690
You know,
so look,

122
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,280
look at what happened at Google this 
weekend.

123
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:39,680
You know,
James Damore wrote that memo and you can

124
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:44,681
imagine he was pretty angry and perhaps 
even somewhat resentful at having to 

125
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:49,031
attend that diversity seminar.
And I'm really just using this as an 

126
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:51,791
example,
but what he did was decide that that 

127
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,290
meant that he had something that he had 
to say and then look at the consequences

128
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:54,890
of that.
Man.

129
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,620
It's an absolutely unbelievable.
And so you know,

130
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:00,800
if you're feeding oppressed at work or 
you're oppressed in your life or,

131
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:02,870
or you know where you're oppressing 
yourself,

132
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,510
then you got to notice that you're 
feeling oppressed.

133
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:07,550
Then you have to notice that you're 
feeling resentful,

134
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,320
resentful and angry and bitter,
and maybe even like Cain in the story of

135
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:15,320
Cain and Abel because cane is sort of 
the architectural bitter man.

136
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,650
And then you have to decide what it is 
that you need to do in order to remove 

137
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:20,650
from yourself that bitterness.

138
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,510
And that's usually means that there's 
something that you have to say and then 

139
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,030
you have to say it because you're soul 
depends on it.

140
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,010
And not only does your soul depending on
it,

141
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:31,550
I would say the fate of the world 
depends on it because you know you might

142
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,070
be wrong and then you should be 
straightened out.

143
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:36,770
Maybe you're just being whiny and you 
have to talk to somebody about that.

144
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:39,860
But it may be that you're actually 
detecting something wrong.

145
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:42,590
Some tyranny that's directed towards you
and other people.

146
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,470
And it's like your moral obligation to 
speak up about it.

147
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,770
And so many workplaces become toxic to 
use a terrible cliche because of the 

148
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,300
people in the won't speak up for what 
they actually want,

149
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:56,900

they're all twisted up about it and,

150
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,290

00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:09,260
your shadow fundamentally is radical.
Honesty and young said that in a genuine

153
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:11,780
moral effort was a good substitute for 
psychotherapy.
