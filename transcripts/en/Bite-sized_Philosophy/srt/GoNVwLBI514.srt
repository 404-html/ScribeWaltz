1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,240
And so they're off to pleasure island 
dark place and uh,

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,820
the coachman opens the gates and lets 
the delinquents into pleasure island and

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,260
they basically have a riot.
And this is pleasure island here.

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,160
It's full of amusement park rides.
And you know,

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,660
one of the things that's kind of 
interesting about horror movies,

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,990
I'm sure you've noticed this,
is that they're often sat at amusement 

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,170
parks and clowns are often characters of
horror.

8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,110
We'll leave the clowns aside for now.
But the amusement park thing that's 

9
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,221
pretty interesting.
It's like why in the world with an 

10
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:43,221
amusement park,
he,

11
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:45,420
a place of horror.
And the first question might be,

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,400
well,
have you ever been to an amusement park?

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,370
Because there is something about them 
that's really.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,370
They have a dark side,
clear,

15
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:58,371
dark side.
And part of it is that people with 

16
00:00:58,371 --> 00:00:59,520
nothing better to do or spending money 
stupidly.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,890
And they're being fleeced by the people 
who operate the the amusement park,

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,240
you know,
and they have,

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,260
let's say,
a stereotypically dark reputation and 

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,360
they're moving around all the time,
which is also something that psychopaths

21
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:20,361
do and all they're doing is moving from 
community to community and taking the 

22
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:23,820
money from the rubes fundamentally.
And so the amusement park,

23
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,770
well if you walk through an amusement 
park without sort of thing in mind,

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,270
maybe that's also coloring your vision 
of course,

25
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:35,700
but it's something that you could see 
very immediately.

26
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,310
So there's something about them that's 
sort of deeply sad,

27
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:43,311
but there's also that under,
there's an underlying horror that 

28
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,711
characterizes them that it's easy for 
horror movie or horror novel writers to 

29
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,510
immediately expand upon.
And there's something about it that,

30
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,150
that makes sense to people.
So it's too easy.

31
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:59,151
Maybe that's.
And it's also all short term 

32
00:01:59,151 --> 00:01:59,151
gratification.
That's the other thing.

33
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:00,660
So you spend your money very rapidly and
it's gone.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:00,960
Yep.

35
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:07,950
Yes,
exactly.

36
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:12,951
Well,
that's the impulsive element that the 

37
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:12,951
comment was,
it's a celebration of,

38
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:13,830
of meanings divorced from reality.
Yeah.

39
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:14,250
That's.
Well,

40
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,990
it's also outside of reality,
right?

41
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:20,991
That's why it's on an island,
it's a separate universe and it's a 

42
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:25,251
universe where nothing that's happening 
is connected to anything outside and 

43
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:26,010
you're spending your hard earned money,
let's say,

44
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,060
but it isn't that much.
It's certainly not an investment.

45
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,750
It's not that much different than 
burning it what is because of course you

46
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:35,160
get some pleasure out of it,
but.

47
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,940
But it isn't going with their everyday 
is probably not the wisest move that you

48
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:46,311
could make.
So the animators do a good job of,

49
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,890
of while I'm presenting the,
what would you call it,

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,360
the in hedonism,
I guess I would say of a place like 

51
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,151
that.
This is a place where you're going to 

52
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:02,151
have fun.
That's what it's for.
