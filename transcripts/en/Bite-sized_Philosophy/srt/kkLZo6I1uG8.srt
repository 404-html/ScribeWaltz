1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,800
They don't have to believe it.
That's pure narcissism at work,

2
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:13,681
by the way,
you don't want to hijack hijacking event

3
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:32,071
like this and other people put time and 
effort into and to use the civility of 

4
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:38,881
the crowd and the civility of the 
organizers as an excuse to blatantly 

5
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:43,801
yellow.
You're ill informed opinions is no way 

6
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:44,260
to conduct a civil dialogue.
It's absolutely appalling.

7
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,850
The people who do that should be 
embarrassed.

8
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,670
Thank you.
Thank you.

9
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,480
Yes.
I would also say that as students and as

10
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:02,760
faculty members,
you shouldn't put up with it.

11
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,210
There is no way that you should allow 
people who are doing this to hijack your

12
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:11,211
educational opportunities and to bend 
and twist the functions and the 

13
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:13,890
structures of the university.
It's not a good thing.

14
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,950
Not In any way at all.
I would say that was a very disgraceful 

15
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,760
display fundamentally,
so let's stick with it.

16
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,270
Why?
Why do you think people are afraid of 

17
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,730
free speech?
Well,

18
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,790
you know,
people develop an ideological view of 

19
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,641
the world because they don't want to 
think through things in real detail and 

20
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:41,060
they're aided and embedded in that 
endeavor by their pathological 

21
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,220
professors who are feeding them.
What would I say?

22
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,590
Oversimplified an oversimplified radical
view of the world,

23
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,150
in my estimation,
is fundamentally based in,

24
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,510
in resentment.
Not that there's no reason for say,

25
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:57,030
a left wing view of the world and we can
get to that later.

26
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,190
It's easy virtue.
You know,

27
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,220
you can stand up in front of 900 people 
with your art and your and your 

28
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,691
screeching and you can.
You can declaim to the entire audience 

29
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:13,381
your fundamental moral superiority.
You can tell everyone at once that 

30
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:17,551
they're all beneath you and you're 
standing for the right thing and 

31
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:17,890
absolutely none of that is earned.
You know,

32
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:18,460
like,
what the hell?

33
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,040
What the hell was that?
There's,

34
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,570
it's come seriously man.
There's just,

35
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:27,571
it's just complete misbehavior.
It's embarrassing and the fact that the 

36
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:31,501
people who do that don't have enough 
sense to go hide their head in shame 

37
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,430
just tells you how badly socialize they 
are and how terribly educated they are.

38
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,790
And the thing is,
the thing that's so awful is that there 

39
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:38,790
are professors and educators who promote
that and say,

40
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,060
well,
that's how you change the world.

41
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:41,470
It's like it is how you change the 
world,

42
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,360
but it's certainly not how you make it 
better.

43
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,550
You make it worse.
Clearly,

44
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,970
you know,
there is no comfort in that and there's 

45
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:50,970
nothing about it.
Impressive.

46
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,680
It's no,
it's no better in some sense than a two 

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,080
year old having a tantrum on the floor.
It shows,

48
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,350
as far as I'm concerned,
it approximately the same level of 

49
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,261
psychosocial development.
So when the fact that this is happening 

50
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:04,690
continually,
universities is,

51
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:10,150
it's,
it truly makes me embarrassed to be 

52
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,781
associated with the university.
And now I say that with great 

53
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:13,240
displeasure because,
you know,

54
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:18,241
I've been working for great universities
for a very long time and the university 

55
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,240
is an absolutely remarkable institution.
You know,

56
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:23,320
it's survived for a thousand years and,
and to see it,

57
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,380
to see it brought down by by people 
whose behavior would be out of place at 

58
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,620
a four year old's birthday party is is 
something something bizible to behold.
