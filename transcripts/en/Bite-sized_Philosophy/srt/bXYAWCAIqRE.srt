1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,890
Yes,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:06,910
you if you can elaborate a bit on,
you mentioned you talked about this 

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,700
mental process where people do the thing
that's hard but less,

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,370
less hard,
but still basically shadow.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,630
That's actually a really productive way 
of procrastinating,

6
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:21,870
although it comes with its own problems 
of rationalization,

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,320
so reinforces certain circuit.
I'll put it in a way that says that 

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,730
those can go away,
so you need to bring up the.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,640
The other inhibitory circuits.
Just wondering if you could elaborate.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,670
Well,
I can sure is in the realm of 

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:38,670
possibility around their understanding 
that.

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,140
Well,
I've derived out partly from my study of

13
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:44,090
addiction and also from my study of

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,860
recovery from posttraumatic stress 
disorder,

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,920
but let's talk about addiction.
So there's a series of actions that 

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,660
occur before you take your cocaine.
Some of those are local.

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,150
They are the things that happened 
immediately before and some of those are

18
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:07,151
distal.
They're farther back in the chain of 

19
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,160
events and when you.
When you have a hit of cocaine,

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,450
it produces a dopaminergic burst and 
that feels really good,

21
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:15,860
but it also makes the circuits that were
immediately active before that grow.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,330
That's what reinforcement is,
and then the growth is proportionate,

23
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,870
not linearly,
but it's proportionate to how long 

24
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,470
before that event occurred.
The closer it is,

25
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:32,471
the stronger they're going to get,
but even the ones that are somewhat 

26
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:33,230
distal get some reinforcement because 
you might say,

27
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:35,690
well,
what did you do before you,

28
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,630
you found your latest fix?
And the answer is,

29
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,590
well,
how long before?

30
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,210
Well,
the closer,

31
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:44,540
the more reward.
And so what happens then is that,

32
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,480
so if you take that person out of the 
normal environment,

33
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:50,760
you put them into a treatment center,
they're off.

34
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,770
They're a physical addiction,
which is a weird thing in the case of 

35
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,950
cocaine,
but I'm like not that long a week.

36
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,090
I'll do it two weeks for sure.
Even heroin and alcohol for sure,

37
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:04,760
if you can get them through the seizure 
part without dying.

38
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,190
Um,
and so they're done.

39
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,160
They're physiologically dependent 
anymore.

40
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,220
But you let that person go.
And the first thing that happens is his 

41
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,530
old friend who he's always out doing 
drugs with shows up and bang,

42
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:23,531
he's craving like mad.
And that's because that thing is in an 

43
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:27,131
area is not dead at all and it's 
activated by the queue and it's,

44
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,690
it's a circuit.
It's not.

45
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,140
It's a personality.
It only wants one thing at once.

46
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,140
Cocaine,
it's going to suppress any non related 

47
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,410
thoughts and it'll use lies.
That's no problem.

48
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:42,860
Especially if lies have been reinforced,
which they certainly have.

49
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,090
Where are you off to sun,
you know you'll have a live for that and

50
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:50,990
then 10 minutes later you have your drug
and so that little lie has just grown.

51
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,260
Or maybe you think you've tried to quit.
You think to hell with it.

52
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:57,860
And every time,
10 minutes before you take your drug,

53
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:00,700
you think to hell with it.
And you do that a thousand times.

54
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,040
Well believe me that to hell with it,
circuit,

55
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,400
that sucker is strong.
And so it's alive and it's not like it 

56
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,170
just disappears.
It can't,

57
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,490
it's you,
it's grown in there.

58
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,700
Now you can build another circuit to 
shut it down and you can help decompose 

59
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,440
across time by not giving it what it 
wants,

60
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,920
but you're going to have to not give it 
what it wants in all of the multiple 

61
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,830
contexts that you've already associated 
with the drug.

62
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,130
Some of you probably smoked and then 
tried to quit smoking and what you'll 

63
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,800
see is you get a craving when,
well,

64
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:35,050
when you have a cup of coffee or when 
you're finished dinner,

65
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:40,051
when you're done having a phone call or 
when you first get up in the morning or 

66
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:43,200
whenever you've regularly had the drug,
whatever you had the drug in 

67
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,641
relationship to even complex things like
ending a conversation will produce a 

68
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:51,951
cute craving and so then that can 
extinguish overtime if you punish it by 

69
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:55,290
either punishing it or not letting it 
get what it's wants,

70
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,530
but a lot you have to build another 
circuit to just shut it down and then 

71
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,530
that circuits kind of fragile and stress
can often disrupt it.

72
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,430
So

73
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,470
that can be read about quitting smoking 
or things like,

74
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,960
oh sure.
Well,

75
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:10,560
part of it.
Well,

76
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:15,561
I begins a whole different thing because
it seems to have a direct physiological 

77
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:15,660
effect,
but you know,

78
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,220
the,
the,

79
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,280
the addiction has a cognitive component.
It's full of thoughts and desires and 

80
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,310
wants and you know,
you may have to build,

81
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,580
you have,
may have to rebuild your whole 

82
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:28,740
personality in order to,
to get that thing cornered.

83
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,280
Religious conversion for example,
is in a really effective treatment for 

84
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,671
alcoholism.
That's partly why alcoholic alcoholics 

85
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:38,700
anonymous works for the people for whom 
it does work,

86
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,330
but religious conversion,
which is total personality conversion is

87
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:47,331
actually one of the few things that we 
know of that's an effective treatment 

88
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:48,030
for alcoholism.
We don't know how to induce it,

89
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:53,570
but although that's not exactly true 
either because I'm in the early work 

90
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:57,520
with Lsd was lsd was quite promising as 
a treatment for,

91
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,680
for an alcohol addiction and there's 
recent work with silicide button's 

92
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,000
showing that if you,
if people have a mystical experience 

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,701
when you give them Psilocybin,
their success rate and quitting smoking 

94
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:13,851
is about 80 percent,
which is way higher than any 

95
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:14,130
pharmacological intervention for smoking
has ever beat.

96
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,110
So.
Alright.

97
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,440
We should probably call it a day,
so we'll see you in a week.
