1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:02,980
Hi,
Dr Peterson,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,670
I've been wanting to ask you this,
uh,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,830
for a while now since I started watching
your lectures.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,910
Um,
after I started reading a Nietzsche's 

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,710
beyond good and evil,
I came upon a paragraph in his chapter 

6
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:21,441
on scholars that really,
really bothered me and it's actually 

7
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:21,441
bothers me to this day.
Uh,

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,310
he,
he talked about this kind of person,

9
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:26,820
like they were just a mirror,
like they stretched,

10
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:31,821
he said every part of their skin 
basically to allow every new piece of 

11
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:35,871
information that they took on and then 
all they ever were was just an 

12
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:40,191
instrument.
They were just a mirror reflecting what 

13
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:41,340
they had learned,
never actually having generated anything

14
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,130
on their own.
And it's bothered me because I feel like

15
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:46,330
in a way sort of like,
it's,

16
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:51,331
it's,
it's impacted my identity a lot because 

17
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,811
I don't know,
how are you supposed to create 

18
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:53,811
something,
you know,

19
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:53,811
so.

20
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:54,440
Okay,
well that's okay that,

21
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:56,010
that's a really good question.
I mean,

22
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,490
nature is often clashed with the 
existentialists right?

23
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:04,491
And so one of the tenants of existential
is there's two real tenants of 

24
00:01:04,491 --> 00:01:05,760
existentialism.
There's more,

25
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:10,380
but obviously we're over simplifying,
but one is that life is a problem.

26
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,170
It isn't because there's something wrong
with you.

27
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,990
It's that life is a problem,
and so that's often contrasted with the 

28
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,790
Friday and view,
which is that if you have a problem,

29
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,820
it's because something went wrong during
your development.

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,350
The existentialist said,
no,

31
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,440
no.
It's like life is a problem.

32
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:33,441
Make no mistake about it,
and that the purpose of

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,480
the purpose of scholarship is in some 
sense to solve that problem and so for 

34
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,380
Nisha,
like he said,

35
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:54,381
all truths are bloody truth to me,
and what he meant by that was that if an

36
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:59,511
idea didn't incarnate itself in you and 
transform your perceptions and your 

37
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:04,641
actions,
then you were merely possessed by the 

38
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:07,341
idea you.
You're merely a spokesperson for the 

39
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:07,341
idea.
Or You could say that the idea possessed

40
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:09,120
you.
You're a puppet for the idea.

41
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,860
It's not you.
It's the idea is in you and it has you.

42
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,430
You haven't taken the idea and 
incorporated with you and made it part 

43
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,821
of your life,
and so there's a romanticism that's 

44
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:22,821
associated with that,
right?

45
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:27,351
That's the passionate scholar.
The person for whom ideas are not 

46
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:27,351
merely,

47
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,510
they're not merely,
what would you call abstracted 

48
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,020
representations that can be tossed about
as if they're commodities.

49
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,020
They're,
they're,

50
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,410
they're more like,
they're more like personalities.

51
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:46,411
That might be another way of thinking 
about it and so if you're,

52
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,760
if,
if those ideas are compelling,

53
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:53,761
then you don't like.
One thing I learned along time ago and I

54
00:02:54,251 --> 00:02:58,180
think this is probably relevant.
I know when I was a kid I liked to argue

55
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,420
and I like to win arguments or,
or,

56
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,510
or lose them,
although I like winning them a lot 

57
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,581
better,
but I didn't really mind so much what 

58
00:03:08,581 --> 00:03:09,160
the content of the argument was.
You know,

59
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:14,161
I,
I could engage in it like a sparring 

60
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,250
match and it was in some sense to 
establish dominance,

61
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:16,900
right?
To establish intellectual dominance.

62
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:22,110
I quit doing that when I was in my mid 
twenties because I thought that that was

63
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:25,240
too shallow and approach to the ideas.

64
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,680
They,
they're not commodities of that sort.

65
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,710
They're there.
They have tendrils that reached down 

66
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,590
into the living.
That's the right way to think about it.

67
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,310
And so nature's criticism of scholars 
and he did this a lot,

68
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,330
was that they were bloodless.
No,

69
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,460
they didn't.
They were full of performative 

70
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:47,460
contradictions.
That's another way of thinking about it.

71
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,141
They'd say one thing and do another 
because their intellect was completely 

72
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:53,020
dissociated from their,
from their actions.

73
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,790
And he,
he,

74
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,880
he thought that was a very bad idea.
And I think that that's a good 

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,750
criticism.
I think it is a bad idea.

76
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:04,960
I also think it makes for an 
extraordinarily boring lecturer,

77
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,240
you know,
because you can tell if you're listening

78
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:12,241
to someone,
whether the ideas that you're hearing 

79
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:13,600
are merely being passed through the 
person as if they're being memorized,

80
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:18,601
say,
or whether they're part of the dynamic 

81
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:20,710
core of the person and if they're part 
of the dynamic core of the person,

82
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:23,140
then they're almost always engaging in 
gripping.

83
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,680
And so he wasn't a fan of bloodless 
scholars.

84
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:29,560
And I think that's correct because one 
of the things that I see,

85
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,360
it's not a good idea to have ideas 
possess you unless you know what the 

86
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:41,611
idea is that we're up to and lots of 
people are possessed by ideas rather 

87
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:46,531
than possessing them and that what that 
means is they haven't taken the ideas 

88
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:47,230
and integrated them into their own 
being.

89
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,920
They haven't.
It's like an incarnation in a sense.

90
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:55,921
They have an incarnated the ideas in 
embodied form and so they're incomplete.

91
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,270
You know,
Nisha also in thus spake Zarathustra.

92
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:02,980
When Xero booster comes down the 
mountain,

93
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,790
he sees a bunch of people gathered 
around a famous individual,

94
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,770
I think maybe a scholar but doesn't 
really matter.

95
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,880
And when zero theaster goes and looks at
the personality,

96
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,680
season's a little tiny midget with a 
gigantic ear.

97
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,260
And so he's a hyper specialist,
right?

98
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,830
And so he has a pretty impressive ear,
but he's only this big.

99
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,100
And that was niches,
imagistic commentary on the danger of 

100
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,431
hyper specialization and also on the 
danger of adulation for hyper 

101
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:33,481
specialization.
And because he thought about it as a 

102
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:35,230
kind of deformity now,
nature was a pretty harsh guy,

103
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:40,231
but um,
but he did address the issue of the 

104
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:45,811
relationship between intellectual 
knowledge and action because for Nicha,

105
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,510
those things are not to be separated in 
some sense.

106
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,510
So yeah.
So maybe,

107
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,150
I don't know why,
maybe it bothered you,

108
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,010
like it's hard to say why it bothered 
you.

109
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:02,330
It might have bothered you because it 
sort of undermine the idea of scholar.

110
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,540
But the other possibility,
and this isn't an accusation because 

111
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:07,540
obviously I don't know anything about 
you,

112
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,400
but it might also be that it struck a 
chord,

113
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:14,401
you know,
and that maybe you were doubtful or 

114
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:17,561
questioning how tightly associated your 
intellectual endeavor was with your 

115
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:26,240
actual character and your practice.
So that's another possibility.

116
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:31,241
I mean,
that's a really good thing to think 

117
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:31,700
about because generally speaking,
that integration is very much lacking.

118
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,120
People are a lot smarter and fluid with 
their ideas that they are ethical and 

119
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,700
consistent and characterized by 
integrity.

120
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,690
So

121
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,100
thank you.
