1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,810
And the midianites sold Joseph into 
Egypt,

2
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:08,811
unto Potiphar,
an officer of Pharaohs and captain of 

3
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:08,811
the guard.
And Joseph was brought down to Egypt and

4
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:10,290
Potiphar,
an officer of Pharaoh,

5
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:13,260
captain of the guard,
and the Egyptian bought him of the hands

6
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:15,420
of the Ishmaelites,
which had brought him down thither.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,130
So now he's a slave.
So now you'd think,

8
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:24,210
well that would be,
this is a man who has a lot of reason to

9
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:27,180
be irritated at the structure of 
reality.

10
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:32,181
Right?
He's gone from being the favorite to 

11
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:32,370
being betrayed by all of his brothers.
That's pretty rough.

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,240
And then he's being transformed into a 
slave and now he's being.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,360
He's being sold to work as a slave.
So you'd think that that would corrupt 

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,080
his character because you know,
one of the things,

15
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:46,230
I think this is the case anyways,
I think people are always looking for an

16
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,390
excuse to have their character 
corrupted.

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,080
Because if your character is corrupted,
then you get to lie and you get to cheat

18
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:53,730
and you get to steal and you get to be 
trade.

19
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:56,160
You get to act resentfully and you get 
to do nothing.

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,340
And that's all easy.
It's easier to lie than to tell the 

21
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,101
truth.
It's easier to do nothing than to do 

22
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:04,101
something.
So there's always part of you thinking,

23
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:06,090
well,
I need a justification for being useless

24
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:09,060
and horrible because that,
that'd be a lot less work.

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,470
And so then if something terrible comes 
along,

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,530
you think a,
that's just exactly the excuse that I 

27
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,580
was waiting for.
And then out all that comes,

28
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,980
you know,
soldiers should Ipsen when he was in the

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,120
concentration camps in Russia watching 
how people behaved,

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,820
you know,
he said that there were people that were

31
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:34,821
put into camps who immediately became 
trustees are guards and they were even 

32
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:36,240
more vicious than the people who had 
been hired as guards.

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,960
And his idea was that they had collected
all that.

34
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,890
He called it fallenness,
if I remember correctly around them in 

35
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:50,901
normal life.
But they didn't have the opportunity to 

36
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:53,991
express it.
But as soon as you gave them the 

37
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:53,991
opportunity,
it was like there,

38
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:53,991
it was right away.
And so,

39
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,340
so one of the messages that seems to 
echo through these old testament stories

40
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:05,580
is that just because something terrible 
happens to you doesn't mean that you get

41
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:10,581
to be,
that you get to wander off the path and 

42
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:13,350
make things worse.
And maybe it doesn't matter how terrible

43
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:17,520
it is that what happens to you,
that's a tough call,

44
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:22,521
you know,
because you see people now and then in 

45
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:22,521
life who they've really got it rough 
man,

46
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:24,090
like 50 bad things are happening to them
at the same time.

47
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:24,930
And you think,
oh,

48
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:27,600
it's no wonder if you are bitter and 
resentful and hostile.

49
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,920
It'd be like,
yeah,

50
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,570
no wonder.
But then you meet people and social hits

51
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:33,570
and again talked about this in the Gulag
archipelago.

52
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:36,060
He said he met lots of people in a not 
lot.

53
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,980
He met enough people to impress him in 
the concentration camp system who didn't

54
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:45,150
allow their misfortunes to corrupt them.
And that's something man,

55
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,420
because maybe the only real misfortune 
is to become corrupted.

56
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,630
That's a really useful thing to think,
you know,

57
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:56,631
maybe the rest of it,
maybe the rest of it is trivial in 

58
00:02:56,631 --> 00:03:00,201
comparison.
I know that's a rough thing because you 

59
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:01,660
can be in very harsh circumstances,
but I do think there's something to that

60
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,560
and the Lord was with Joseph and he was 
a prosperous man and he was in the house

61
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,200
of his master.
The Egyptian and his master saw that the

62
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:11,380
Lord was with him and the Lord made all 
that he did to prosper in his hand.

63
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,590
So that's an echo of the idea that we 
encountered earlier about walking with 

64
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:16,590
God.
Right.

65
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,670
So Adam walked with God before he ate 
the fruit with eve and then he wouldn't 

66
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,220
walk with God and they had noah walked 
with God and Abraham walked with God.

67
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:25,650
And so the idea is,
well,

68
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:27,820
that's that alignment with the highest 
ideal.

69
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:30,040
I think it's something like that and you
know,

70
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,370
we can think about that as a 
metaphysical claim as well,

71
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,400
but I don't think it is.
I mean,

72
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:41,401
I've got thousands of letters now in the
last year from people who have told me 

73
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:46,630
that they were in a pit.
That's exactly right,

74
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,850
and that they decided that they were 
going to try to put their lives together

75
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,920
and that it worked and so that's really 
something,

76
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,450
you know,
when they write surprised,

77
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:58,900
it's like,
well,

78
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:03,901
I decided that I was going to work hard 
at what I was doing and I wasn't going 

79
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:04,570
to lie any more than absolutely 
necessary.

80
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,760
I thought I'd give it a try for a few 
months,

81
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:11,761
you know,
and all sorts of good things started to 

82
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:14,041
happen.
To me it's like maybe that's how the 

83
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,741
world works now.
Obviously it doesn't work like that all 

84
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:16,741
the time.
Right.

85
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:17,620
Because you can get sliced off at the 
knees.

86
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:22,621
I mean there's an arbitrary element to 
existence that's that you can't wish 

87
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:26,800
away,
but that doesn't mean that there are.

88
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,240
It doesn't mean that there aren't bad 
strategies and good strategies.

89
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,440
So I do think that one of the most 
fundamental existential questions is 

90
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,250
like,
if things are going well for you in your

91
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:44,251
life,
is are you absolutely certain that 

92
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:44,410
you're doing absolutely everything you 
can to put things in order?

93
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Because if you're not,
then you shouldn't complain because you 

94
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,621
don't know to what degree you're 
actually contributing or even causing 

95
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:52,900
the circumstance.
Now,

96
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:56,290
that's a very annoying thing to think,
and I'm not trying to blame the victim.

97
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,500
You know,
I know that people end up with lung 

98
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:01,500
cancer because they were exposed to 
asbestos.

99
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:01,900
You know,
I'm not trying to.

100
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Although I also know too that if you 
have lung cancer because you've been 

101
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,650
exposed to asbestos,
that can be a tragedy or can be hell.

102
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:13,651
And to some degree,
that depends on how you conduct 

103
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:13,651
yourself.
