1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,280
You know,
in,

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:03,930
in,
in sleeping beauty,

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,470
you know,
sleeping beauty goes to sleep and the 

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,550
reason she goes to sleep is because you 
have to remember what happens is she has

5
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:14,550
parents who were quite old and so 
they're pretty desperate to have a child

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,820
like so many people are now and they 
only have one child like so many people 

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,890
do now and they don't want anything to 
happen to this child because like,

8
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:27,891
hey,
it's a miracle and there's only one of 

9
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:30,351
them,
and so she's the princess and so it's 

10
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:30,450
like we're not letting anything around 
her.

11
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:32,190
So they have a big christening party,
right.

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:37,370
And they invite everybody but they don't
invite maleficent and Melissa sent is 

13
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:39,570
the terrible mother.
She's nature.

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,060
She's like the thing that goes bump in 
the night.

15
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:44,730
She's the devil herself,
so to speak.

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,400
She's everything that you don't want 
your child to encounter.

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,960
So the king and queen saying,
well,

18
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:50,490
we just want to invite her to the 
Christening.

19
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,090
It's like,
well,

20
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:53,640
good luck with that.
That's an eatable story,

21
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:58,641
right?
The eatable mother is the mother who 

22
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,670
devours her child by refusing,
by overprotecting him or her.

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,020
So that instead of being strengthened by
an encounter with the terrible world,

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,500
they're weakened by too much protection.
And then when they're lead out into the 

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:09,500
world,
they cannot live,

26
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,080
and that's the story of sleeping beauty 
and that's what the king and Queen do.

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,260
And they apologize to the,
to Melissa sent when she first shows up 

28
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,260
and say,
well,

29
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,920
you know,
they have a bunch of halfway did excuses

30
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:21,630
why they don't invite her.
We forgot.

31
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,950
It's like,
I don't think so.

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,830
You know,
you don't forget something like that.

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,410
And she kind of makes that point.
It's right.

34
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:29,880
The whole horror of life.

35
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,550
You don't forget about that when you 
have a child that's for sure.

36
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,110
You might wish that it would stay at 
bay,

37
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:36,150
but you do not forget about it.
The question is,

38
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:39,390
do you invite it to the party?
And the answer is it bloody well.

39
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,940
Depends how unconscious you want your 
child to be.

40
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,130
And if you want your child to be 
unconscious,

41
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:46,830
well then you have the added advantage 
that maybe they won't leave home.

42
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,920
And so you can take advantage of them 
for the rest of your sad life.

43
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:52,410
Instead of going off to find something 
to do for yourself,

44
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,190
well,
and then of course you can take revenge 

45
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,190
on them if they do have eddie,
Eddie,

46
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,911
what would you call impetus towards 
courage that you sacrificed yourself 30 

47
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:03,510
years ago and want to stamp out as soon 
as you see it develop in your child.

48
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,520
That's another thing that would be quite
pleasant,

49
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,010
and so that's what happens in sleeping 
beauty.

50
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah,
well,

51
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,240
none of this is pleasant and nothing 
that happens in that story is pleasant.

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,280
So sleeping beauty,
she's naive as hell.

53
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:19,281
They put her out in the forest and have 
a raised by these three like goody two 

54
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:22,521
shoes,
ferries that are also completely devoid 

55
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:22,521
of any real potency and power,
right?

56
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:24,330
There's no nothing maleficent about 
them.

57
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,880
And then the first idiot prints that 
wanders by,

58
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:31,881
she falls in love with so badly that she
has post traumatic stress disorder 

59
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:32,640
really writes off on his horse,
right?

60
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,100
That's what happens.
And then she,

61
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,550
then she goes into the castle and she's 
all freaked out because she met the love

62
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:41,070
of her life for like five minutes for 
God's sake.

63
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,170
And you know,
that's when the spinning wheel,

64
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:46,800
that's the wheel of fate pops up and she
picks her finger right?

65
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,390
They tried to get rid of all the 
spinning wheels,

66
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:51,060
they tried to get rid of all the wheels 
of fate with their pointed end,

67
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,330
but she finds it poke her fingers and 
finger falls down unconscious while she 

68
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,150
wants to be unconscious.

69
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,040
And no bloody wonder.
She was protected whole life.

70
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,070
She so damn naive that her first love 
affair just about kills her.

71
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,170
She wants to go to sleep and never wake 
up.

72
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,310
And so that's exactly what happens.
And then she has to wait for the prince 

73
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:10,330
to come and rescue her.
While you think,

74
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,850
how sexist can you get that story?
Well,

75
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,010
seriously,
because that's,

76
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,220
that's the way that that would be red.
And in the modern world it's like she 

77
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,651
doesn't need a prince to rescue her.
That's why Disney made frozen that 

78
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:23,230
absolutely appalling piece of rubbish.

79
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,410
So you know,
you can say,

80
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:37,411
you can say,
well the princess doesn't need a prince 

81
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:37,411
to rescue her,
but you know,

82
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:41,390
that's a boneheaded way of looking at 
the story because the prince isn't just 

83
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,730
a man who's coming to rescue the woman 
and believe me,

84
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:43,900
he's got his own problems,
right?

85
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:48,901
He's gonna,
hold God damn dragon he has to contend 

86
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:48,901
with.
But.

87
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:51,310
But the prince also represents the 
woman's own consciousness.

88
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:56,311
That consciousness is presented very 
frequently and stories as symbolically 

89
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:59,020
masculine as it is with the logos idea.
And the idea is that without,

90
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,530
without that forward going,
courageous consciousness,

91
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,770
a woman herself will drift into 
unconsciousness and terror and so you 

92
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,461
can read it as well.
The woman who's sleeping needs a man to 

93
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:13,120
wake her up and of course just like a 
man needs a woman to wake him up.

94
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,940
It's the same damn thing that's the 
dragon fight in sleeping beauty.

95
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,510
But it's also the case that if she's 
only unconscious,

96
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:24,070
all she can do is lay there and sleep 
the sleep of the naive and damned.

97
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,320
She has to wake up,
wake herself up,

98
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,550
and bring her own consciousness around 
masculine consciousness into the 

99
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,100
forefront so that she can survive in the
world.

100
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,320
And of course women are trying to do 
that like mad,

101
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,020
but that's partly what's represented in 
the store like that.

102
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,260
And that's partly what's implicit in 
this idea is that unless the woman is 

103
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,890
taken out of man,
so to speak,

104
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:47,740
then she isn't a human being.
She's just a creature.

105
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,220
And that's partly what's embedded in 
this story.

106
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,710
So you don't want to read it as a 
patriarchal.

107
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,310
You don't want to read anything that 
way.

108
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,680
So really it's really.
It's.

109
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,340
Yeah,
I won't,

110
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,250
I won't bother with that,
but really we can do better than that.

111
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,460
Man.
