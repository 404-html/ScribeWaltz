1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,480
What panksepp observed,
I think this is a brilliant piece of 

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,330
science,
is that first of all,

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,230
juvenile male routes in particular,
like too rough and tumble play,

4
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:13,980
they like to wrestle and they actually 
pin each other just like little kids do,

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:18,981
or like adult wrestlers do.
They pinned their shoulders down and 

6
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:19,860
that basically means you win.
And so okay,

7
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:21,960
so that's pretty cool.
But what's even cooler,

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,020
I think while there's three things,
one is the rats will work for an 

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,580
opportunity to get into an arena where 
they know that play might occur,

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,960
and so that's one of the scientific ways
of testing in animals motivation,

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,900
right?
So imagine you have a starving wrath and

12
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:39,780
it knows that it's got food down the end
of a corridor.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,990
You can put a little spring on its tail 
and measure how hard it pulls and that 

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,900
gives you an indication of it's 
motivational force.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,900
Now imagine the starving rat that's 
trying to get some food and you have a 

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,250
little spring on his tail and you walked
in some cat odor,

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,730
so now that route is starving and wants 
to get out of there.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,430
He's going to try to pull even farther 
towards the food,

19
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:03,270
so getting away plus getting forward are
separate motivational systems and if you

20
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:08,271
can add them together,
it's real potent and part of the reason 

21
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:12,320
why in the future authoring exercise 
that you guys are going to do as the 

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,711
class progresses,
you're asked to outline the place you'd 

23
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:15,711
like to end up,
which is your desired future,

24
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:20,631
and also the place that you could end up
if you let everything fall apart is so 

25
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:25,431
that your anxiety chases you and your 
approach systems pull you forward.

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,540
You're maximally motivated,
dead,

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,840
and it's important because otherwise you
can be afraid of pursuing the things 

28
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,120
that you want to pursue.

29
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,450
Right?
And that's very common and so then the 

30
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:38,790
fear inhibits you as the promise pulls 
you forward,

31
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,620
but it makes you weak because you're 
afraid.

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,350
You want to get your fear behind you,
pushing you,

33
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,590
and so what you want to be as afraid,
more afraid of not pursuing your goals 

34
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,160
than you are of pursuing them.
It's very,

35
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:55,161
very helpful and lots of times in life,
and this is something really worth 

36
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:55,730
knowing,
you know,

37
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,680
and this is one of the advantages to 
being an autonomous adult,

38
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:02,520
is you don't get to pick the best thing.
You get to pick your poison,

39
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,850
you have two bad choices and you get to 
pick which one you're willing to suffer 

40
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,510
through and every choice has a bit of 
that element in it.

41
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:14,511
And so if you know that,
it's really freeing because otherwise 

42
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:14,760
you torture yourself by thinking,
well,

43
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,310
maybe there's a good solution to this.

44
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,900
You know,
compared to the bad solution.

45
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:19,370
It's like,
Nah,

46
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:21,750
Nah.
Sometimes there's just risky solution,

47
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:26,751
one and risky solution to and sometimes 
both of them are really bad,

48
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,120
but you at least get to pick which one 
you're willing to suffer through and 

49
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,391
that's,
that actually makes quite a bit of 

50
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:36,870
difference because you're also facing it
voluntarily that instead of chasing you,

51
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:41,340
and that is an entire different entirely
different psychophysiological response.

52
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,430
Challenge versus threat.
It's not the same.

53
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,220
Even if the magnitude of the problem is 
the same.

54
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,380
And so putting yourself in a 
challenging,

55
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,350
let's call it mind frame,
you can't just do that by magic.

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,530
Putting yourself in a challenging 
mindframe is much,

57
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,950
much easier on you psychophysiological 
because you don't produce,

58
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,110
you don't go into the generalized stress
response to the same degree and you're 

59
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,861
activating your exploratory and seeking 
systems which are dopaminergic mediated 

60
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:08,980
and that involved positive emotion.

61
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,600
So if you can face something voluntarily
rather than having to chase you,

62
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,240
it's way better for you cycle 
physiologically.

63
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,120
So that's partly why.
Well,

64
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:24,121
it's worthwhile to go find the dragon in
its layer instead of waiting for it to 

65
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:24,990
come and eat.
So.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And especially when you also add the 
idea that if you go find the dragon and 

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,661
it's layer,
you might find it when it's a baby 

68
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:36,091
instead of a full fledged bloody monster
that is definitely going to take you 

69
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,570
down.
And so that's part of the reason why.

70
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,940
Well,
there's a whole bunch of things that,

71
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:42,730
that,
that emerge out of that observation.

72
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:46,000
Like don't avoid small problems that you
know,

73
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:51,001
are there,
face them because they'll grow into big 

74
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:52,180
problems all by themselves.
And you can think about,

75
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,150
imagine the Tax Department sends you a 
notification,

76
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,220
you owe them like $300.
Well it's,

77
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,980
you know,
that's annoying.

78
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,860
Maybe you don't even want to open the 
letter or maybe if you do,

79
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:07,870
you just put it on the shelf,
but that damn thing doesn't just sit 

80
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:07,870
there like a piece of paper on the 
shelf,

81
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,270
right?
You ignore that for five or six years.

82
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,480
It's going to be come attached to all 
sorts of horrible things and if you 

83
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:15,880
ignore it long enough,
you get the idea,

84
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,900
it's going to turn into something that 
is completely unlike the little piece of

85
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:22,780
paper that it's written on and,
and many,

86
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,150
many problems in life are like that.
You'll see they'll,

87
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,540
you'll see that they popped their ugly 
little handout that you know and you 

88
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,610
might want to turn away,
might want not want to think about it,

89
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,560
which is the easiest way of turning 
away,

90
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:37,060
right?
You just don't attend to it.

91
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,280
It's not like you repress it or anything
like that.

92
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,610
You just fail to attend to it.
And that's a really as a longterm 

93
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,670
strategy.
It's dismal.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's also something that I think that's 
more characteristic of people who are 

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,340
high in neuroticism and high in 
agreeableness.

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,600
Agreeable people don't like conflict and
people who are high in neuroticism,

97
00:04:55,601 --> 00:05:00,601
we were highly negative.
Emotion are hit harder per unit of 

98
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,440
uncertainty or threat,
and so you know,

99
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:07,441
and that's partly why in psychotherapy,
a lot of times the people you see need 

100
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:10,891
assertiveness training,
so that would be the opposite of 

101
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:13,021
agreeableness,
or they need to help get their anxiety 

102
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:13,040
and emotional pain under control.
It's.

103
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,640
Those are not the only reasons.
There's antisocial behavior,

104
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:18,100
but you can't fix that in therapy.
In all likelihood.

105
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:20,560
There's alcoholism.
There's lots of lots of other reasons,

106
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,030
but those are two major reasons.
