1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,360
So my question to you is a social 
contract or a legal system replaced 

2
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:09,310
religion as moral framework and a way we
are?

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,930
I think it's because it's because of the
gap between what we articulated and what

4
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:18,820
we don't know.
Something has to fill that gap.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,550
Like I think the law could be,
could,

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,370
could replace it if the law was total,
but it isn't.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,650
It's bounded and the incorrect and 
there's something in risks.

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,890
It has to rest on something inside 
that's like this mediator between what 

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,740
we articulate,
what we don't understand.

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,950
It's something like customer,
something like expectation.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,010
It's something like the intrinsic sense 
of justice,

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,990
you know that the law itself is aiming 
at and those aren't fully articulated,

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,240
but without them there'd be no 
grounding.

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,620
Like without the body,
the law would be a dictionary,

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,080
you know?
And if you don't know what a word means,

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,910
using the dictionary is helpful,
but not that helpful because like unless

17
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:03,260
you've had the experience of anger,
the dictionary,

18
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:06,730
I can't tell you what anger means,
it's just refers to other words,

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
but the words themselves refer to 
something else and the law refers to 

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,220
something else.

21
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,490
And without that it has to be in tune 
with that something else.

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,500
It has to be in accordance with it.
And so I don't think we can ever 

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,960
delineate the proper body of laws.
And that's also why you like ideological

24
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:30,571
utopias.
See the ideological utopia is dispensed 

25
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:31,930
with the transcendent.
They say,

26
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,420
this is what we need to do.
It's like,

27
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,650
no,
you don't.

28
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:37,120
No,
that's not good.

29
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:42,150
You have to leave space for what you 
kind of know and for what you don't 

30
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,750
know.
And I mean,

31
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,890
you know,
in the story of the Tower of Babel,

32
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:49,720
human beings make this massive building.
It's supposed to reach up to the heavens

33
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:51,940
so that it'll take the place of God.
Well,

34
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:56,941
that's,
that's the earliest warning we have of 

35
00:01:56,941 --> 00:02:00,630
the danger of making things so big that 
you confuse them with God and God gets 

36
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:06,211
irritated and comes down and makes 
everybody speak different languages and 

37
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:06,211
scatters them.

38
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:06,211
It's like,
well,

39
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:10,621
that's what happens when you try to make
something a totality is that it starts 

40
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:14,300
to fragment inside and disintegrates 
into catastrophe and so it's,

41
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,240
it's almost as if we have to maintain 
this articulated space inside the dream,

42
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:21,490
inside the custom,
something like that,

43
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:26,491
because otherwise it doesn't work.
And I think that's the same as having 

44
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:26,710
respect for the fact that we have 
bodies.

45
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,030
You know,
we're not just abstract creatures that 

46
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,030
follow rules.
We're not that at all.

47
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,990
We only follow certain rules.
We won't follow the other ones and our 

48
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,950
societies will crumble.
And so,

49
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,410
and we just don't know enough to 
articulate the entire landscape of 

50
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,570
behavior with articulated rules.
Not at all.

51
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,250
We can't do it.
It's beyond us.

52
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,080
Yep.
Yep.
