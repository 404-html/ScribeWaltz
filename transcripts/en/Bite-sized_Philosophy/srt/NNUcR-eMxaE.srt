1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,320
The idea of cultural appropriation is 
absolute nonsense.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,040
That's that.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,510
No,
there's no difference between cultural 

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:15,510
appropriation and learning from one 
another.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,900
It does the same thing.
Now,

6
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:21,901
that doesn't mean I can't.
That doesn't mean that there's no theft 

7
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:23,720
between people.
There is no,

8
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:27,430
and it doesn't mean that just because 
you encounter someone else's ideas,

9
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:30,580
you have an immediate right to those 
ideas as if they were your own,

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,650
but the idea that manifesting in your 
own behavior,

11
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:40,651
some element of another culture,
the idea that that's somehow immoral is 

12
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:42,530
insane.
It's actually one of the bases of peace.

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,730
You know,
one of the things that the various 

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,861
groups of human beings that exist have 
to offer each other is the tremendous 

15
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:51,000
value of their culture.
You know,

16
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,200
it's been really interesting to me,
for example,

17
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:57,600
to watch the response of,
of ball of everyone,

18
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,240
but for this argument to you,
for young Caucasian males to hip hop,

19
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,050
you know,
there's an aggressiveness about hip hop 

20
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,031
that's really attractive to young 
Caucasian males and there's something 

21
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:09,031
observed about,
about the,

22
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,460
the spectacle of the young Caucasian 
males taking on the persona of inner 

23
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:17,660
city black gang members.
You know,

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,310
but,
but I'm sympathetic to it because there 

25
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,481
is an aggressiveness to that,
to that art form that's a necessary 

26
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:30,241
corrective to the insistence that the 
highest moral virtue for a modern man is

27
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:33,550
harmlessness,
which is observed.

28
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,550
Women don't even like harmless man.
They hate them.

29
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,920
Okay.
Flog them apart.

30
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,300
What,
what

31
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,120
are dangerous men who are civilized and 
they want to help civilize them

32
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,140
beauty and the beast.
So,

33
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:57,141
you know,
I'll tell you a funny story and only 

34
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:57,141
engineers could have come up with this 
because they are the only ones that have

35
00:01:57,141 --> 00:02:01,901
the unparalleled blindness to social 
convention that would allow them to 

36
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:04,430
discover it.
So the Google engineers,

37
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:06,890
I like engineered by the way because 
they're very straightforward.

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,120
The Google engineers wrote a book awhile
back called a billion wicked thoughts,

39
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:14,720
which was a study of Internet searches,
billions of them literally,

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,240
and they were looking a lot of 
pornography use.

41
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:19,880
And while there's lots of known about 
male pornography use,

42
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:24,881
partly and it's easy to understand.
I mean males are pretty visually 

43
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:28,400
oriented in what attracts them to 
pornography is fairly straightforward.

44
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,360
You can tell that if you look at 
graffiti and a men's washroom,

45
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:37,361
you know it's like two circles in the 
triangle and the men are absolutely 

46
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:37,370
transfixed.

47
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:42,710
Bye.

48
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,280
The story is more complex.
They use pornography too,

49
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:59,040
but it tends to be literary because 
women tend to like words more.

50
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,170
They like visual stimuli and so the 
Google guys tried to track down the 

51
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,040
archetypal structure of how they didn't 
use those words a female pornography 

52
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,031
use.
And so some of you know how many of you 

53
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:13,090
know what a Harlequin romance is.
Okay,

54
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,250
good.
So those are archetypal stories,

55
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,230
right?
That's the taming of the wild man.

56
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,200
Essentially by the,
by the desirable and virgin a woman.

57
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:24,250
And if you think women don't want that,
then you better bloody well come up with

58
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:27,420
an explanation for 50 shades of grey.
Right?

59
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,430
Which is the most,
the most rapid selling novel in human 

60
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,221
history and emerged at exactly the same 
time that all of this noise about the 

61
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:38,620
lack of the absence of gender roles is 
being produced on Mohs.

62
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,070
It's like perfect female fantasy.
It's exactly archetypally correct.

63
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:47,071
It's beauty and the beast.
So what the deal guys showed was the 

64
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:51,421
structure of beauty and the beast,
although they didn't use that as a 

65
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:53,020
reference that the female pornographic 
fantasy was wild guy,

66
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,090
you know,
somewhat careless about the wants and 

67
00:03:59,090 --> 00:03:59,090
desires of others attractive to 
everyone.

68
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,040
Therefore,
high status,

69
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,150
tamed by the magic of a single woman and
brought into a relationship with her.

70
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,110
Okay.
So,

71
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,570
but here's the comical part.
This just made me laugh,

72
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,290
man.
It was like,

73
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,530
what were the five categories of most 
desirable male entity used most broadly 

74
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:15,850
and female pornography?
Oh,

75
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,350
it's so embarrassing.
Women,

76
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:22,351
you have to cover your head.
Will I say this because Vampire 

77
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,620
Werewolf,
billionaire surgeon and pirate.
