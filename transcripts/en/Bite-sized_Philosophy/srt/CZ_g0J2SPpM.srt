1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,110
People wish upon a star because they 
have some intuition that aiming above 

2
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:09,860
the mundane has the potential to 
transform themselves.

3
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:11,600
They make a wish.
Well,

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,650
if you're gonna,
make a wish.

5
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:20,651
You should aim at something high and 
even just aiming at that is more likely 

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,340
to make the wish come true and this is 
not a metaphor.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,860
You know,
I have this program which you guys are 

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,300
going to do called the future authoring 
program is one of two assignments.

9
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:35,690
One is that you write an autobiography.
That's the past authoring.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,330
The other is that you write a plan for 
the future.

11
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:43,331
That's the future authoring.
I would recommend that you get started 

12
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:43,331
on those right now,
like not right now,

13
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:48,071
but like really soon because they're 
harder than you think and some of you 

14
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:49,970
are going to write like 15,000
words.

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,390
You're going to get sucked right in.
This happens all the time.

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,450
You're going to get sucked right into it
and so you write an autobiography 

17
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,651
because you need to know where you are 
and who you are right now because how 

18
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:04,370
the hell are you going to plot a pathway
to the future?

19
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:09,371
Unless you know where you are and then 
you need to write about the future 

20
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:10,550
because you going to hit something 
unless he aim at it,

21
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,270
that's for sure.
And lots of times people won't admit 

22
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,540
what they want because they're afraid.
The reason they're afraid is because if 

23
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,991
you specify what you want,
you've specified your conditions of 

24
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:27,111
failure.
You know when you fail and it's better 

25
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:27,111
just to keep it foggy.
It's like,

26
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:32,031
well,
I don't know if I'm succeeding or 

27
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:32,031
failing,
but you know,

28
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:32,031
I can't really tell while.
Great.

29
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,040
Except you can't hit anything you don't 
aim at.

30
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,700
And so the future authoring program is 
like a,

31
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,300
it's a,
an attempt to have you articulate your 

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,300
character.
And so as the past authoring program,

33
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,640
who are you and you know,
the past authoring program and asked you

34
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:54,250
to break your life into the parks and 
then to write about the emotional,

35
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,730
you know,
the things that you regard as important 

36
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,750
important events that have shaped who 
you are and you know,

37
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:06,751
you may find that some of those,
some of that writing makes you 

38
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,011
emotional.
I would say if you have a memory that's 

39
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:09,560
more than 18 months old roughly 
speaking,

40
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:13,190
and when you bring it to mind it,
it has an emotional impact,

41
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:15,450
especially in negative emotional impact.
There's.

42
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,460
It's like part of your soul is stuck 
back there and I know that's a 

43
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,070
metaphorical way of thinking about it,
but what I mean is that

44
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,740
the reason that you still experience the
emotion is because you have not solved 

45
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,730
the problem that that situation face do 
with.

46
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,740
It might be a real problem.
Like maybe you got tangled up with 

47
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:38,740
someone who was really bad and that's 
rough man,

48
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,601
because you got to come up with a theory
of malevolence to deal with something 

49
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:46,430
like that and that's no joke,
but if it's still produces emotion,

50
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:49,410
it means you haven't solved the problem 
and and your.

51
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,620
Your brain is still pegging it as 
threat.

52
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:56,621
It's,
it's a part of your territory that you 

53
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:56,621
did not master threat,
threat,

54
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:56,621
threat,
threat,

55
00:02:56,621 --> 00:03:00,971
threat,
and until you take it apart and 

56
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,620
articulation really helps,
that writing really helps that then 

57
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,910
you're not going to free yourself from 
its grip and that what might not be that

58
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:11,911
pleasant.
I mean this is one of those situations 

59
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:14,191
were doing,
it tends to produce a detriment in 

60
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:17,110
people's mood in the short term,
but quite radical improvements,

61
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,380
three to six months down the road,
you know,

62
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,390
and it's often the case that you 
unfortunately have to do something you 

63
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,640
don't want to do in order to progress.

64
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,590
It's very,
very common.

65
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,370
So in the future authoring program asks 
you about different dimensions of your 

66
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,480
life,
like because you're,

67
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,930
you know,
you can think of yourself as a 

68
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,131
personality inside your head,
but your nested in systems that 

69
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,810
transcend you and they're just as real 
as whatever's in your head.

70
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:45,040
It's like,
well,

71
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,370
what do you need for life?
Well,

72
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,730
that's pretty easy actually.
Some friends,

73
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,820
that's a good thing.
Intimate relationship,

74
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,580
that's a good thing.
Family,

75
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,610
you know either the one you're going to 
produce or the one that you come from 

76
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,230
where people to some degree of love and 
care for one another.

77
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,250
That's a good thing to work on.
You need,

78
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,600
you need some plan for your career.
You've got to fit in somewhere that 

79
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,651
people regard as important and that 
they'll trade with you so that you can 

80
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:18,730
live.
You need something worthwhile to do with

81
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:23,350
the time that you're not at work and you
need to pay attention to your mental and

82
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:27,400
physical health and you need to regulate
your use of substances,

83
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,970
which is a strange one,
but alcohol does lots of people in so 

84
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:32,970
it's worth.

85
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,490
It's worth thinking about.
That's why we put it in there,

86
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,540
so then it's like,
okay,

87
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,690
what the hell do you want?
What do you want from your friends?

88
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,720
What do you want from your family?
What do you want from your career?

89
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,390
If you could have what you want to.
That's what the program asks you.

90
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,810
Three to five years down the road,
you get to have what you want.

91
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,500
Now I'm assuming that you're going to 
approach this like,

92
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,210
you know,
reasonable adults and not like 13 year 

93
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,161
old dreamers.
I think I want the most expensive yacht 

94
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:00,010
in the world.
It's like fine,

95
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:05,011
but you know,
that isn't really what it's supposed to 

96
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:08,941
be more concentrating on your character 
and so then it asks you to write for 15 

97
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:15,001
minutes without thinking too much about 
grammar or sentence structure.

98
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:20,221
Any of that,
but what your life could be like three 

99
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:23,410
to five years down the road if you were 
treating yourself like someone you cared

100
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:28,411
for and you were helping them figure out
what they wanted and then it asks you to

101
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:34,141
do the same thing in reverse,
which is to think about the ways that 

102
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:39,511
you're radically insufficient and your 
faults and everyone knows this.

103
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,930
I think,
you know,

104
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,770
maybe not,
but everyone has a sense of if they were

105
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:47,140
going to degenerate,
how they would do it.

106
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,940
You know,
some people would be an alcoholic,

107
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:53,941
some people would be a street person.
It's like there's some doom thing out 

108
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:57,541
there that's got your name on it.
If you're particularly in cautious and 

109
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,390
you know,
don't.

110
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,800
And let things fall apart,
so want you to write about that.

111
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,370
What do you not want to have happened in
three to five years?

112
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,650
And there's psychological reasons for 
this.

113
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:13,040
A one is if you have something to aim 
for,

114
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:18,041
that's a source of positive emotion 
because your positive emotion is mostly 

115
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,780
generated by evidence that you're moving
towards something that you value.

116
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,670
It's not generated so much by 
accomplishing something because when you

117
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,680
accomplish something,
you're just left with the problem of 

118
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:29,680
whatever you're going to do next.

119
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:29,780
So you graduate from university.
It's like,

120
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,790
you know,
Hooray.

121
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,290
One day you're at the peak of your 
undergraduate university career.

122
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:41,000
The next day you're unemployed and 
looking for a bad job at starbucks.

123
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,350
So,
you know,

124
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,630
well you see what I mean is,
you know,

125
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:45,250
it's,
it's that,

126
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,800
you know,
one problem that you solve is replaced 

127
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,141
by another problem.
And so the idea that you're going to be 

128
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:55,040
happy when you solve all your problems,
it's like good luck with that theory.

129
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,590
But,
but you know,

130
00:06:57,591 --> 00:07:02,591
if you're aiming at something worthwhile
and you really believe it's worthwhile 

131
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:02,591
and you've thought it through,
you know,

132
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:04,340
so that you're not weak,
you're not weak,

133
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,290
you've got your damn arguments,
my mustard.

134
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,450
Then when you make progress even a 
little bit,

135
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:08,930
you think,
hey,

136
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,700
that's all right,
and you get a little kick,

137
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:16,030
a little dopamine kick,
and that's what you want because that's 

138
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,030
where your positive emotion comes from.

139
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,620
You can use cocaine if you want,
but,

140
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,060
but you know,
that tends to have relatively 

141
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,980
detrimental medium to longterm 
consequences,

142
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:30,130
but it activates the same system.
So you have to be aiming at something 

143
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,930
and you should be aiming at something 
that's realistic that you want,

144
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,300
that you could get,
you know,

145
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,670
like,
not easily because if it's easy,

146
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,440
in some sense you've already got it.
It's got to push you.

147
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,590
And that's part of the pleasure 
actually,

148
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,591
because there's two things that you want
to do when you're pursuing something 

149
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,100
that's important and one of them is to 
get the thing that's important.

150
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,340
But the other is,
is to make yourself better at pursuing 

151
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:54,340
things.
Right?

152
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,990
So,
so you can get both of those at the same

153
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:58,220
time you,
you,

154
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,830
you're aiming at something and you're 
increasing your competence.

155
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:05,831
It's like that's a good deal.
That's a good deal and there's a lot of 

156
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:09,830
intrinsic meaning to be felt in that and
then the second half of the program you,

157
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,270
you write out a plan for how you're 
going to do it and how you're going to 

158
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,301
keep yourself on track and you're going 
to write about why it would be good for 

159
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:22,181
you if you did this and why it would be 
good for your family and what possible 

160
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:24,680
benefits it would have to the community 
because you want to nail this thing down

161
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:29,681
and then you want to figure out what 
kind of obstacles are going to come up 

162
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:32,090
and how you might overcome them and how 
you might keep yourself on track and all

163
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:32,450
of that.

164
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,450
And we know because we've actually done 
a lot of research on this particular 

165
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,471
program that if university students do 
this and this is more true.

166
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:45,050
If they're not too well oriented to 
begin with.

167
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,560
If University students do this,
they're about 25 percent less likely to 

168
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,120
drop out,
which is lot and about their grade point

169
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:57,750
average increases about 20 percent.
So Hooray for that,

170
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,780
you know,
because you never know when you develop 

171
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:02,780
an intervention,
if it's gonna work,

172
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,960
there's also evidence but not from my 
lab.

173
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,590
That doing such things improves your 
physical health and I think the reason 

174
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,690
for that is that,
you know,

175
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:13,740
when you go over your autobiography and 
you scour out those negative places that

176
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:18,741
you're sort of dragging along with you,
it lowers your overall stress load 

177
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:23,360
because your brain is kinda.
I think it's calculating how dangerous 

178
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,751
the world is by attending to the ratio 
of successes to failures that you've had

179
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,670
in your life.
Something like that.

180
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:34,671
And so you know,
if there are holes in your map that you 

181
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:37,911
could still fall through,
then your brain regards the territory 

182
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,220
still as a bit on the dangerous side and
then you more prepared for emergency 

183
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,131
action and that's hard on you.
So you want to go back there and fix up 

184
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:49,590
those experiences is to the degree that 
you can't.
