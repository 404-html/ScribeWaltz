1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,990
The fundamental assumptions of Western 
civilization are valid.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,190
How about that?
You know,

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,040
it's not.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,110
You think it's an accident.
Oh,

5
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:15,760
here's how you find out,
okay.

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,520
Which countries do people want to move 
away from?

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,170
Hey,
not ours.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,280
Which countries do people want to move 
two hours.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,460
Guess what?
They work better and it's not because we

10
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,170
went around the world stealing 
everything.

11
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:32,920
We could get our hands on it because we 
got certain fundamental assumptions.

12
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:34,840
Right?
Thank God for that.

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,560
After thousands and thousands of years 
of trying and because of that,

14
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:42,880
we've managed to establish a set of 
civilizations that are shining lights in

15
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:44,020
the world.
You know,

16
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:47,920
now you can be pretty damn filthy and 
still be a shining light in this world,

17
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:52,921
right?
Because if you look around the world at 

18
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:55,021
the state of governance in most places,
it's like the most pathological corrupt 

19
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:59,050
and vicious thugs rule.
And to stand out as an illuminated light

20
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:01,030
against that background is it so 
difficult?

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,350
But nonetheless,
you know,

22
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,550
we're as good as it's gone and unless we
can come up with something better,

23
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:08,950
we should be very careful about messing 
around with that.

24
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,070
So why don't we start with the 
assumption that we're doing something 

25
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,070
right?
One of the things we're doing right,

26
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,391
for example,
is that we actually value the 

27
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:18,391
individual,
right?

28
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:20,890
The individual has intrinsic value in 
western societies.

29
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:26,070
Do you know how long it took people to 
formulate that as an idea and how 

30
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,280
unlikely that ideas that poor you,
you know,

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,150
useless,
powerless you with all your damn fault,

32
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,020
you're actually worth something.
You're worth something to the point that

33
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:37,960
the law has to respect you.
God,

34
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,650
we don't want to abandon that for some 
half witted collectivism,

35
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:46,651
which we're doing as rapidly as possible
because one of the things that 

36
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:49,900
characterizes the radical left types is 
they don't give a damn about you as an 

37
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,190
individual or about individuals at all.

38
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,240
You're black or you're white or you're 
Latino or you're transsexual,

39
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:58,540
you're homosexual or whatever.
You're a group.

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,600
You're a member of a group,
and the only thing that matters is the 

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:03,600
group.
Well,

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,440
I can tell you if the only thing that 
matters is the group,

43
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,790
you bloody well don't matter very much.
And then you've got to ask yourself just

44
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,520
exactly what sort of people are trying 
to set things up.

45
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:16,360
So it is that the individual doesn't 
matter very much.

46
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,510
Well,
it's the sort of people to whom the 

47
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,551
individual doesn't matter very much and 
I might suggest that you don't elect 

48
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:27,541
them and that when they attempt to take 
power that you do everything you can to 

49
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:27,541
stop them.
