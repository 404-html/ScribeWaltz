1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,850
Did you guys ever see the Blair witch 
project?

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,960
How many of you have seen that?
How many of you haven't?

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,270
Oh,
so it's a pretty lousy example.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,700
Anyways,
it's a horror movie now.

5
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:13,260
There's kind of two kinds of horror 
movies.

6
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:17,640
There's the splatter type horror movie 
and I think actually those expose you to

7
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:22,641
discuss and then there's the fear kind 
of horror movie and that doesn't need to

8
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:25,920
have any Gore at all.
It just makes you afraid.

9
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:30,921
And the Blair witch project is very good
example of that because all that 

10
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:30,921
happens,
nothing happens,

11
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:35,810
nothing happens,
but you think something terrible is 

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,661
going to happen every second and the 
sense that something terrible is gonna 

13
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:42,321
happen,
keeps climbing through the whole movie 

14
00:00:42,321 --> 00:00:44,330
and so what they do is put you in a 
state of radical uncertainty and never 

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,240
let you off.
Okay,

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,510
well,
so basically they're playing with your 

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:50,510
imagination and that can work very 
effectively.

18
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,920
Like it's often horror movies,
often more effective if they don't show 

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,050
you what's making those horrible noises 
off screening,

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,310
you know,
because no matter what they show you,

21
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:04,311
the probability that he can be as 
personally horrible as what other 

22
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:06,450
monsters you're dredging up out of your 
imagination is very low.

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,130
So,
and you know,

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,150
what's reasonable to be afraid of the 
dark because throughout our biological 

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,140
history,
lots of unfortunate people were devoured

26
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:18,570
by things in the dark or hurt very badly
by them,

27
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,710
etc.
Etc.

28
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,620
And wE're also daytime creatures,
right?

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,080
So we don't like the dark very much.
So what do you do to someone if you're 

30
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:31,800
going to initiate them is maybe you take
them when they're 13 and you put them in

31
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:35,940
a really dark cave and caves.
There Are so dark man,

32
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,790
like if you're in a cave,
you just can't believe how dark it is.

33
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,510
It's,
it's.

34
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,810
You can't see anything in a cave.
So you don't know how big the space 

35
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,920
you're in is and you don't know how 
small it is and you don't know whether 

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,240
or not it's going to collapse or when 
it's going to stay up.

37
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,680
And you don't know how far you are 
underground,

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,100
especially if the people who took you 
there didn't,

39
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,290
you know,
walked around in circles and did let you

40
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:03,291
know where you were going and then maybe
they leave and maybe they leave for 

41
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:07,071
three days.
And so you're sitting down there 

42
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:07,071
thinking,
well,

43
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:07,200
what are you thinking?
Exactly?

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,280
Well,
you're thinking the most horrible 

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,280
thoughts you could possibly imagine,
right?

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,230
I'm never going to get out of here.
They're never going to find me again.

47
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,060
some horrible snake thing that lives in 
the darkness is going to come and eat me

48
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:26,061
slowly because fast would be merciful 
and I'm and then I'm also going to go 

49
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,990
completely out of my mind so that even 
if something doesn't eat me,

50
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:35,991
I'm going to come over here.
it will be worse than being dead 

51
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:38,061
anyways.
And so partly what you're doing in that 

52
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:40,510
circumstances,
you're facing that demons of your own 

53
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:40,510
imagination.

54
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,600
And if you can stand that,
then you grow up.

55
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,650
And that's what an initiation ceremony 
tests.

56
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,810
Now,
a lot of what you'll find if you look at

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,840
clinical theories of psychology,
the same motif applies if you want to 

58
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:59,361
get better,
you have to find out what you're 

59
00:02:59,361 --> 00:03:01,431
avoiding and what you're afraid of and 
maybe what you're by you and you have to

60
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,400
expose yourself to that voluntarily and 
you have to let that change you,

61
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,190
and so it's not a pleasant prospect.
I mean,

62
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,640
it's not dancing through a field of 
daisies,

63
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,510
right?
With muzak play and it'S not follow your

64
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:18,070
bliss.
You know?

65
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,280
It's not the natural unfolding of a 
positive process.

66
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:26,281
It's not that at all.
It's the voluntary confrontation with 

67
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:28,981
the things that make up life horrors.
But what's interesting about it is that 

68
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:32,890
there's.
There's an idea there that lurks under 

69
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,091
the surface archetypally,
and that is there's a lot more to you 

70
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:40,051
than meets the eye,
but it won't be released unless it has 

71
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:43,591
to,
and so you're not going to even figure 

72
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:43,591
out what it is until you put yourself in
peril.

73
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Now,
part of that you might think like 

74
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:48,720
imagine that you're.
You're an introvert.

75
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,990
You're socially awkward,
you're highly neurotic,

76
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,790
so you feel a lot of anxiety and 
depression.

77
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:55,120
You don't like going to partieS.
That's because the horrible pirate lives

78
00:03:55,121 --> 00:04:00,121
at parties and always glaring at you and
judging you and telling you how useless 

79
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:02,080
and insufficient you are.
And so you go there.

80
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:05,590
You don't even look at people because 
you know that if you did look at them,

81
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:07,870
you just see the face of the judgmental 
tyrant,

82
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,900
which by the way,
you wouldn't if you actually looked at 

83
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,421
them,
but you won't because you avoid and so 

84
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,971
you're going to go there and you're 
going to put yourself in this terrible 

85
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:17,971
situation and if you're lucky and you're
a bit of weight,

86
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:22,770
then you're going to incorporate all 
sorts of information from the external 

87
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,371
world that will help you develop your 
social skills and make you more 

88
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:26,371
sophisticated.

89
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,300
And even if that doesn't happen,
you're going to learn that.

90
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,030
You can tolerate your own fear.
And you might say,

91
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:36,031
well,
what's better to not be afraid or to 

92
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:39,190
know that you can handle being afraid 
and obviously to not be afraid,

93
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,790
but give that up because that ain't 
happening so that the next best thing 

94
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,830
and the realistic thing is to know that 
you're the master of your own fear.

95
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,910
And so a lot of what we're going to talk
about in relationship to classical 

96
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,230
theories of personality is exactly that.
It's not that the world isn't terrible,

97
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,030
it's that the world is terrible,
but you're a lot stronger than you think

98
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,320
and the way you.
Okay?

99
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:07,321
And so part of that is the strength that
you gather is partly the information 

100
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:08,830
that you gather when you go somewhere 
that you're not good at.

101
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:13,831
You know,
so you're establishing new skills like 

102
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:13,831
you haven't university.

103
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,190
But there's another part that's 
interesting that's related to the little

104
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,870
video that I showed you at the 
beginning.

105
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,480
Dna turns out to be a very complex 
structure.

106
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,840
And so if I put you in situation a,
then dna codes,

107
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:29,841
certain kinds of proteins that help make
up the way that your mind is in the way 

108
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:30,760
it works.
But if I take you and put you in another

109
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:33,580
situation,
completely different genes turn on,

110
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,480
and so what that means is that you have 
a biological repository of potential use

111
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,660
lying dormant at the highest resolution 
level of your molecular structure,

112
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,540
and that if you push yourself and all 
sorts of different directions and you 

113
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,690
find different things to pursue and test
yourself against,

114
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,840
then you're going to turn on parts of 
yourself that aren't currently on and 

115
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,540
god only knows what you'd be like.
If you turned yourself completely on.

116
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,210
Maybe I could use a better metaphor.

117
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,370
I'll tell you a little bit more about 
the shavano routines because they're 

118
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,210
more in a way,
if there is a initiation archetype,

119
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,240
which I kind of just described,
which is you can do this for yourself 

120
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,320
and this is a good way to live.
BeaTs the alternative anyway.

121
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,340
So which is like the definition of a 
good way to live so mad and you're 

122
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,250
trying to pursue something so you've got
a goal.

123
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:49,251
That's a good thing.
You've got to have a goal and you don't 

124
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:49,251
want to hold onto that too tightly 
because he might be wrong.

125
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,990
You've got to be willing to let that go 
and have a different goal,

126
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:55,080
but you need to go and then you know 
while you're pursuing the goal,

127
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,630
you're going to find out that there's 
some obstacles in your path,

128
00:06:57,631 --> 00:07:02,631
obviously,
and maybe some of those obstacles are 

129
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:02,631
afraid,
frightening,

130
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:02,631
tight.

131
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,510
Well,
maybe the reason of a disgusting type,

132
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,540
you might say,
I don't want to turn it into that kind 

133
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,551
of person,
so those of you who are sort of 

134
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:11,550
socialist utopia had left wingers might 
think that way about business people.

135
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,480
It's like,
I wouldn't.

136
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,510
I would recommend that you get over it 
as rapidly as possible.

137
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,390
So anyways,
you might think there's no way I'm going

138
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:22,520
to act that way.
So you sort of put it off limits saying,

139
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,410
or maybe you're afraid to do what you 
need to do next.

140
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,210
Well,
here's the rule.

141
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,640
Don't avoid doing things because they 
make you feel negative emotion.

142
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,670
If you have to do those things in order 
to pursue your goals,

143
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,980
in fact,
you should do exactly the opposite.

144
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,040
So let's say you're pursuing a goal and 
you find that you're afraid about 

145
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,191
something and so you're avoiding it.
The first thing you should think is a 

146
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:46,191
hot look.

147
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:47,910
I'm afraid of something and I'm avoiding
it.

148
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,650
Dragon treasure.
Exactly there.

149
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,380
And that's exactly right.
It's precisely right.

150
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,870
If you're.
If you're afraid of the thing,

151
00:07:57,871 --> 00:08:02,871
then what that means is that you're not 
developed enough to handle it and you 

152
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:06,021
need to be.
So you should think about that as a 

153
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:06,021
discovery,
like a positive discovery.

154
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:09,480
You found out where you have a weakness 
and you're now able to address it.

155
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,270
So you know if you're an introvert and 
you think it's friday night,

156
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:14,490
I could go to this party,
but you know I really don't want it.

157
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,960
Then you think,
oh,

158
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,190
that means I should go.
And that's exactly right because

159
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,870
because you already know how to do the 
things that you know how to do and it's 

160
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,340
the things that you don't know how to do
that bother you and oppress you.

161
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:35,590
And of course those things are going to 
be difficult to learn about,

162
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:40,591
but you need to learn about them because
you need to get yourself all switched 

163
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:40,660
on.
How's that switched on?

164
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,130
Because then you'll be able to tolerate 
the fact that life is fundamentally 

165
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,930
suffering and so you don't know.
The world doesn't get safer us.

166
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:51,850
You developed,
in fact quite the contrary.

167
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,970
You just get more competent and that's 
better anyways because it's that you 

168
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,490
don't want safety anyways.
You probably want adventure.

169
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,630
You probably want to be compelled.
You probably want to be engaged.

170
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,010
You know,
if you want security,

171
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:10,011
you might as well be dead well because 
nothing's happening then and that 

172
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:10,011
there's no danger level.

173
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,800
To be alive is to be contending with 
the,

174
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,760
with the world and you want to be the 
best at that that you can possibly be.

175
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,240
And that's partly what we're gonna learn
about as we go through the entire 

176
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,691
course.
But certainly the elements that have to 

177
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,350
do with clinical psychology because all 
of the circulate around this fundamental

178
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,310
fee,
they have to.

179
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:34,311
Because it's the fundamental story of 
mankind and we want to know what that 

180
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:37,710
fundamental story is because we're all 
human and you need to know the story and

181
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:42,711
then you know,
you can decide how you're gonna act it 

182
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:44,781
out,
but at least you need to know the damn 

183
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:44,781
story first.
