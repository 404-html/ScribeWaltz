1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,330
You're in a class,
it's near the beginning of the semester.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,510
You write an exam or you handed in an 
essay and you don't get the mark that 

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:08,510
you desired.
Okay,

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,350
so what are your options?
One option would be,

5
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:15,351
so you've hit an anomaly.
Things didn't happen the way you wanted 

6
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:16,080
them to happen and so maybe you say,
Geez,

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,120
that was a boring and stupid class.
Anyways,

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,240
this gives me an excuse to get out and 
so that's not such a negative thing or 

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,291
you think,
oh well I really better buckle down and 

10
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:27,291
study and you just started to stay in 
the class.

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,060
So basically what you've done is 
maintained your framework.

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,660
I'm going to work through this class,
but you're,

13
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,490
you're,
you've decided to modify some of the sub

14
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:38,400
routines that make up that frame.
You say,

15
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:43,401
well I should study more next time or I 
have to prioritize this class compared 

16
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:47,001
to other classes.
So it's a micro alteration within the 

17
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:50,030
overarching framework.
But another thing you can do is say to 

18
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:52,120
hell with the class.
I just won't.

19
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,140
I'll just drop it.

20
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,210
And so the advantage to that is problem 
gone.

21
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,420
The disadvantages,
well now you have a different problem 

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:03,420
which is,
okay,

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:03,430
fine,
you drop the class,

24
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,680
do you have another class that you can 
replace it with?

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,070
Is that a good way of dealing with micro
failure,

26
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,630
you know,
to move up a level of analysis and throw

27
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,110
throughout the whole frame because you 
could also say,

28
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:19,111
well maybe I should just drop out of 
university and maybe I should go hang 

29
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:19,111
myself.
You know,

30
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:19,390
that's.
Well,

31
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,540
it's the same line of logic.
It's just taken up to a higher degree of

32
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:27,541
abstraction and so generally speaking 
you don't want to solve a problem by 

33
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,030
moving up a level in wiping out the 
frame within which the problem was 

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,330
experienced.
Do you want to do that carefully?

35
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:39,331
Because in principle,
the frame that you were working within 

36
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:42,840
had already.
You'd already assigned value to it and 

37
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:42,840
worked at it.
You've already invested in it.

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,010
It's a big sacrifice to blow out the 
whole frame.

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,220
Now sometimes you can do it.
So anyways,

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,540
what happens is,
well,

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,690
you get the bad grade and you're upset 
about it,

42
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,530
and so you've been plunged from your 
happy,

43
00:01:56,531 --> 00:02:00,250
satiated state.
Let's say into a state of relative chaos

44
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,260
and the chaos is,
oh,

45
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:07,830
I hit an obstacle,
I didn't expect it and now I don't know 

46
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,861
what to do,
and so what does it mean to not know 

47
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:10,861
what to do?
Well,

48
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,060
it can mean I need to study harder.
It can mean I should drop this course.

49
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:20,100
It can mean I should major in a 
different subject.

50
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,200
I mean maybe I shouldn't be in 
university.

51
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,950
It could mean maybe my future plans have
been formulated badly.

52
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:30,951
It can mean my future plans had been 
formulated badly because I don't 

53
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,090
understand myself very well and I've 
been telling lies about my past.

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,120
Right?
The thing can really expand on you and 

55
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,601
that's what the chaotic domain is.
That's the real manifestation of those 

56
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:42,900
things that you had considered 
irrelevant,

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,960
right?
Because when you go to pick up the exam,

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,070
you've got your identity as a competent 
student intact.

59
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,080
You're not questioning whether you 
should be in the course or whether you 

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,200
should be in that major or whether you 
should be in university.

61
00:02:55,201 --> 00:03:00,201
None of that.
That's all in the implicitly accepted 

62
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:01,690
category and as soon as the anomalous 
event emerges,

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,560
all of those things that you had 
rendered axiomatic start to become 

64
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,960
questionable and that's like the shark 
coming up out,

65
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:15,961
coming up from the depths to pull you 
down and that's the classic way of 

66
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:16,870
representing that and symbolizing it.

67
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,870
That's Jonah and the whale for example,
so it's something is manifested itself 

68
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,450
from the deep unknown and pulls you 
under like an alligator at a,

69
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:30,570
at a waterhole,
which is I'm sure one of the sources 

70
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,691
from which we derived that particular 
kind of mythological representation 

71
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:36,850
because you could imagine that when we 
were on the velt after living on trees,

72
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,550
we had to go down to the dam water holes
and you've.

73
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,360
You've watched enough nature programs to
know what a denial crocodile can do to a

74
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,040
water buffalo.
It's not pretty.

75
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,370
And so to go down to the water,
the chaotic water and the source of all 

76
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:50,950
life as well,
right,

77
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,520
is to risk an encounter with the 
terrible thing that lurks in the depths.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,520
And so we use that as a central metaphor
for,

79
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,820
for,
for mapping the sorts of things that 

80
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,461
happened,
happened to us in a much more abstract 

81
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:07,561
space.
And you know that because one of the 

82
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:08,350
things you're going to do,
let's say that the,

83
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,510
the,
the professor,

84
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,350
there's a professor obviously who gave 
you the bad grade,

85
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,100
okay?
So one logical presupposition is that 

86
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,570
you're in some sense insufficient in 
relationship to the course.

87
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,870
But another logical and instantaneous 
categorization is to throw that person 

88
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,250
into the category of malevolent 
Predator.

89
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,870
And you'll do that by becoming upset and
cursing the person in your imagination.
