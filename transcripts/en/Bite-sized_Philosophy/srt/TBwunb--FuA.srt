1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,160
I was thinking about the issue of 
discrimination in relationship to sex 

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,220
because I've been thinking a lot about 
discrimination lately because everybody 

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,071
thinks discrimination is a bad idea,
which is a very stupid proposition 

4
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:16,791
because you're discriminating all the 
time and the most fundamental form of 

5
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,630
discrimination is choice of sexual 
partner.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,480
And so you might say,
well why should that even be allowed?

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,510
Because it is the most fundamental form 
of discrimination.

8
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:29,511
So for example,
almost everyone is racially prejudice 

9
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:30,540
when it comes to sexual partners.
So you think,

10
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,050
well,
is that,

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:31,710
is that,
uh,

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,060
what about,
uh,

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,660
are you do use age as an exclusionary 
criteria?

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,670
Probably do use physical attractiveness 
only in so far as you're able,

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,860
right?
You use it completely.

16
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,870
If you could get away with it roughly 
speaking,

17
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:50,871
but you can't because the most 
attractive people aren't going to be 

18
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:50,871
anywhere near you.

19
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:52,020
So you can't do it.
But you'd like to.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,880
Health yes.
Strength.

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,930
Yes.
Wealth,

22
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:56,010
yes.
Education,

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,020
definitely.
So it's unbelievably discriminatory.

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,080
And so you might say,
well why is that justifiable?

25
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:05,790
And it seems to me that it's something 
like,

26
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,550
well,
you get to say no to me if I get to say 

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:13,550
no to you.
It's something like that.

28
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,930
We've agreed that everybody gets to 
discriminate on that basis and because 

29
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,970
everybody can do it then it's fair.
It's something like that.

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,090
It's very much we're thinking about,
you know,

31
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:29,091
I don't know if you know this,
but in Huxley's brave new world where 

32
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:32,781
the family had been completely 
demolished rate and children were 

33
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:36,000
conceived in bottles and given an 
produced in factories.

34
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:40,350
So the whole idea of the relationship 
between sex and procreation had become a

35
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:44,790
taboo.
One of the Mantras,

36
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:48,570
the slogans of the society was everyone 
belongs to everyone else.

37
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,140
And so it was actually a social full 
pause to refuse to sleep with someone 

38
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:58,620
just as it was a social for Paul to have
any exclusionary relationship.

39
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,070
Because another thing that you might 
notice is that there's nothing more 

40
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,170
discriminatory than falling in love with
someone.

41
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:09,150
It's like you're special and all the 
rest of you know.

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,670
So it's the ultimate exclusionary act.
Right?

43
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:14,040
And yet we presume that that's an 
acceptable,

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,220
not only acceptable.
We demand that as a,

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,320
as a right and well,
that's where thinking about a lot.
