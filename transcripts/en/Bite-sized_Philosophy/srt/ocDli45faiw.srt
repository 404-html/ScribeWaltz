1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,930
Um,
you know,

2
00:00:00,931 --> 00:00:04,170
you hear very frequently people say 
things like everyone's creative.

3
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,850
It's like that's wrong,
okay,

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,970
it's wrong.
It's just as wrong as saying that 

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:10,970
everyone's extroverted,
first of all,

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,781
you have to be pretty damn smart to be 
creative because otherwise you're just 

7
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,961
going to get to where other people have 
already got and that's not creative by 

8
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:17,961
definition.
So,

9
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,450
so being fast and being out there at the
front of things really makes a 

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,781
difference.
And then you also have to have these 

11
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:26,781
divergent thinking capabilities and 
that's part of your traits.

12
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:29,970
Structure and creative people are really
different than non creative people,

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,370
you know,
partly because for example,

14
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:37,371
they're highly motivated to do creative 
things and to experience novelty and to 

15
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,530
end to end,
to chase down aesthetic experiences into

16
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:44,400
a 10 movies and to read fiction and to 
go to museums and to enjoy poetry and,

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,900
and,
and to enjoy music that's not 

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:49,900
conventional music for example.

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,620
These aren't trivial differences.
And so and so it's a real,

20
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:56,460
it's a real misstatement to make the 
proposition that everyone's creative.

21
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,460
It's just simply not the case.
It's a matter of wishful thinking.

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,700
It's like saying that everyone's 
intelligent,

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,190
it's like,
well,

24
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:07,191
if everyone's intelligent than then the 
term loses all of its meaning because 

25
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:08,790
any term that you can apply to every 
member of a category,

26
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:12,460
it has absolutely no meaning.
Now that doesn't end.

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,540
You know?
The other thing you want to be thinking 

28
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:17,540
about here is that don't be thinking 
that creativity is such a good thing.

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,590
It's a high risk,
high return strategy,

30
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,930
so if you're creative,
you just try this.

31
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:23,460
There's creative people in this room,
man,

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,640
you guys are gonna.
Have a hell of a time monetizing your 

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:28,640
creativity.
It's virtually impossible.

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,450
It's really,
really difficult because first of all,

35
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:35,451
let's say you make an original product,
you think the world will beat a pathway 

36
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:35,451
to your door.

37
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:37,260
If you build a better mouse trap.
It's like that's complete rubbish.

38
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,780
It isn't.
It isn't true in the least.

39
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,140
If you make a good creative product,
you've probably solved about five 

40
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,041
percent of your problem because then you
have marketing which is insanely 

41
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:53,301
difficult and then you have sales and 
then you have customer support and then 

42
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:54,390
you have to build an organization and 
you have to.

43
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,570
If it's really novel,
you have to tell people what the hell 

44
00:01:59,570 --> 00:01:59,570
the thing is,
you know,

45
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,750
we built this future authoring program,
right,

46
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,470
and it's available for people online,
so how do you market that?

47
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,080
No one knows what that is and that's a 
real problem.

48
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:12,081
If you read a book while then you have 
the problem that another million people 

49
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:15,381
have also written a book,
but if you produce something that's 

50
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:15,381
completely new and doesn't have a 
category,

51
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:18,660
people can't search for it online,
how are they going to find it so you you

52
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:23,661
just have and then you have pricing 
problems and it's really unbelievably 

53
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:27,240
difficult to produce something creative 
and then monetize it and even worse,

54
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,330
if you're the creative person,
let's say you have a spectacular 

55
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:32,330
invention,
you've got no money,

56
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:32,330
right?

57
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,420
You've got no customers,
no,

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,110
those are big problems and so maybe you 
go and you find a venture capitalist.

59
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,330
We start with family and friends because
that's how it works.

60
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:44,331
He raised money for your product.
You raise money from your family and 

61
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,881
friends.
That's assuming you have family and 

62
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:47,760
friends that have some money and that 
they're going to give it to you and most

63
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:50,970
people aren't in that situation,
so it's a terrible barrier right off the

64
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:55,971
bat and then of course you're putting 
your family and friends at substantial 

65
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:57,870
financial risk because the probability 
that you're stupid idea is going to make

66
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:02,871
money is virtually zero even if it's a 
really brilliant idea and so then let's 

67
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:04,300
say,
well you get past family and friends and

68
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:09,301
you get venture capitalists,
capitalists involved because that's 

69
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:12,001
often the next step or an angel investor
that's there's steps in building a 

70
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:13,000
business,
family and friends,

71
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,320
Angel investor that some rich guy that 
you happened to meet some manner in some

72
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:17,740
way.

73
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Who's who's into this sort of thing is 
is willing to provide you with some 

74
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,110
money to get your product off the 
ground?

75
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,380
Well,
how much of your product is that person 

76
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:28,380
going to take?
Well,

77
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,040
most of it,
most of it,

78
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,280
and then if you get a venture and no 
wonder because you know you don't have 

79
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,220
any money,
how are you going to bargain for control

80
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:37,870
over your product?
He'll just say,

81
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,520
well,
do you want the money or not,

82
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,060
and if your answer is no,
then he'll go and do something else with

83
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:48,061
his money.
It's not like there's no shortage of 

84
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,420
things that you can do with your money.
There's a million things you can do with

85
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:54,421
it so you're not in a great bargaining 
position and then if you get venture 

86
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:55,300
capitalists involved,
they'll take another big chunk and maybe

87
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,990
if they're not very straight with you,
they'll just throw you out because maybe

88
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,760
by that point in the company's 
development,

89
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:03,550
you're nothing but a pain in the neck 
because what do you know about marketing

90
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,730
and sales and customer service and 
building an organization and running a 

91
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,450
business like you don't have a clue,
so why do they need you?

92
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,140
So even if you're a successful at 
generating a new idea and you put it 

93
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,611
into a business,
the probability that you as the 

94
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:22,210
originator of the idea are going to make
some money from it is very,

95
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:27,211
very low.
So don't be thinking that creativity is 

96
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:30,271
such a.
is such a something you would want to 

97
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:30,271
curse yourself with.
Now,

98
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:35,030
you know,
it's not all bad because it opens up 

99
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,530
avenues of experience for creative 
people that aren't available to people 

100
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,440
who aren't creative,
but it definitely is a high risk,

101
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:40,390
high return strategy,
you know,

102
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,510
so the overwhelming probability is that 
you will fail,

103
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,940
but a small proportion of creative 
people succeed spectacularly.

104
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,610
And so it's like a lottery in some 
sense.

105
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,890
You're probably gonna lose,
but if you don't lose,

106
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:56,920
you could win big and that keeps a lot 
of creative people going.

107
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,100
But also they don't really have much 
choice in it because if you're a 

108
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,010
creative person,
you're like to have a fruit tree that's,

109
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,170
that's bearing fruit so you don't really
have,

110
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,480
you can suppress it,
but it's very bad for,

111
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:12,481
you know,
the creative people I've worked with as 

112
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:13,210
if they're not creative,
they're miserable so they have to do it.

113
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,950
But,
and,

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,400
and you know,
there's real joy and pleasure in it and,

115
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,130
and,
and,

116
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,090
and,
and,

117
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,220
and psychological utility.
But that doesn't necessarily mean that 

118
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,901
it's an intelligent,
it's certainly not a conservative 

119
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:27,901
strategy for moving forward through 
life.

120
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,410
So,
and you know,

121
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:34,411
whenever I talk to people who are 
creative and you guys should listen to 

122
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:34,411
this because I know what I'm talking 
about,

123
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:39,180
if you happen to be creative,
if you're a songwriter or another kind 

124
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,571
of musician or an artist or or or any of
the other number of things that you 

125
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:46,411
might be,
find a way to make money and then 

126
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:49,960
practice your craft on the side because 
you will starve to death otherwise.

127
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,030
Now some for some of you that will be 
true,

128
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:57,031
but it's a tiny minority.
You're best bet is to find a job that 

129
00:05:57,031 --> 00:06:00,151
will keep body and soul together and 
parse off some time that you can pursue 

130
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,170
your creative thing because then,
well as a longterm strategy,

131
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,150
medium to longterm strategy,
it's a better one.

132
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,490
But it's got incredibly difficult for 
people.

133
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,660
Musicians,
for example.

134
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:13,661
It's incredibly difficult for new 
musicians to monetize their craft even 

135
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:14,690
if they're really,
really good at it.

136
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,790
So it's,
it's,

137
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,550
well,
so anyway,

138
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:19,010
so don't be.
So I say,

139
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:19,850
well,
everyone's not.

140
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,680
Everyone's not creative.
And everybody goes,

141
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,520
oh,
that's terrible.

142
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:23,750
It's like,
it's not so terrible.

143
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,960
It's not something.
It's not self evident that you would 

144
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:28,960
curse someone with high levels of 
creativity.
