1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,030
Oh,
the fine arts programs now in in I think

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,540
pretty much almost 100 percent are based
on contemporary art practices and so 

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,110
very few universities,
very few programs teach technical skills

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:18,111
or teach you how to draw in a in a 
classical way so they actually not 

5
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:22,370
really teaching anything.
It's hard to know exactly what they're 

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:22,370
doing,

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,080
I guess it was ever since the 19 sixties
through speeding this idea in the art 

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,191
world that technical skills and ability 
just aren't that important and that the 

9
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:32,960
important thing is to find your,
I would say your political voice,

10
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:37,910
but it's very strange to me that this 
has occurred because it seems to me that

11
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,020
before your voice is anything but a an 
off color croak,

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,800
you have to become a disciple of a 
discipline and an apprenticeship and and

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,100
learn the tools and trades of your craft
and learn how to be an artist because 

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,920
there's a technical end to that.

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,580
I mean,
this is really almost an image of the 

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:00,580
world as it stands now.
The,

17
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,760
the,
the purpose or the stated purpose of,

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,950
of,
of modern officially postmodern art was 

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:06,950
to free the artists,
right to break,

20
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,500
to break away all the things that were 
holding the artist back in terms of 

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,130
rules and in terms of,
of uh,

22
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,290
just the way things were presented,
but when ended up happening is that 

23
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,200
there were no more legitimate 
legitimizing objective or you know,

24
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,300
strong legitimising structures around 
the art.

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,100
The only thing left was politics and 
relationships and status basically.

26
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:28,840
So our funders,

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,310
there's a big literature on creativity 
and it's strongly,

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,850
which I know very well.
My lab designed the creative achievement

29
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:40,851
questionnaire which is used.
It's been used in hundreds of studies 

30
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,791
now to assess lifetime creativity.
And so I've spent a lot of time looking 

31
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,290
at the measurement of creativity and 
also trying to understand creativity.

32
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:51,291
And the literature strongly suggest that
when you impose restrictions on people,

33
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,360
it actually makes them more creative 
rather than less.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,110
Because part of what creativity is the 
overcoming of obstacles.

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,440
You know,
imagine someone who writes poetry and 

36
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:03,520
the Haiku format.
Well,

37
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,320
it's,
it's very,

38
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:07,170
very restrictive and obviously 
arbitrarily sold.

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,560
But the fact of the restriction is 
partly what makes the poetic form 

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,020
possible.
The same thing is true.

41
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:15,620
If you think about playing a game,
there's a.

42
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,780
there's far more things that you can't 
do when you play chess than there are 

43
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,161
things that you can do,
but there's still an infinite number of 

44
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:28,581
variations of chess games.
So this idea that there's a dichotomy 

45
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,930
between structure and rules and 
creativity is,

46
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,010
is pernicious Lee false and contradicted
by the evidence.

47
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,120
And when you,
when you started to explore the art 

48
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,120
world,
and the way it works is there's an irony

49
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,381
there that it purports to not have 
boundaries on creativity and 

50
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:48,271
instructions on care team,
but they're actually extremely strict 

51
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:48,271
and they're hidden.
They're,

52
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:51,920
they're kind of this pernicious thing 
underneath where we're actually you.

53
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,480
You have to present things in a very,
very precise way for it to be able to,

54
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,570
to enter into the legitimizing structure
of the,

55
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:00,290
of the gallery.
