1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,930
Okay,
so the question is that the totalitarian

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:08,010
forms that we've seen primarily in the 
past have been male and,

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,260
but maybe we're seeing something 
different now.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,670
I really don't think it's different.
I think it's.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,630
It's out of the common kind that's 
expanded in its dominion,

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,170
so you imagine that there's an essential
feminine pathology just as there is an 

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,080
essential masculine pathology and the 
essential feminine pathology.

8
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:33,081
Freud mapped out.
It's the eternal mother and the mother 

9
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:35,100
is the mother that gets too close to her
children.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,800
Right,
and intermingles herself with them too,

11
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:41,400
too great.
A degree that in her attempts to protect

12
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:46,401
them undermines them fatally,
and so there's a classic representation 

13
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:52,071
of the feminine in the West and the 
classic representation is married and 

14
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:53,190
here,
here's one of the representations.

15
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:58,191
It's lovely and it's derived at least in
part from the story of Mary and the 

16
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:02,991
snake in the garden of Eden,
and so Mary has her foot on a serpent 

17
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:05,280
and she's holding Christ off to the side
like this.

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,850
Well,
that's exactly what mothers have always 

19
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,501
done.
It's a biological portrait of human 

20
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:15,651
women is they hold their infants out of 
the reach of the terrible Serpentine 

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,140
Predator.
Obviously that's what we do.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,490
Well,
that's fine,

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,940
but adults aren't infants and neither 
are children and if you treat them like 

24
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,560
they are,
you undermine them,

25
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:29,820
you,
you,

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,220
you,
you pathologize them,

27
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:37,221
you turn them into old infants.
That's an ugly thing and that's the 

28
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:38,850
Freudian nightmare.
You know,

29
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,320
in,
in this happens in therapy very 

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,701
frequently.
I mean you can be tangled into a 

31
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,771
terrible relationship with your father 
that's often either because he was 

32
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:52,380
absent or abusive or tyrannical,
something like that,

33
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,330
but that standard pathology with mom is,
she did everything for you.

34
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,230
Well,
what's left for you to do nothing 

35
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,230
including never leaving.

36
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,940
Right?
And that's the motivation.

37
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,030
You know,
for the woman who's nothing but 

38
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,280
protective mother,
there's no role outside of nurturing,

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,980
of nurturing,
nurturing,

40
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,630
of nurturance,
of infants,

41
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:22,890
of nurture,
of infants.

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,060
Well,
you just keep them.

43
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,710
Infants,
they'll never leave.

44
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,540
Am I kill you in night in your sleep?
But they'll never leave.

45
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,260
Sure,
sure.

46
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:39,261
I mean,
it's so comical watching the feminist 

47
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:42,260
postmodernists in particular rattle on 
about the absence of gender reality and 

48
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:47,781
act out the archetipal devouring mother 
at exactly the same time for them,

49
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,370
for them.
The world is divided into predators and 

50
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,001
infants and the predators are evil and 
need to be stopped and the infants need 

51
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:01,840
to be cared for.
Well,

52
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:06,400
that's what the mother does,
but adults are not infants

53
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,430
and all you do is destroy them when you 
treat them that way,

54
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:13,130
especially when they're adolescents and 
just starting to develop.

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,020
Now there's.
There's a rule that I attempted to abide

56
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,030
by when I had small children and the 
rule was don't do anything for your 

57
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,750
children that they can do themselves and
it's annoying that rule because it takes

58
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,770
you like 15 seconds to to dress a two 
year old,

59
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:32,690
but you'll let that two year old dress 
himself.

60
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:37,110
It's like 15 minutes or 20 minutes or 
half an hour.

61
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:42,130
You chase them around the house,
but if you let them learn to dress 

62
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,521
themselves,
then you don't have to dress themselves 

63
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:45,521
any direct,
dress them anymore and they can do it,

64
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:47,570
and you do that with setting the table 
and you do that with everything.

65
00:03:47,571 --> 00:03:48,290
It's like,
no,

66
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:53,291
it's okay.
You do that now while I care for you so 

67
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:53,291
much.
Let me do that for you.

68
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:57,041
It's like,
I don't care for you at all when I say 

69
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,691
that I don't care for you at all.
I'm going to stop doing everything I 

70
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:00,920
possibly can for you as rapidly as I 
possibly can say,

71
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:01,580
well,
that's great.

72
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:03,140
That's how you work in an old age home.

73
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,940
Do not do anything for the inhabitants 
that they can do themselves because you 

74
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,210
robbed them of the last vestiges of 
their independence.

75
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,130
Right?
It's what you do when you're a manager.

76
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:18,131
If you're a good manager,
you make yourself superfluous by 

77
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:22,480
extending autonomy and independence to 
the people that you manage so that they 

78
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,871
can take over the whole job.
You don't do that by doing everything 

79
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:29,471
for people and you certainly don't do 
that by dividing the world 

80
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:31,460
architecturally and uncritically into 
predators.

81
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,240
Those who have more and victims,
infants,

82
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,200
those who have nothing and acting like 
all you can ever do is protect them.

83
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,760
You don't protect,
first of all,

84
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:43,160
you can't protect people.
You can only make them strong.

85
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,500
That's it.
You cannot protect them.

86
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,740
You can make them strong and then they 
can predict themselves,

87
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,620
but then they don't need you.
Right,

88
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,920
and there's the underground pathological
element of the devouring mother.

89
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,120
It's like,
never leave me.

90
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:58,250
Here's the deal.
I'll do everything for you.

91
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,220
You just never leave.
Right.

92
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,950
That's sleeping with your mother,
right?

93
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:05,580
That's the Friday a nightmare,
right?

94
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
You don't invite your child into your 
bed,

95
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,220
right.
You distinguished between them and you.

96
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,250
You distinguish between them and your 
husband and you facilitate their 

97
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,321
independence.
A part of the reason why it's useful to 

98
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:23,561
have a mother and a father is because 
the mother has to fall insanely in love 

99
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:24,410
with the infant or she'd throw it out 
the window,

100
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,440
right?
Because they're.

101
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,370
They're insanely demanding and they're 
always right.

102
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,970
Right.
Because the right way to treat an 

103
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:33,970
infant,
especially before nine months,

104
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,120
is I'll do everything for you and you're
always right in your needs.

105
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,180
Take priority over everyone's one else's
and anybody that threatens you is 

106
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,370
terrible.
Exactly right,

107
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,300
but after once the kid is ambulatory and
starting to be independent,

108
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,530
that's the wrong attitude.

109
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,130
The attitude then is no get the hell on 
with it.

110
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,460
And men who are less prone to negative 
emotion and less compassionate are much 

111
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,310
better at fostering kind of 
independence.

112
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,460
And so it's usually then when they step 
into the family and start playing with 

113
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,230
the kids rough and tumble play and 
pushing them forward and saying,

114
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:07,550
you know,
get on with it.

115
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,680
You can do it,
you can do it at home.

116
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,700
It's very hard for a mother to play both
those rules because she has to fall so 

117
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,041
in love with her infant that it's 
difficult for her to be universal 

118
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:18,890
caregiver and disciplinarian at the same
time,

119
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,110
you know,
because the roles are the roles run 

120
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,081
contrary to one another.
So now women have entered the political 

121
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:28,511
sphere right on Mohs,
and so they're going to bring their 

122
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:29,210
essential nature with them all the while
saying,

123
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,430
there's no such thing as essential 
nature.

124
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:32,180
It's like,
yeah,

125
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,840
there is.
