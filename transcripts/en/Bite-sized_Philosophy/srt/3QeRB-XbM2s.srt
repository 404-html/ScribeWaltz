1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,290
Elegance is an interesting concept.
It's very controversial.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,450
In fact,
if you,

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,090
one of the things that continually 
happens over and over again in 

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,791
psychology is that psychologists 
discover all sorts of new kinds of 

5
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:20,001
intelligence and you know,
the biggest two proponents of that sort 

6
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:24,741
of thing.
I suppose we're Bob Sternberg who came 

7
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:24,741
up with this thing equaled practical 
intelligence.

8
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:29,181
And then Howard Gardner who came up with
the theory of multiple intelligences 

9
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:31,560
which had a very large effect on 
educational psychology,

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,500
um,
when the theory was first proposed.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,900
And that's not saying much because 
generally speaking,

12
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:41,901
it's very difficult to find a discipline
that's more susceptible to fads than 

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,180
educational psychology.
And as far as I can tell,

14
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:48,300
generally speaking,
each fat is worse than the previous one.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,220
So,
you know,

16
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:53,850
Gardner positive that I think there were
seven.

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,600
Oh,
there they are,

18
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:58,530
seven or eight different intelligence,
linguistic,

19
00:00:58,531 --> 00:00:59,670
musical,
logical,

20
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:01,800
mathematical,
spacial body,

21
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:05,400
kinesthetic,
intrapersonal and interpersonal.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,760
And people talk about emotional 
intelligence and they talk about 

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,670
practical intelligence.
And as far as I'm concerned,

24
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:16,050
all of that is complete rubbish.
And there's technical reasons for that.

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,230
I mean there's technical and 
philosophical reasons for that.

26
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,680
The first thing is you can't just mess 
up a word,

27
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,130
you know,
the whole point of having a word is so 

28
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,321
that it defined some things that 
described some things and doesn't 

29
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:30,321
describe other things.
Right,

30
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:35,000
and so you can.
You can make the word intelligence a 

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,610
current for whatever you want,
so you can say that the ability to dance

32
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:43,611
as a form of intelligence,
but the problem with that is you blur 

33
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:45,990
out the word so badly.
You can't tell what it means anymore.

34
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,470
And so,
and I would also point out we had 

35
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,421
perfectly good words for those major 
intelligence as we called them talents 

36
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:58,070
and so it's perfectly reasonable to make
a distinction between the talent and 

37
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,350
intelligence.

38
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,490
Now you might say,
well,

39
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:04,491
how the hell do you know the difference?
Like if if things look similar to some 

40
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,540
degree,
then how do you know if they're the same

41
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,440
or different?
Well,

42
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:10,650
that's exactly what you do when you do 
the construct validity process.

43
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:15,651
So let's say you rated a number of 
people on their dancing ability and then

44
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:20,010
you rated the number of people on their 
ability to multiply two digit,

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,240
two,
two digit numbers in their head quickly 

46
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,700
while then you see,
technically if both of those were 

47
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,331
intelligences,
then the people who could dance better 

48
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:35,421
could multiply two digit numbers faster 
in their head and that they would be 

49
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:40,491
slightly positive story.
See,

50
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:44,010
that's what happens when I don't have 
any diet coke.

51
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,740
So anyways,
if intelligence was the right word to 

52
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,671
subsume both of those,
then what you see is that would be a 

53
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:59,811
high correlation that people who are 
good dancers would also be the ones who 

54
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:02,991
could multiply most rapidly.
And I mean multiply in their head,

55
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,060
um,
but that,

56
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,720
but you're not going to be able to 
extract out a single factor like that.

57
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,480
It's just not,
it's just not the case that those things

58
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:18,481
associate like that.
So for something to be one phenomena,

59
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:27,490
the things that it.
Obviously I've talked too much this 

60
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:34,871
semester,
all the things that are subsumed under 

61
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:40,371
that definition have to be correlated 
and highly correlated because otherwise 

62
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,070
they're not the same thing.
It's the definition of the same thing.

63
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,900
Now,
Iq is a very peculiar construct,

64
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,850
a very unique construct from a 
psychological perspective,

65
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,880
but also more generally from a social 
science perspective because Iq has the 

66
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:04,521
most predictive validity of anything 
ever discovered in the social sciences 

67
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:04,950
period.
