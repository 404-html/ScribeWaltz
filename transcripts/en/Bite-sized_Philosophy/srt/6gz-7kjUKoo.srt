1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,700
It's the beginning of the lecture,
but how do,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,290
how does morality from

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,710
stronger and weaker to what's good and 
what is it?

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,160
Well,
I think it depends to some degree on 

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,201
what you mean by stronger.
So physical strength is one element and 

6
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:23,631
like if you look at mythological heroes,
imagine that the stories of heroes are 

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,970
fragmented elements of,
uh,

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,060
of the archetype.
And so one kind of archetypal hero 

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,670
obviously as someone who's physically 
strong,

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,170
you know,
you see that there's a great movie that 

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:39,170
you could watch about this.
It's called Hitman Hart.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,280
It's one of the best documentaries I've 
ever seen and it's about this guy named 

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,040
Bret Harte.
Bret Harte was for awhile,

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,160
the most famous Canadian on the planet,
and he was a worldwide wrestling 

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,280
foundation,
I think.

16
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:52,780
What did they call that?
Wwf?

17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,940
Yeah,
he was there,

18
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:58,470
like lead good guy.
And so he and wrestling,

19
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,390
I love the documentary because when I 
was a little kid,

20
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:06,391
like four or five,
I used to watch his father whose name 

21
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:07,540
was Stu Hart,
who ran this channel,

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,090
this wrestling confederation in Alberta.

23
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,210
And Stu Hart had I think eight boys and 
he trained all of them to be pro 

24
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,681
wrestlers and part of the movie is 
extraordinarily funny because Stu Hart 

25
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,540
is in it and he's really old.
He's like 85 and he's just barely.

26
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,240
Can you imagine?
He was like a pro wrestler for 40 years,

27
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:30,241
like every joint is broken and he still 
big but he's just barely moving and this

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,160
is this kid and another kid come over 
and I'm.

29
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,660
Stu is telling the story about how it 
used to take his boys into the basement 

30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,131
and toughen them up.
And I think Brett called that the 

31
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:47,101
journey to pain or something like that.
His father would take all these kids 

32
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:50,431
down there and wrestle with them and 
push them right to the edge of their 

33
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:50,830
pain tolerance constantly.
And so.

34
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,330
And anyways,
they grew up tough.

35
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:53,500
There's no doubt about that.

36
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,770
And all his daughters married pro 
wrestlers to.

37
00:01:56,771 --> 00:02:00,790
And I think he had seven daughters.
So he's quite the character anyways.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,580
These two kids,
they're like their late adolescence,

39
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:08,581
early adulthood come over and one of 
them's pretty damn cocky and he's 

40
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:10,090
listening to Stewart.
He says something smart like,

41
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:10,660
well,
you know,

42
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:12,820
you were pretty,
you were pretty tough with the old days.

43
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:14,590
Hey,
and stew looks at them and says,

44
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:14,900
well,
why?

45
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,820
Why don't you come down to the basement 
with me?

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,490
And he says,
look,

47
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:20,330
I don't want to hurt you old man.
And so,

48
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,370
so they're filmmakers follow them into 
the basement day and like they're kind 

49
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,350
of standing there and the old guy grabs 
him in a headlock.

50
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:31,060
It takes him like,
he's like a snake,

51
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:36,061
a,
he's got her in a headlock like so fast 

52
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:36,061
that the kid doesn't know what to do.
And then.

53
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,260
So stew,
like,

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,890
who knows how to put a headlock on 
someone.

55
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,960
He's flexing his,
his uh,

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,200
his uh,
his,

57
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,450
his forearm.
Yeah.

58
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:48,451
Which is still not so bad.
A forearm and he's got this guy's face 

59
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,030
is just,
he's just,

60
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,920
he's like,
he's stepped in a bear trap.

61
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,130
Plus he's absolutely shocked that this 
old guy got him.

62
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,790
And so he's kind of gasping and stu says
something like,

63
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,740
you watch,
if I flex this just right,

64
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:02,620
and you can see this vein on his 
forehead start to pop out.

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,510
It's extraordinarily funny.
Anyways,

66
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,150
Bret Hart plays out the good guy 
archetype and Brett's like,

67
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,750
he's a solid guy,
but he's,

68
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,920
I would say he's not particularly 
sophisticated and I'm not being cruel 

69
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,581
about that.
I mean he had a great career and he's 

70
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:21,370
tough as a boot and so good for him,
but he plays out this,

71
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,940
this good guy archetype and he gets 
tangled up in it.

72
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,700
And now I don't remember your damn 
question,

73
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:30,400
but I am trying to answer it.
Tell me the question again.

74
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,660
Oh yes,
yes.

75
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:38,440
Okay.
Exactly.

76
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:43,441
Well,
so one of the things I really liked 

77
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:43,990
about this movie was it showed me why 
people watched wrestling and I couldn't,

78
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,100
I couldn't because certainly they're not
appealing and I'm not being.

79
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,150
There are different strata of conception
of abstraction that any entertainment 

80
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,820
process has to appeal to.
And you know,

81
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:02,821
most people don't go to movies and 
that's actually because it really is 

82
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:04,970
because movies operate at a level of 
sophistication that are too high,

83
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,750
that is too high for many people just 
like novels.

84
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:10,150
I mean hardly anyone reads,
you know,

85
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:15,151
and if you about 15 percent of the 
population might be 20 percent cannot 

86
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:18,400
read well enough to follow written 
instructions and so and,

87
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,510
and they and people who are,
maybe it's 15 percent of the population 

88
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,550
or 10 percent have never finished a 
book,

89
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,170
never.
And so,

90
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,150
and it is that high,
but,

91
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,460
but you still,
you're still,

92
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,580
the archetypes still needs to manifest 
itself at different levels and so it 

93
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,031
manifests itself in wrestling,
but even there where it is physical 

94
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:39,640
force,
it's not just physical force,

95
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,820
like it's a drama between good and evil 
and you can see this so clearly and in 

96
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,010
the Bret Hart documentary,
because he's the good guy and you know,

97
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,450
the bad guys are really over the top 
bad.

98
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,450
It's a real drama.
It's like it's good versus evil in the 

99
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,481
rain every time.
And hopefully good winds but good often 

100
00:04:57,481 --> 00:04:57,481
gets,
you know,

101
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:01,761
maybe the bad wrestler brings two of his
friends in and they bring in chairs and 

102
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:02,080
they bashed the hell out of the good 
guy.

103
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:04,780
And the whole audience is just outraged 
by this.

104
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:08,350
And and the documentary does a lovely 
job of showing that,

105
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,650
but so even at the level of physical 
combat,

106
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:16,651
let's say you can't reduce what's good 
to what strong is just one element of it

107
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,230
better to be strong than to be weak and 
so you can have a strong hero because 

108
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,800
it's better to be strong than to be 
weak,

109
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,100
but it's better to be strong and kind 
than to be strong and it's better to be 

110
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,020
strong and kind and wise than to be 
strong and kind and so.

111
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,530
And that's true not only for human 
beings but it's even true,

112
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:40,531
let's say at the wolf for the chimpanzee
level because one of the things you see 

113
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:43,570
with the chimp dominance hierarchies if,
and I think I mentioned this before,

114
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:48,571
is if the leader,
the dominant male is really good at 

115
00:05:48,571 --> 00:05:52,890
fostering social relations and being 
reciprocal in acts like grooming and 

116
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,030
also paying attention to the females and
their offspring.

117
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,420
His dynasty will be much more stable and
so strong might be good for one battle.

118
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,960
It might be good for two battles,
but for 50 battles it's not optimized.

119
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,230
Especially because no law,
no matter how strong you are,

120
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,160
someone can take you out,
so,

121
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,510
so what happens is the idea of what's 
ideal becomes increasingly complex 

122
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,130
across time,
multifaceted,

123
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,140
right,
and so strength,

124
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:22,310
wisdom,
intelligence,

125
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:27,311
vision,
all these things are amalgamated into a 

126
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:29,240
single ba and we'll talk a lot about 
that because I want to show you how that

127
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:34,241
happened in Mesopotamia because that's 
one of the first places where we have 

128
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:34,970
documentation about how that ideally 
merged.

129
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,130
They have a god called Marduk and Martin
had 50 names and as far as I can tell,

130
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:45,131
the reason for that was that mark was an
amalgam of the tribal Dante's of at 

131
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:49,481
least 50 tribes and and when the within 
tribes were brought together and 

132
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:53,891
civilized,
each of their gods who were ideals had 

133
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:55,010
to be amalgamated into something that 
was a single,

134
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,480
a single dramatized representation of 
value.

135
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:02,330
Or there was no way that all those 
people could have lived together.

136
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,390
Right?
There are different value structures 

137
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:07,390
would have fragmented them and they 
would have stayed in a state of war.

138
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,060
And so the question is,
what's the question you're asking?

139
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,740
If it's not strength than what is it?
Well,

140
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:18,741
it's strength is an element,
but the Egyptians figured out that it 

141
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:22,391
was.
Vision is actually the capacity to pay 

142
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:23,750
attention.
That was paramount and the Mesopotamians

143
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:25,760
have that figured out more or less too,
because they're god.

144
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:27,650
Marduk had eyes all the way around his 
head.

145
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,510
He could see everywhere.
So seeing was a critical element of what

146
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:37,511
should be on top.
And the other thing for the 

147
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:39,320
Mesopotamians was the ability to speak.
So by the time of Mesopotamia,

148
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:44,300
people that already dramatized the idea
