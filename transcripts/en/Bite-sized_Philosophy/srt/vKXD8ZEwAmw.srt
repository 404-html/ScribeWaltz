1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,980
So the question was positive emotions 
mediated by dopamine.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,590
When you're advancing toward something,
say,

3
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:09,050
or when you have a cue that something 
good is about to happen,

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,700
what is the system that mediates 
positive emotion at the satiation level?

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,100
Negative.
Negative.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:19,930
Yup.

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,530
Okay.
Okay.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,260
Well,
let's start with the satiation issue.

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,930
That seems most deregulated by 
Serotonin.

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,130
The opiate issue is there are other 
forms of specific reward that don't seem

11
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:36,890
to be merely motivated or merely 
underpinned by dopamine,

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,050
and the opiate system would be one of 
those.

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,230
There's an oxytocin system as well,
so there are other biochemical systems 

14
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,840
that are involved in more specific forms
of reward,

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,200
but the thing that's common among 
instances that make it appear that 

16
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,420
you're moving forward is the 
dopaminergic element,

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,750
roughly speaking,
and then one of the things that happens 

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,160
if you're higher in Serotonin because 
you're more dominant,

19
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:07,080
is that you're more satiated all the 
time.

20
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,620
That's why people who are low in the 
dominance hierarchy with decreased 

21
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,131
levels of Serotonin are more impulsive 
and also more emotionally dysregulated.

22
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:18,960
They're more impulsive because,
hey,

23
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:20,850
you take your positive thing when you 
can get it,

24
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,700
and so they're.
They're more dissatisfied,

25
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:28,630
they're more looking for anything that 
will produce a positive outcome,

26
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,190
and then they're also more likely to 
experience negative emotion,

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,720
partly because their serotonin systems 
are lower,

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,470
indicating their tenuous status in the 
dominance hierarchy,

29
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,150
meaning that everything they do that's 
uncertain is far more dangerous.

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,960
So this is also why it's very difficult 
often when you're trying to treat 

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,651
someone who's depressed because you 
could say there's not much difference 

32
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:58,610
between being depressed and existing in 
the biochemical state.

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,520
That being at the bottom of the 
dominance hierarchy would produce.

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,270
In fact they're the same thing.
Well then the question is,

35
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:10,271
are you depressed or are you just at the
bottom of a dominance hierarchy because 

36
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:14,960
those are not like the symptomatology is
very,

37
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:19,961
very similar,
but the cause and the cure are not the 

38
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:23,300
same because you might be at the bottom 
of a dominant Turkey because you just.

39
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,510
Everything about your life is ruined.
So,

40
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,590
and of course your suffering.
Are you depressed,

41
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,090
sir?
No,

42
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,090
not exactly.
You just have nowhere to go.
