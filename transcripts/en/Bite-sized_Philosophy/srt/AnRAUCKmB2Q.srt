1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,280
And men are pretty good at taking care 
of children,

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:02,900
you know,
they're,

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,940
I would say they're not as good at 
taking care of infants as women are 

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,170
because they don't have the full range 
of resources at hand and they're not.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,430
I don't think they're they.
I don't think they have the same kind of

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,910
immediate intuitive understanding of or 
attraction to babies that men have.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,820
I think that switches around the age of 
two or two and a half when the kids can 

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,771
engage in rough and tumble play because 
men are much more likely to engage in 

9
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:34,911
rough and tumble play with children than
women are and rough and tumble play 

10
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:36,660
seems to be one of the things that 
symbolizes children.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,290
And it's partly because you know,
one of the things that you have to learn

12
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:45,291
when you're a child is what actually 
hurts you and what can be ignored and 

13
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,880
what actually hurts someone else and 
what can be ignored.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,070
And the best way to learn that is in 
rough and tumble play.

15
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:53,100
Because what happens is that if you 
playing with a kid,

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,930
they get more and more excited than they
do.

17
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:58,120
More and more crazy things until they do
something that either hurts them or,

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,120
or hurts you and then you have to say,
look,

19
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:00,440
you know,
that's,

20
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,000
you can't do that.
And,

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,110
and it's,
it's like a dance in a sense,

22
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:09,111
you know,
when you're wrestling with a little kid 

23
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:09,660
and you have to let them win fairly 
frequently because otherwise they don't.

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,050
They don't continue the game and you can
tell that because if they're,

25
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:18,230
if the game is going well,
they're laughing with insane delight 

26
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,080
because kids just love rough and tumble 
play,

27
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:19,910
you know,
and,

28
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,440
and they love crazy things.
I mean you can throw them in the air and

29
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,270
catch them and they think that's just 
great,

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:24,700
you know,
and,

31
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,990
but partly what you're doing is you're 
extending their body in all sorts of 

32
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,040
ways and getting them to learn in an 
embodied sense where the limits of that,

33
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,790
where their limits are and where the 
limits of other people are.

34
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,640
And that's embodied.
And children who haven't had that man,

35
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,800
they're just so awkward.
It's unbelievable.

36
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,150
You know,
they might have some hypothetical sense 

37
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,130
of how to interact with another person,
but they don't have an embodied sense of

38
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:52,131
it and they can't tell the difference 
between what hurts them and what 

39
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:52,131
doesn't,
you know,

40
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:52,780
because often at a young child,
if,

41
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,890
if they're startled,
they'll start to cry and then you can 

42
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:57,890
say,
well,

43
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:57,890
you know,
that didn't hurt.

44
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,290
And then they'll notice,
oh yeah,

45
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,820
that didn't hurt and they'll stop 
crying.

46
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,000
But if they haven't had their limits 
tested,

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,050
they'll cry at anything unexpected even 
if it doesn't hurt.

48
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:10,920
And that's not good because if you cry 
under all conditions,

49
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:15,921
the probability that you'll make friends
when you're three is like zero because 

50
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:16,950
another kid will start playing with you 
and maybe play rough.

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,230
And if you burst into terrorists,
you know,

52
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:21,960
several times the person,
the kids just going to go somewhere else

53
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:23,580
and find a different playmate.
You know,

54
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,960
they'll say you're just a baby.
