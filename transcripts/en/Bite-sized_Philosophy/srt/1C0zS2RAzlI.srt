1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,920
Iq is a very good predictor of health.
It's a predictor of longevity.

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:08,130
It's a predictor of resistance to 
posttraumatic stress disorder.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,880
It's a predictor of obviously 
occupational status.

4
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:16,140
It's a predictor of educational success.
That's a predictor of income.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,860
It's very powerful predictive,
and here's another way of 

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,170
conceptualizing its effect,
so imagine that you could choose how you

7
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:32,541
were going to be when you were born,
and this is in North America because 

8
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,510
it's going to vary by society at least 
to some degree.

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,230
You get to be born into a family that's 
at the 95th percentile for wealth or you

10
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:44,661
get to be born at the 95th percentile 
for intelligence who's better off at the

11
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:50,031
age of 40,
and the answer is the person who picks 

12
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:52,770
being born with an Iq in the 95th 
percentile at birth,

13
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,260
it's more powerful predictor of longterm
life outcome.

14
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:57,840
Then familiar wealth so

15
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:05,470
and it shows up everywhere.
Like one of the things we did recently 

16
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,831
was looking at disgust sensitivity.
We're going to talk a little bit about 

17
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:10,370
that when we talk about 
conscientiousness because orderly people

18
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:13,640
seem to be more sensitive to discuss the
disorderly people.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That seems to be why they're orderly,
but the higher you are in Icu,

20
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:23,750
the less disgust sensitive you are.
Now we don't know exactly why that is.

21
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:28,751
Maybe it's because you know,
maybe you could make the inference that 

22
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:33,011
Iq is,
is interrelated in some way to the 

23
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:35,030
physiological integrity of the cortex.
You know,

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,060
rather than the limbic system which you 
know is the source of say emotions and 

25
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,291
motivations and the more powerful it is,
the more inhibitory capacity it has over

26
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,930
the more fundamental motivations and 
emotions you could make.

27
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:52,670
That case.
Problem is,

28
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:57,671
is that intelligent people don't 
necessarily seem to be any less 

29
00:01:57,671 --> 00:02:01,811
impulsive.
So and you can have a pretty vicious 

30
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:06,971
personality disorder that's 
characterized by extremely disorganized 

31
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:10,331
behavior and a complete inability to put
longterm plans into operation and still 

32
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:15,131
have a high Iq.
So what are the things we really can't 

33
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:19,541
figure out?
It's just a hell of a thing to try to 

34
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:22,220
figure out is like the relationship 
between Iq and industriousness is zero

35
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,770
and that just makes no sense to me 
because most of the brain models are 

36
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,881
predicated on the idea that your ability
to engage in longterm planning is a 

37
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,680
factor that's associated with 
intelligence.

38
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,480
But then industrious people seem to not 
only engage in longterm planning,

39
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:43,120
they seem to do it right.
So then if they're more industrious,

40
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,030
they put their plans into operation,
then the plan is actually work,

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,740
but it's not correlated with our queue.
So then I can't figure out,

42
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:55,741
well obviously the industrious person in
some way is able to regulate their own 

43
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,880
behavior.
They're not procrastinating,

44
00:02:57,881 --> 00:03:01,210
for example.
And you'd think that that the ability to

45
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:04,750
not procrastinate would be a cognitive 
feature,

46
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,751
but it doesn't seem to be.
And we have no idea what makes people 

47
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:12,721
industrious and we can't figure it out.
So it's this incredibly potent 

48
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:16,411
predictors just about as powerful as ICU
and we have no idea what it is.

49
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,350
So.
So if you,

50
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,160
you know,
if you think,

51
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,890
if you have a smart idea about that and 
you want to pursue it,

52
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:27,010
like feel free because there's a big 
mystery there that no one's been able to

53
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:31,870
crack and we'd been at it for a long 
time and have had almost no success.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,920
You know,
we had people do things like give them 

55
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,301
sentences of ends,
ams and use sort of randomly distributed

56
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:41,050
and then we'd have them count the use,
you know,

57
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:44,350
like a whole page of sentences.
They're not sentences.

58
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:47,680
So just strings of letter count the use 
how useless,

59
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:52,681
you know,
you'd think that someone industrious 

60
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:52,681
would do that better.
It's like they don't.

61
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,720
That's an Iq test.
The people who can count the use faster 

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,590
have hierarchy cues.
Almost everything that you would do that

63
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:04,591
would wear it has to do with 
manipulation of abstractions of any 

64
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:04,780
sort.

65
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,650
Even something that basic seems to be 
fundamentally associated with Iq.

66
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,250
People with higher iqs have slightly 
bigger heads.

67
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,610
If you control for body size,
they have slightly bigger brains.

68
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,700
If you control for body size,
the axons on their neurons are a bit 

69
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,901
thicker.
So the electrical messages seem to 

70
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:25,510
travel a little bit more efficiency 
efficiently.

71
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,900
They are slightly faster in simple 
reflex test.

72
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,710
So it goes right down to the level of.
Because they're simple reflex light goes

73
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:37,711
on question bottom.
There's not many neurons mediating that 

74
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:37,711
response,
you know,

75
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,670
chains of neurons.
There's only a few neurons communicating

76
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:44,671
so that you can do that.
But even at that relatively simple 

77
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,930
processing level,
Iq is associated with speed.

78
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:51,931
So there's a physiological component,
you're less likely to develop 

79
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:52,360
Alzheimer's disease if you have a high 
Iq.

80
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,360
And maybe that's because your brain is 
just more robust,

81
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,940
you know,
so you could sustain damage,

82
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:01,450
say up to 50 percent of your brain and 
you wouldn't even show it if you're,

83
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,460
if you have a sufficiently high Iq.

84
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,130
Whereas if you're,
you know,

85
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,510
if you're on the bottom end of the ICU 
distribution,

86
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:09,940
you're much more,
you seem to be much more susceptible to,

87
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,350
to physiological damage.
Nutrition is a big predictor of Iq 

88
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,870
variation.
So,

89
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,960
and a lot of that's been hammered out of
modern societies,

90
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:22,600
you know,
so 150 years ago,

91
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,020
people's Iq was pretty tightly 
associated with their nutritional 

92
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,020
status.
But now,

93
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,550
you know,
there are very few people in North 

94
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,500
America who don't have enough to eat 
even though there's some variation in 

95
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,710
quality of diet.
And that's flat note a lot of the,

96
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,750
uh,
cultural variability in an intelligence.
