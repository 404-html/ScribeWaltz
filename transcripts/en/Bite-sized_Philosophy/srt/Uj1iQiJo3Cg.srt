1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,800
Young had this idea that people's 
shadows reach all the way down to hell,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,860
which is a very frightening concept and 
what he meant by that is is that if you 

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,510
take a look at the impulses that drive 
you,

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,630
that are actually malevolent,
if you can admit to such impulses that 

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,270
if you basically follow those all the 
way down to their origin,

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:26,271
you find some very nasty things and what
you find down there basically as what 

7
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:30,350
allies you with people who've done 
terrible things and that that's not a 

8
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:34,980
very pleasant experience.
I would say.

9
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:39,981
Although one thing that's worth thinking
about is that it is something that can 

10
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:43,560
protect you against being very,
very badly hurt.

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,250
Because one of the things that 
characterizes people who develop 

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,481
posttraumatic stress disorder is that 
they're often naive and then they 

13
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:57,771
encounter something that's really not 
within their framework of thinking and 

14
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:01,101
it's usually something bad and because 
there there isn't anything in their 

15
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:05,211
philosophy,
their way of looking at the world that 

16
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:05,211
has prepared them for that.

17
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:08,990
They ended up fragmented and devastated 
and so it's actually protective to you.

18
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:14,961
If you can figure out what your.
What your full range of capabilities is 

19
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,570
because that can help you understand 
other people a lot better and and uh,

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,310
to be wiser and more careful in your 
actions.

21
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,330
It's also useful,
I think if you want to convince yourself

22
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,710
to act properly because if you regard 
yourself as harmless,

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,340
which is a big mistake,
then nothing you can do is really that 

24
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,190
bad,
right?

25
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,220
Because you're harmless after all.
But if you understand that you're 

26
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,191
seriously not harmless,
then that can make you a lot more 

27
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,400
careful with yourself.
And I would say that,

28
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,160
that that's especially true.
Maybe when you're dealing,

29
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,560
when you have kids and you start dealing
with your kids.

30
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,220
If you know that what you're capable of 
because you're human,

31
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,940
then that can motivate you to be much 
more careful with what you say and do.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,680
And I don't mean cautious.
I don't mean timid.

33
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,480
I don't.
I don't mean any of that.

34
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:10,470
I just mean that you want to keep things
pristine between you and your children,

35
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:15,471
let's say,
because that way they're on your good 

36
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:18,111
side and you want them on your good side
because children who get on their 

37
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:22,251
parents bad side suffer very badly for 
it and sometimes it's because they're 

38
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:27,231
literally abused,
but more often it's because they get 

39
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,830
while they get abused,
let's say,

40
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:33,720
or neglected and much more subtle ways 
and you're definitely capable of that.

41
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:38,721
I mean all you have to do is think about
the way that you've interacted with 

42
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:42,081
someone that you've decided to not like 
or maybe someone you genuinely don't 

43
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:42,081
like.
You know,

44
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,670
and that can range from just not paying 
any attention to them,

45
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:49,671
especially if they're doing something 
good to really pursuing them and making 

46
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:53,361
their life miserable.
And you can certainly do that with your 

47
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:53,950
family members and you can do that with 
your intimate partner.

48
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:56,640
So you can do that with your friends and
you can do it with yourself.

49
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:59,980
And so it's really worth knowing that 
so.

50
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,560
Well,
the Fox thinks he's royal rule breaker,

51
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,290
but he's really just a two bit thug and 
this is where he.

52
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,990
He learns that.
So sorry,

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,650
I have a new phone and I'm kind of 
stupid with it still so.

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,270
Well hypothetically that'll work,
but it probably won't.

55
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,490
Anyways.
The,

56
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,810
the coach ones got these guys in his 
grasp now regardless and partly because 

57
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:38,631
they're already down this road and they 
can't back off and partly because he 

58
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:41,781
also offers them more money than they've
seen before and so as bad as they are,

59
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,060
they're going to get worse.
Many of you I presume have seen breaking

60
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:48,150
bad and that's a really good example of 
the,

61
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,350
of the incorporation at least in part or
maybe the possession by the shadow from 

62
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:54,960
the Union perspective,
right?

63
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:59,961
Because you have this ordinary high 
school teacher who really thinks that 

64
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:01,530
he's an ax and his family as well.
You know,

65
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:04,680
like your typical persona.
Roughly speaking,

66
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,860
he's just a normal guy,
but part of the reason that he's a 

67
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,281
normal guy is because he actually hasn't
been put in abnormal circumstances and 

68
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:14,730
then all of a sudden he is and he has a 
genuine moral conundrum.

69
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,730
Right?
He's going to die of lung cancer and 

70
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,920
his.
He has a son who's got a lot of health 

71
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,831
problems and he's terrified that that 
he's going to leave his wife and his 

72
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,980
child behind with nothing and then of 
course as the story and so he decides to

73
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:33,981
do something that temporarily that he 
regards as what they would normally 

74
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:36,930
regard as reprehensible.
And of course he just gets tangled up in

75
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:38,880
that.
But then as the story unfolds,

76
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:43,881
you see that there's.
It's more complicated because it's not 

77
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:45,330
that he was just innocent,
good guy and he decided to turn bad.

78
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:50,331
He's also very resentful and angry and 
it's partly because he's a bit of a 

79
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,050
pushover at the beginning or maybe more 
than a bit of a pushover,

80
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,010
and also that he didn't really fulfill 
his own potential and that,

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,620
you know,
he,

82
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,630
he had friends who walked down the 
entrepreneurial path and maybe they 

83
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,890
weren't quite fair to him,
but whatever,

84
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,060
he ends up not very successful as a high
school teacher.

85
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,090
So he's really angry about that.
And so there's more motivation for him 

86
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,360
opening up the door to the terrible 
elements of his personality than just 

87
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,700
the fact that he's got good motivations 
to do so and that,

88
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,090
that unfolds,
you know,

89
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:25,590
and so you see that warps and twists and
is resentful.

90
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,980
Character increasingly manifest 
themselves as he walks down this road to

91
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,150
really total brutality.
And it,

92
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:32,780
it's,
it's,

93
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,930
it's quite good.
Um,

94
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,830
there's a book called ordinary men 
that's a lot like that.

95
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,170
I don't think I've mentioned that to you
before,

96
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:43,500
but ordinary men is a book about.
It's the best book of it's type.

97
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,190
Maybe it's the only book of its type.
It's possible,

98
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:49,890
but it's plotted,
much like breaking bad in some sense.

99
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:54,891
It's a story about these German 
policemen in early stages of World War 

100
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:01,170
II and they were guys who were old 
enough to be raised in Germany really 

101
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,340
before the hitlarian propaganda came out
in full force,

102
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,630
you know,
if you were a teenager,

103
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,790
say in the 1930,
so you are going to be pulled right into

104
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:12,791
the propaganda machine and maybe you 
were part of the Hitler youth and like 

105
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:12,791
you were raised in that,
you know,

106
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:17,410
but if you were older than you were 
raised before that and you're not as 

107
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,040
amenable to propaganda once you're older
than about.

108
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,310
While I would say about 22 or something 
like that.

109
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,140
It's,
it's pretty young actually.

110
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,470
If you're gonna make a soldier,
you have to get a soldier young because 

111
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,620
once people are in their early twenties,
say they're kind of.

112
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,660
They already have their personality 
developed.

113
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,140
Anyways.
These policemen were sent into Poland 

114
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,980
after the Germans marched through and 
uh,

115
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,730
you know,
it was wartime and there is this 

116
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,910
hypothesis in Germany that the Jews in 
particular,

117
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:51,911
we're operating as a fifth column and 
undermining the German war effort 

118
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,031
because of course the Germans blamed the
Jews and a variety of other people for 

119
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:57,110
actually setting up the conditions that 
made the war necessary.

120
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:59,120
And so when the police were sent into 
Poland,

121
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,170
they were also required to make peace 
roughly speaking.

122
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:08,171
And so they started up by.
They started out by rounding up all the 

123
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:11,060
Jewish men between 18 and 65 and 
gathering them in,

124
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,640
in stadiums and then shipping them off 
on the trains.

125
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,910
But that isn't where they ended.
They ended in a very,

126
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:18,260
very dark place.
I mean,

127
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:23,261
these guys were going out in the field 
with naked pregnant women and shooting 

128
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:24,440
them in the back of the head by the end 
of their training.

129
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,830
And what's really interesting about that
is that is that their commander told him

130
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:34,160
that they could go home at any time.
So this is,

131
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,070
this is not one of those examples of 
people following orders.

132
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,400
And the reason they didn't,
roughly speaking,

133
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:45,401
there's many reasons,
but one of the reasons they didn't is 

134
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:45,401
because they didn't think it was 
comradely,

135
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:47,110
so to speak,
to leave their,

136
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,190
the guys they were working with to do 
all the dirty work and run off now.

137
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,840
And that's really,
that's really an interesting fact,

138
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,170
you know,
because you'd in,

139
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,270
in different circumstances,
you wouldn't think about that as 

140
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,270
reprehensible,
right?

141
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,360
You'd think,
well that's part of teamwork and on your

142
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:07,361
rough circumstances.
And that's at least in part how they 

143
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,091
viewed it.
And they were also made physically ill 

144
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:12,760
multiple times physically and 
psychologically ill by the things that 

145
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,490
they had to do.
But they kept doing them anyways.

146
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:19,210
So it's one step at a time.

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,340
in very bad places one step at a time.
So you've gotta watch those steps.
