1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,320
Sometimes things do not go well,
that that's self evident,

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,470
but here's the rub.
Sometimes when things are not going 

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,311
well,
it's precisely that which is most 

4
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:17,671
valued.
That is the cause why?

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,570
It's because the world is revealed 
through the template of your values.

6
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:25,930
If the world you are seeing is not the 
world you want,

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,320
therefore it's time to examine your 
values.

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,370
It's time to rid yourself of your 
current presuppositions.

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,300
There's a famous experiment that I've 
alluded to a couple of times I believe 

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,230
in this lecture series,
the invisible gorilla experiment,

11
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:44,740
and in the invisible gorilla experiment,
there's two teams

12
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,340
of players,
each with three members,

13
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:50,470
one dressed in black and the other 
dressed in white,

14
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:55,471
and each team is passing the basketball 
back and forth to the team members and 

15
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:59,380
milling about.
You'll see a video of them doing so.

16
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:04,381
They've basically filled the video 
screen and the white team is passing a 

17
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:08,311
basketball to the white team.
Members in the block team is passing a 

18
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,950
basketball to the black team members and
your job as,

19
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,210
as far as the experimenters concerned,
is for you to count the number of times 

20
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,890
that the black black team,
black team passes the basketball back 

21
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,340
and forth.
So that's what you do.

22
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:26,341
So now you have an ambition and a name 
and a value and the ambition and the aim

23
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:31,891
and the value.
They're all the same thing and that is 

24
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:31,990
to perform well at the task.
Now the thing that's so cool about this,

25
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,110
and this is really so cool,
it's just unbelievably.

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,380
It's just unbelievable that this is the 
case.

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,800
It's like a complete validation of of a 
certain element of the Buddhist 

28
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,311
worldview.
So they pass the ball for a couple of 

29
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:48,820
minutes and then the experimenter says 
to you,

30
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:54,210
how many?
And you say 15 and because you're happy 

31
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:54,210
and you're happy with yourself because 
you've been paying attention,

32
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,960
and then the experimenter says,
yeah,

33
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:57,160
that's right.
Or maybe not.

34
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:59,830
Maybe you missed one.
And then the experimenter says,

35
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:02,710
did you see the gorilla?
And half of you say,

36
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,090
what?
What?

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,370
What gorilla?
Like,

38
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:09,460
really?
And he and the experimenter says yes,

39
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:14,461
and then he rewinds it and plays the 
video and like a minute and a half into 

40
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:15,670
the three minute video,
sure enough,

41
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,030
in walks this guy in a gorilla suit,
six foot three or so stands in the 

42
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,310
middle of the game,
right in the middle of the game,

43
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,850
the same size as the players,
perfectly obviously evident beats his 

44
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:35,821
chest for like a second and a half and 
then sorta saunders off and half the 

45
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:39,760
people who watch the video don't see the
gorilla,

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,910
which is absolutely shocking.

47
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,910
And what that means is that your 
ambitions blind you to the nature of 

48
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,140
reality.
Now they eliminate some reality,

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,610
but they blind you to most of it and 
that's fine because you're not.

50
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,830
There's not a lot of you.
In some ways,

51
00:02:56,831 --> 00:03:01,831
you're very pinpoint thing like a laser 
and so you just can't be attending to 

52
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:04,360
everything all the time.
But one of the things that you might ask

53
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:09,361
yourself once you know that is that if 
you're suffering dreadfully than one 

54
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:12,520
possibility,
is that you're so fixed on the point.

55
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,550
You're so fixed on a point.
The fact that you're so fixed on the 

56
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,351
point that you're fixed on might be 
integrally related to why things are 

57
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:25,000
going so catastrophic,
really wrong now,

58
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:30,001
perhaps not because you know there's a 
lot of arbitrary ness about life and 

59
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,080
perhaps you suffer even when you don't 
deserve to.

60
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,450
That seems to happen in the book of job,
for example,

61
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,570
because job is a good guy and God has a 
bet with Satan,

62
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:42,571
which seems like another relatively 
nasty thing to do to let's say just 

63
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:46,081
torture him and he does quite nicely to 
see if he'll turn against God and it 

64
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,270
seems like a rather playground sort of 
thing for God to engage in.

65
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,860
But the point is is that even in a 
document like the Old Testament,

66
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,861
there's ample suggestion that sometimes 
people just get wiped out and hurt even 

67
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:07,150
if they're living good moral lives,
aiming properly and all that.

68
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:11,470
There's an arbitrary agnes in life 
that's not radical,

69
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:16,471
but it's possible that it's what you're 
clinging to that's hurting you and it's 

70
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:20,710
even possible.
That's the thing that you're clinging to

71
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:25,711
the hardest that's hurting you the most.
That could easily be someone you love 

72
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:28,741
like lots of times I see people in 
therapy and they're miserable for one 

73
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:32,641
reason or another.
Sometimes it's because they have a very 

74
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:34,630
close relationship with a family member 
and that just isn't working.

75
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,990
You know the family member for the sake 
of simplicity we'll say is not really 

76
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:43,480
oriented towards helping them have a 
good life.

77
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,900
The family member is instead oriented 
towards making them as bloody miserable 

78
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,140
as you can possibly make anyone and and 
what would you say?

79
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:58,290
Exploiting the bond between family 
members in order to enable that and then

80
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,190
sometimes the sacrifice that's necessary
is either merely distancing yourself 

81
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:12,181
from that person,
sometimes substantively and sometimes 

82
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:16,650
seriously distancing yourself from like 
we don't talk anymore ever and so that's

83
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:20,470
pretty damn rough and it hurts and all 
of that,

84
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:24,970
but,
but it's a good example of the fact that

85
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:29,971
sometimes in order to extract yourself 
from the miserable bit of chaos that you

86
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:36,751
happen to be in meshed in.
You have to let go of what you love 

87
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:40,140
best.
If the world you are seeing is not the 

88
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,011
world you want,
therefore it's time to examine your 

89
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,000
values are it's really worth.
It's really worth thinking about because

90
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:48,760
the alternative to is to curse fate,
right?

91
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:51,550
Because if it isn't you and there's 
nothing you can do to change,

92
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,260
there isn't something you're doing 
that's wrong.

93
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,260
Then it's faded itself.
It's the world itself.

94
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:58,910
It's other people let's say because 
they're a huge part of the world or it's

95
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,911
the nature of the world itself or,
or it's God himself in whatever forum 

96
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:08,861
you either believe in or don't believe 
in because it's fundamentally all the 

97
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:10,160
same in this sort of situation that I'm 
describing.

98
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,820
So.
And one of the things that's really 

99
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,651
interesting and I mentioned this before 
about the Israelites in the Old 

100
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:17,651
Testament,
is that they,

101
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:21,970
they got this right.
It's really something because what 

102
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,721
happens to the Israelites over and over 
in the Old Testament is that they get 

103
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:26,930
all puffed up about how wonderful they 
are,

104
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:31,931
and then they make moral errors because 
they're arrogant and then God comes 

105
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:35,981
along and just cuts them into pieces for
like generation after generation and 

106
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:40,130
they wobbled back to their feet and they
always maintain the same attitude,

107
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:42,140
which is we did something wrong.

108
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,030
We did something wrong.
It's like,

109
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,060
it's like.
It's like an axiom rather than 

110
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,091
observation is that if we're not,
if things are not laying themselves out 

111
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:55,310
for us as they should be,
then we cannot curse God.

112
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,180
We have to look to ourselves while and 
you think,

113
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,080
well,
why not curse?

114
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,960
God knows.
Maybe it's his fault.

115
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,640
That's a really good question and one of
the things that I've tried to figure out

116
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,610
over the last 30 years is,
well,

117
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:15,611
why not just curse God?
Because there is this arbitrary element 

118
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:18,941
to existence and we are vulnerable and 
there is plenty of suffering and things 

119
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:20,120
are unfair.
Like there's problems,

120
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:22,100
right?
There's injustice and unfairness and all

121
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:24,110
of these things and an endless 
suffering.

122
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:29,111
So why not just laid at the feet of God 
and the whether God exists or not in 

123
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:30,350
some sense,
by the way,

124
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,310
with regards to the metaphysics of this 
particular discussion is not relevant.

125
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,310
It's the point remains the same either 
way and the answer is as far as I can 

126
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,171
tell that if you refuse to take on the 
responsibility yourself and you 

127
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:49,751
attempted to lay it at the feet of 
either society or being itself,

128
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,040
then you instantly start to act in a way
that makes everything much worse,

129
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,340
not only for you but for everyone else 
and maybe even for being itself and so 

130
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,440
it's not helpful.
Now,

131
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,840
if you're.
If you decide that it's you,

132
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:08,270
you've got the problem.
Maybe that's not even true.

133
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:13,271
Like maybe you are someone who's being 
tortured by the bet between God and 

134
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:15,410
Satan and like too bad for you.
If that happens to be the case,

135
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,680
but it still seems to be the appropriate
thing for a human being who's standing 

136
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:27,701
on his or her own two feet in a proper 
manner to take the responsibility on for

137
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:30,140
themselves.

138
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,440
Regardless of the counter arguments that
might be made against,

139
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,160
that's really something.
It's time to rid yourself of your 

140
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,931
current presuppositions.
I also think of that it's a deadwood 

141
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:43,931
issue.
You know,

142
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:47,770
one of the things you see with motifs 
like the pair of the Phoenix,

143
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,420
remember when Harry Potter goes off to 
fight,

144
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,960
he's like St George.
He goes off to fight the hell is that 

145
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,250
thing,
the basilisk that turns you to stone.

146
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:58,650
When you look at it to dragon,
for all intents and purposes,

147
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,540
it's guarding avert urgent.
What's her name for?

148
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,750
Not Virginia.
It's close to that though.

149
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,880
Jenny.
Jenny Ginevra,

150
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:11,030
right?
Which is a variant of virgin and very 

151
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,030
introvert,
Virginia.

152
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,670
Well,
when he gets bitten by the,

153
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,950
by the dragon and poisoned,
that's the dragon of chaos,

154
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:21,951
right?
The thing that turns you to stone when 

155
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:21,951
you look at it,
when he gets bitten by it,

156
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:23,700
then he's going to die and yeah.

157
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Well,
if you get bitten by the thing that 

158
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:28,700
turns you to stone when you look at it,
if it bites you,

159
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,280
man,
if you're not dead,

160
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:30,960
you're gonna wish you are.
It's one of the two.

161
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,430
And then the phoenix flies in and cries 
tears into the wound and that heals 

162
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,710
them.
And the Phoenix is the thing that allows

163
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:42,660
the dead wood to burn off occasionally,
let's say.

164
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:42,960
Well,
it's.

165
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:47,961
I think it's once every hundred years 
with the Phoenix and of course it's 

166
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:50,691
pretty dramatic.
The whole damn bird has to go up in 

167
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:50,691
flames and then there's nothing left but
an egg.

168
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,460
But there's a very serious message there
too,

169
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,470
which is that you can compare yourself 
in some sense to a forest fire,

170
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,900
to a forest in a forest,
has to burn now and then for the 

171
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,111
deadwood to clear so that the forest can
actually maintain its continued 

172
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:06,111
existence.

173
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:08,940
And if you stop the forest from burning 
for a prolonged period of time,

174
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:13,941
which happened in the United States when
they were trying to manage the forest 

175
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:17,241
fires too tightly,
then all that happens is the dead would 

176
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,390
accumulate and accumulate and 
accumulates and accumulates and 

177
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,790
accumulates until the whole damn forest 
is dead wood.

178
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,590
And then lightning hits it and it burned
so hot that it burns the topsoil off.

179
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,800
And then there's nothing left.
Nothing grows.

180
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:33,801
And so that's a good moral lesson,
which is don't wait too long to let the 

181
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:34,560
dam did,
would burn off,

182
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,620
you know,
maybe a little self immolation on a 

183
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,861
daily basis.
Might be preferable to burning yourself 

184
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:44,910
all the way down to the bedrock once 
every 20 years or so because maybe there

185
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,800
won't be anything left of you when you 
do that.

186
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,490
And you know that happens to people all 
the time.

187
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,750
I've seen that happen to people many,
many times.

188
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,540
The deadwood accumulates the mess around
them,

189
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,300
gathers the chaos that they haven't 
dealt with accumulates.

190
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,510
And then one day the spark comes in and 
they burned so far and so fast that 

191
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,350
there's not enough left of them to 
recover.

192
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,460
And then they're the people who've been 
eaten by the beast there have been eaten

193
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,530
by the dragon and now we're inside its 
belly.

194
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Another very common architectural motif.
And while maybe a hero will come along 

195
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,400
and rescue them or maybe they'll just 
stay in there forever.

196
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,010
And that's a precursor to the idea of 
hell.

197
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,990
And it's not something I would 
recommend.

198
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,010
So a little medicine on a regular basis 
is a lot better too.

199
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,040
Then total emulation on terms other than
your own sporadically.
