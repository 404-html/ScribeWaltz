1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,810
Well then there's food,
Cole Cole,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,590
who I have no respect for by the way,
I think.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,070
I think I've read a fair bit of full 
cool and I think everything he says is 

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,680
obvious.
So for example,

5
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,040
he criticizes the idea of mental illness
as a,

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,530
as a social construct.
It's like,

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,630
well,
yeah,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,840
obviously,
I mean it's not like psychiatrists and 

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,591
psychologists and mental health 
professionals who are relatively well 

10
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:33,681
informed,
haven't known about that since for the 

11
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:36,171
last 60 years.
I mean it might be a revelation to 

12
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:40,401
people who who don't notice that psyche 
psychiatry for example,

13
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:46,011
is something like a compromise between 
the patient biology and the social 

14
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:47,340
world.
You know what I mean?

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,050
Psychiatric ailments often have a 
biological tilt,

16
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:57,051
but the way they manifest themselves in 
society is clearly conditioned in very 

17
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:02,130
intense ways by the particular 
conditions.

18
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,150
Obtaining at the point that the person 
who has that biological predisposition 

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,181
exists even whether or not that's 
pathological can be tilted one way or 

20
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:12,930
another by the cultural norms.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,200
And then of course,
when you're dealing with issues like 

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,050
insurance payment and treatment and 
hospitalization,

23
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,230
obviously you're pulling in all sorts of
systems that are by no means purely 

24
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,911
scientific,
but I don't find it particularly useful 

25
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:30,990
critique.
It's obvious as far as I'm concerned.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,510
And the other thing that the code did,
I mean I think this is the typical,

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,160
especially the French intellectuals,
typical sleight of hand.

28
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:43,020
Once Marxism became,
you know,

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,170
once you were no longer able to call 
yourself a committed Marxist because 

30
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,260
committed Marxism had led to 
unbelievable brutality,

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,390
you know,
on a scale that had never,

32
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:59,310
probably never been experienced in the 
entire history of the planet,

33
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:02,490
at least in terms of its reach and 
duration.

34
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,400
You didn't get to call yourself a 
Marxist anymore,

35
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:07,890
although there were still people and you
still see them saying,

36
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:12,891
well that wasn't real Marxism.
Which I think is a cop out of staggering

37
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:14,190
proportions.

38
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,570
That usually means,
well,

39
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:18,330
if I was the person running the country,
that wouldn't have happened.

40
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,820
You know,
that's the logic behind it.

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,580
They didn't put the principles into 
practice properly.

42
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,090
It's like,
yeah,

43
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:29,091
well lots of people put the damn 
principles into practice and the same 

44
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:32,030
thing happened everywhere,
so at some point you have to kind of 

45
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,490
wonder if there's something wrong with 
the principals.

46
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,940
Anyways.
What Fico did was take the Marxist 

47
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,470
presupposition that everything was,
could be boiled down to economics and 

48
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,450
economic power and translated it into 
the idea that everything just boiled 

49
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,260
down to power,
you know,

50
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,290
and the reason that we have institutions
is to include and exclude and that the 

51
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,540
institutions always run for the benefit 
of those at the top.

52
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,260
It's like,
well,

53
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,520
yeah,
that's a little bit true,

54
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,830
but it's,
you know,

55
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:06,831
it's,
it's a scientist would look at that and 

56
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:06,831
say,
yeah,

57
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:06,831
well probably,
you know,

58
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:11,160
power dynamics in a,
in a functioning economic and political 

59
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,421
system,
maybe account for 10 percent of the 

60
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:15,421
variant,
something like that,

61
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:15,421
maybe 15 percent.

62
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:19,770
So for example,
if you have a say you want to go to an 

63
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,260
ivy league school while if your parents 
went to the school,

64
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:28,261
you're more likely to get in,
but you're not that much more likely to 

65
00:03:28,261 --> 00:03:28,261
get in.
And you still have to be,

66
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,590
you know,
roughly speaking,

67
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:32,530
what happens is that if you have a 
pretty decent,

68
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,520
you know,
high school gpa and you do very well on 

69
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,131
the sats and you have some other talents
of some sort because that's also 

70
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:45,331
necessary.
Then they might pick you over someone 

71
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:48,121
else who's roughly will you qualified if
you have a familial history of 

72
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:51,811
attendance at school.
So obviously you get an exec and an 

73
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:52,360
advantage,
but it's not.

74
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,040
It's not the kind of advantage that 
accounts for the entirety of how the 

75
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,120
system is structured.
It's an advantage.

76
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,890
While you can say,
well that's not fair.

77
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,460
It's like,
yeah,

78
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:05,410
okay,
fair enough.

79
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,330
Most systems are certainly not 100 
percent either.

80
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:15,331
Fair or just definitely not,
but you know,

81
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:21,601
instead of comparing them to utopia,
you might compare them to another 

82
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:25,321
system,
which is the only reasonable way to do 

83
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:25,321
it.
It's like everything looks terrible when

84
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:27,910
you compare it to the best thing you can
possibly imagine,

85
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,770
but the best thing you can possibly 
imagine is it's an empty fiction because

86
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:37,771
it's so devoid of detailed content that 
you can't use it as a guide to reality.

87
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,860
Now,
I mean the idea that things could be 

88
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,231
better has its roots in in some sense,
in a broad scale Utopian project and I 

89
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:52,681
believe that things could be better,
but that doesn't mean that when you're 

90
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:56,281
doing an analysis of a complex system,
you get to compare it to an ideological 

91
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:58,360
utopia and then describe all the reasons
that it's bad.

92
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,330
It's not appropriate to do that.
It's too simplistic.

93
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:09,751
You're not going to do anything to 
actually address the problems that the 

94
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:13,321
system has.
If you take that approach and then of 

95
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:17,791
course like pure utopian thinking is 
extraordinarily dangerous because if you

96
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:22,861
think that your way of molding society 
into some ultimate state of perfection 

97
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,500
is headed towards some ultimate state of
perfection,

98
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,890
then you can justify absolutely anything
you do right now on the basis of the 

99
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,760
fact that things are going to improve so
radically.

100
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:39,520
In the future,
and that means any of your behaviors are

101
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:41,620
excused.
The end is worth it.

102
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,510
Well,
if someone says that you have to kind of

103
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:51,511
wonder what they're actually planning,
excuse me,

104
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,440
what they're actually planning to do.
So.

105
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,970
Okay.
So,

106
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:00,020
well,
what's the issue?

107
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,050
Well,
the issue is that it's so the same 

108
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,450
critic with regards to Food Co.
He said,

109
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:08,710
you know,
it's basically the same thing that food,

110
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,670
coal criticized a variety of low,
you know,

111
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,750
profound institutions,
sexual institution say like marriage and

112
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:23,620
then institutions of power like prisons 
and institutions of um,

113
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,950
mental health,
you know,

114
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,630
the whole institutional framework.

115
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,110
He criticized them on the basis of power
and exclusion and you could do that and 

116
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:35,540
there's some truth in it.
But you know,

117
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,670
food,
coal also made the presupposition.

118
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:42,671
The problem with that presupposition is 
that everything is about something else 

119
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:46,670
is that it's almost impossible to see 
how it can be applied to fuko himself.

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,000
So you'd have to ask if you were a 
student of flintco,

121
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,030
what power aims drove his attempt to 
analyze everything in terms of power.

122
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,840
And I actually think with google it's 
pretty obvious.

123
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,470
So,
but it,

124
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,350
it's a game that never goes anywhere.
