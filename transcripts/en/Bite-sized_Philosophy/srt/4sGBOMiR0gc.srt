1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,530
It's a great thing to know with people 
like in your relationships here,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,630
here's the key to a good relationship.
It's not the only one,

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:11,160
but watch your person carefully,
carefully,

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,430
carefully,
and whenever they do something that you 

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,711
would like them to do more of,
tell them that that was really good and 

6
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:22,821
mean it and it's not manipulative 
because if it's manipulative it won't 

7
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:22,821
work.
It's like you have to say,

8
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:24,030
wow,
I'm so glad you did that.

9
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:29,031
Did you have to be precise?
Here's what you just did that I thought 

10
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:30,450
was great and Oh boy,
that's so nice that you've noticed.

11
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:32,310
I can't believe they could notice.
It's like,

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,830
you know,
you do that 20 times and the person will

13
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:39,831
be like the rat.
That's just pushing the lever for 

14
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:39,831
cocaine.
You know,

15
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:39,831
so,
but no,

16
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,510
I'm serious.
It's skinner established this bf skinner

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,860
noticed this a long time ago.

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,270
Reward is intensely useful in terms of 
modifying behavior,

19
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:53,271
but the problem is is that it's really 
hard to notice when things are going 

20
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:54,090
right,
right?

21
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:59,091
Because you're kind of prime to notice 
when things are going wrong and so you 

22
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:02,781
use threat and punishment more often as 
agents of of shaping the people that 

23
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,450
you're around.
Because you know when everything's going

24
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:07,170
right,
it's like,

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,280
what are you going to say?
Everything's going right.

26
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,330
It turns to zero.
You just assume it and that's not good.

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,210
That's not good.
You want to pay attention and if the.

28
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,890
If you're a person,
your children,

29
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:21,720
your wife,
your whoever,

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,940
your mother,
your sister,

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,480
if you want them to,
if you want to rectify your 

32
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,801
relationships with them,
and I'm not saying to do this in a 

33
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:33,801
manipulative wait,
won't work,

34
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:38,420
but if they do something that's 
promoting harmony and peace and 

35
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,700
goodwill,
it's like attend to it.

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,150
Tell them that you noticed.
It's like it's so useful and you have to

37
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:45,060
get rid of your grudges and your 
resentment to do that,

38
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,120
right?
Because you don't want you to kind of 

39
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,120
mad at your sister and then you know she
does something good.

40
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,080
You think there is no god damn way,
I'm going to reward you for that.

41
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:54,360
So you ignore her when she does 
something good.

42
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,980
It's like,
that's brilliant.

43
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:59,460
That is because then you've just 
punished her for doing what you want.

44
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,070
And people do that with their kids all 
the time,

45
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,500
you know,
because they let the kids dominate them.

46
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,100
Then they get resentful.
Then the kid will run up to them to show

47
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:10,500
them something that's kind of 
spectacular and they'll,

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,140
they're not happy.
They'll say,

49
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,840
oh yeah,
that's,

50
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,500
you know,
I'm,

51
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:14,340
I'm,
I'm working.

52
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,180
You know,
little kid has all sad about that and 

53
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,670
he's just learned something so.

54
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,130
And it's not perhaps what you want them 
to learn.

55
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,820
And so you have to keep your,
your relationship with your children 

56
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,271
pristine.
And that means that you can't hold a 

57
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:35,901
grudge or resent them.
And that means that you have to help 

58
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:36,690
them learn how to behave so that you 
liked them.

59
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,140
And that way if they,
if you like them and you're kind of 

60
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,930
sensible and maybe your partner also 
likes them.

61
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:45,120
So you know,
you got a consensus going there,

62
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,270
there's a reasonable possibility that 
other people will actually liked them 

63
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,700
too,
including other children.

64
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,730
And then the world will open up to them,
you know,

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,760
then you'll bring them to people's 
houses and the people will actually 

66
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,910
smile at them and them a pat on the head
and instead of thinking,

67
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,940
oh my God,
that Brad's coming to visit again,

68
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,170
I wonder what it will break this time,
you know?

69
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,170
And that's just a horrible thing for 
your child to experience repetitively in

70
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:15,781
situation after situation.
All they learned is that adults have a 

71
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:17,590
false smile,
but they're really lying all the time.

72
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,230
God,
it's like a bit of hell.

73
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,540
And there's a lot of children who are 
trapped in that.

74
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:27,541
It's really awful to see.
I can see kids like that when I walked 

75
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:27,541
down the street,
you know,

76
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,270
it's like their little doomed things and
there they are and you know,

77
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,630
they're screwed in 15 different ways and
there's no way out of it.

78
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,660
It's really awful.
So I would not recommend that you do 

79
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,771
that.
It's better to notice that you're a bit 

80
00:03:43,771 --> 00:03:45,841
of a monster or a lot of a monster.
And notice that you are much happier 

81
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:52,171
with the people around you when they 
behave in accordance with reasonable 

82
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:55,531
social social norms,
and then you actually feel genuinely 

83
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:57,970
connected to them and you want to work 
on their behalf so that everything works

84
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:02,971
out.
But if you think you're a good person 

85
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:03,460
and that you'd never do anything that 
was harmful to your children,

86
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:08,461
then you can just forget about that 
because you'll never take it seriously 

87
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:08,461
enough to actually learn.
