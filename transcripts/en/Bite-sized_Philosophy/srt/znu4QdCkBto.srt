1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,850
By noon the dragon filled the house,
its head hung out the front door,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,050
it's tail hung out the backdoor and 
there wasn't a room in the house that 

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,050
didn't have some part of the dragon in 
it.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,410
I bet that there is a house like that on
some of you will live.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,700
You know,
where there's a lot of houses,

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,440
some of you live in apartments,
doesn't really matter,

7
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:20,350
but I bet you if you live in a house on 
a block of houses,

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,560
there's at least one house on that 
street where the tail of the dragon has 

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,761
started to come out of the house and you
know what that's like it because it's 

10
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:31,030
the house that you don't really want to 
look at when you walk by,

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,140
you know,
and maybe,

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,700
I don't know,
that needs a new roof and like the doors

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,030
a little bit crooked and the law isn't 
cotton.

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,270
You know,
there's some rusty things lying around 

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,270
there and like it's just not taken care 
of.

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,190
And you know,
and maybe you know from the gossip in 

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,190
the neighborhood to that there's 
something going on in that house.

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,860
It is just not good.
And it's gotten to the point where it's 

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,661
so not good that it's starting to spread
itself out beyond the domestic confines 

20
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,490
of the house.
So you know,

21
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:02,491
you,
you run into people like that now and 

22
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:02,491
then too,
you'll notice this.

23
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:02,491
So you know,
sometimes,

24
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:03,760
I don't know if this has happened to any
of you,

25
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:06,340
but it might have happened to you in 
some ways.

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,520
You know that there are those people who
can't not tell you everything about 

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,820
what's going on in their life,
even if you've hardly even met them.

28
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,340
If you see someone who's really in 
trouble,

29
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,800
you know,
you'll sit on the bus and somebody who's

30
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,360
clearly on the road to being thoroughly 
de deranged,

31
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:27,361
we'll sit down beside you and they'll 
start telling you about the problems of 

32
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:27,361
their life.

33
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:27,361
It's like,
you know,

34
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:32,041
that the dragon that they're dealing 
with is so big that they can't even 

35
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,951
contain it.
They're so desperate to have it dealt 

36
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:36,790
with that they can't not talk about it.
You know?

37
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:39,010
And there's lots of people like that.
They're the ones that.

38
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:41,620
What is that stupid little phrase,
Tmi.

39
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:43,390
Is that right?
Too much information.

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,410
It's like,
yeah,

41
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:49,411
well why does that happen?
It's because people are dealing with 

42
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:52,651
anomalies and unexpected occurrences and
tragedies and they cannot articulate a 

43
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:55,930
solution and most people think by 
talking,

44
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,780
which is also part of the reason that 
therapy works.

45
00:01:58,781 --> 00:01:59,590
It's right.
Well,

46
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:01,420
do you think.
I doubt it.

47
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,350
You might,
but very few people think you know,

48
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:10,351
and so if you want to solve a problem,
you want to talk it over with a friend 

49
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:11,170
and so you know,
you might just think that you're talking

50
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:13,480
about the problem sorta you know what 
the problem is,

51
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:15,010
but you're talking about so you don't.

52
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,060
When you talk about it,
you articulate the problem space.

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,510
You start to generate potential 
hypotheses about solutions,

54
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:24,280
but more than that,
if you're talking to someone,

55
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,550
you can watch them just like the little 
kid with the mouse would watch the 

56
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:29,550
mother.
It's like,

57
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,070
well,
here's what I think the problem is.

58
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:31,030
And if you go,
you know,

59
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:33,850
you're listening and you go like that.
You roll your eyes.

60
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:38,851
You know,
it's a hint to the person that maybe 

61
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:38,851
that's not the most appropriate way to 
formulate the problem.

62
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:40,780
Now maybe you don't roll your eyes,
but you know,

63
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:45,781
you don't encourage them or maybe they 
tell you what the problem is and you 

64
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:46,780
really actively engaged in.
You're nodding.

65
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:49,120
Well then they know that maybe they 
formulated that way,

66
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:54,121
someone have sane and tolerable would 
formulate it and then they can walk 

67
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:55,240
through the solution.
So,

68
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,520
so when you sit down beside someone and 
they have to tell you everything,

69
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:07,030
one of the things that you know is that 
they don't have anyone to listen to them

70
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,130
and part of what happens in therapy and 
a huge part of it is that you just 

71
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,031
listened.
I have one client that's all I ever do 

72
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,031
with her.
She comes in twice a week,

73
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,870
once every two weeks and I just sit 
there and listen to her for an hour and 

74
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,250
now I can maybe have a bit of a 
discussion with her for the last 10 

75
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,071
minutes.
But if I try to say anything for the 

76
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:29,650
first 50 minutes,
she just looks kinda irritated.

77
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:34,651
And you know,
it's like I've interrupted the flow of 

78
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:35,950
the,
of the interaction and she's alone.

79
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,700
She didn't have nobody to talk to,
so you know,

80
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,340
she wants to listen to herself,
I think,

81
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,670
and she can't do that by herself.
She has to have someone to do it with.

82
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,270
And so you know,
people think by talking and some people 

83
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,841
have no one to talk to and so their 
problems start to spill out and you 

84
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:58,651
know,
by that time you can't even help them 

85
00:03:58,651 --> 00:03:58,651
usually because if you listened for 
three years,

86
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:01,450
it wouldn't be enough listening.
Just listen forever and you never get to

87
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,170
the bottom of it.
