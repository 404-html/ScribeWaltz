00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,600
Sure.
Hi Dr Peterson over the last couple of 

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,740
weeks and further back,
you talk a lot about consciousness and 

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,381
the importance of it and I was hoping to
get your opinion on an issue of 

4
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:14,741
consciousness that has often seen 
Christianity among other groups and 

5
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:19,061
politics kind of clash,
so I'm hoping to get your views on the 

6
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:23,440
consciousness or lack thereof of a human
fetus and how that's impacted your views

7
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:25,740
on abortion,
whatever they are and any.

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,020
Cool.
Thank you.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,620
Thank you.
Okay,

10
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:51,710
so the first question is do I have an 
answer for that?

11
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:54,290
That's a good enough answer to actually 
reveal.

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,070
No,
I don't,

13
00:00:58,071 --> 00:01:03,071
but I'll.
I'll I can flail about a little bit 

14
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:04,370
around it.
Abortion is clearly wrong.

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,830
Don't think anybody debates that you 
wouldn't recommend that someone that you

16
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:12,650
love have one.
Okay.

17
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:17,651
Now,
having clarified that that mere 

18
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:20,810
statement doesn't eliminate the 
complexity of the situation.

19
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,520
The first question is,
is should everything wrong be illegal?

20
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,470
That's a tough question.
Everything that's wrong isn't illegal.

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,880
Then there's the additional complication
of the difference,

22
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:41,881
let's say,
in gravity regarding the problem in 

23
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:47,780
relationship to men and women and we 
don't know how to deal with that.

24
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,340
Having said that,
I would say that it's actually the wrong

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,400
question.
There's something Leonard Cohen said 

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,210
once he said that in a massacre,
there's no decent place to stand,

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,080
and what he meant by that was sometimes 
you're aware there is no good decision 

28
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,160
left,
no matter what you do.

29
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:08,850
It's wrong.

30
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,010
So then the question is how did you get 
there?

31
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,290
Well,
let's say you're in a position where you

32
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,340
are inclined to seek an abortion.
The question is,

33
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,270
how did you get there?
Now we have a lot to straighten out 

34
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,830
about the sexual relationships between 
men and women.

35
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,850
In the modern world,
they're bent and warped and demented out

36
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:36,851
of shape.
One of the things I see with young 

37
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:36,851
people,
for example,

38
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:39,700
is that they will engage in sexual acts 
with one another that they would not 

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,670
talk about with one another.
I mean,

40
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,280
couples will do that for that matter,
like married couples will do that,

41
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:46,040
but they're married.
That's a different story.

42
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,520
It seems to me that if you are willing 
to engage in a sexual act with someone 

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,250
with whom you would not discuss that 
act,

44
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:54,380
you probably put the cart before the 
horse,

45
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,370
so the discussion regarding the legality
of abortion is nested inside a larger 

46
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:08,161
discussion about the morality of 
abortion and that's nested inside a 

47
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:14,521
larger discussion about the proper place
of sexuality and human behavior and to 

48
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:19,000
me that's the level at which the problem
needs to be addressed.

49
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,870
Now I don't have the answer to that.
You know,

50
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,480
because they will answer was get married
now.

51
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:28,780
It's a good answer and it's an answer 
that people should still listen to,

52
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,990
but we'll put that aside momentarily.

53
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,540
I had a client at one point who was,
I don't know,

54
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,560
she was probably.
I'm not going to disguise her in a 

55
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,700
variety of different ways.
She was 27,

56
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:47,701
20 or thereabouts,
had come from a relatively conservative 

57
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:47,701
background,
quite a timid,

58
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:52,470
fearful person and also not very well,
not sophisticated in relationship to 

59
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,700
relationships and she'd never had sex.
Well,

60
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,110
there's a bunch of things she'd never 
done.

61
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,520
Well,

62
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,790
the answer from me to her wasn't 
continued to be timid about everything 

63
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,350
because that wasn't working out for her.
She needed to go have some adventures.

64
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Now,
sexual adventures like other adventures 

65
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,181
are dangerous and so you have to be very
careful when you encourage people to go 

66
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,600
out and have adventures,
but,

67
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,550
but,
but too much.

68
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:31,840
Timidity and caution also constitutes a 
pathway to perdition.

69
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:36,841
Let's say you can't just say to people 
in the morning world while you know,

70
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:42,781
sex till you're married,
unless you're going to get married when 

71
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:42,781
you're very young and perhaps you 
should.

72
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:47,641
I don't know about that,
but I don't think that we're mature 

73
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:52,120
enough as a culture to have a serious 
discussion about sexual impropriety,

74
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,250
especially in the aftermath of the birth
control pill.

75
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,920
And we seriously need to do that and we 
have it.

76
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,580
And so I think the eternal debate about 
abortion,

77
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:03,160
horrible as it is,
is a,

78
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,730
it's the surface manifestation of a much
deeper problem.

79
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,780
Now I talked a little bit today about 
the utility of marriage,

80
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:16,781
like the spiritual utility of marriage,
and that's something that I think we're 

81
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:20,480
so immaturely cynical as a culture like 
we don't.

82
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,660
We're not wise enough to look at an 
institution like marriage and to really 

83
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,060
think about what it means and what it 
signifies.

84
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:31,061
It signifies a place that people can tie
the ropes of their lives together so 

85
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:35,111
that they're stronger.
It signifies a place where people can 

86
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:36,020
tell the truth to one another.
It signifies a place where sexuality can

87
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:38,840
properly be integrated into life.
That's no easy.

88
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,810
That's no easy task.
It's a place where children,

89
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,630
at least in principle,
it can be put first and foremost as they

90
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:49,631
should be once they exist,
and so there's a much broader discussion

91
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:55,601
that has to happen.
I think before any concentration on the 

92
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:57,710
legality of abortion is labeled to get 
anywhere at all.

93
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,130
That's what it looks like to me,
so that's the best I can do with that 

94
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:03,130
question.

95
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,340
Thank you.
