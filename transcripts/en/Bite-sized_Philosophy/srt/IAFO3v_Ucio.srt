1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,440
I started to pay very careful attention 
to what I was saying.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,620
I don't know if that happened 
voluntarily or involuntarily,

3
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:12,621
but I could feel a sort of split 
developing in my psyche and the split 

4
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:16,611
and I've actually had students tell me 
the same thing has happened to them 

5
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:18,410
after they've listened to some of the 
material that,

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,620
that I've been describing to all of you,
but split into two,

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,390
let's say.
And one part was the,

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,690
let's say the old me that was talking a 
lot and that liked to argue and that 

9
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:37,860
liked ideas and there was another part 
that was watching that part,

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,920
like just with it's eyes open and 
neutrally judging and the part that was 

11
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:47,160
neutrally judging was watching the part 
that was talking and going,

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,820
that isn't your idea.
You don't really believe that you don't 

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,500
really know what you're talking about.
That isn't true.

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,060
And I thought,
hmm,

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,380
that's really interesting.
So now,

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,800
and that was happening to like 95 
percent of what I was saying and so then

17
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:03,150
I didn't really know what to do.
I thought,

18
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:04,230
okay,
this is strange,

19
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,950
so maybe I fragmented and that's just 
not a good thing at all.

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,130
I mean,
it wasn't like it was hearing voices or 

21
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:13,130
anything like that.
I mean,

22
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:13,930
it wasn't like that.
It was,

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,030
it was.
Well,

24
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:19,770
people have multiple parts,
so then I had this weird conundrum.

25
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:20,850
It's like,
well,

26
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:25,851
which of those two things are me?
Is it the part that's listening and 

27
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:26,280
saying,
no,

28
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,560
that's rubbish.
That's a lie.

29
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:31,320
That's you're doing that to impress 
people.

30
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,970
You're just trying to win the argument,
you know,

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,070
was that me or was the part that was 
going about my normal verbal business?

32
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:41,670
Me and I didn't know,
but I decided I would go with the critic

33
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,890
and then what I tried to do,
what I learned to do I think was to stop

34
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:51,891
saying things that made me weak and now 
that I mean I'm still trying to do that 

35
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:57,561
because I'm always feeling when I talk,
whether or not the words that I'm saying

36
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:01,170
are either making the align or making me
come apart,

37
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,180
and I think the alignment.

38
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,180
I really do think the alignment is.
I think alignment is the right way of 

39
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,571
conceptualizing it because I think if 
you say things that are as true as you 

40
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:12,360
can say them,
let's say,

41
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,050
then they come up,
they come out of the depths inside of 

42
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,530
you because we don't know where thoughts
come from.

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,190
We don't know how far down into your 
substructure,

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,440
the thoughts he merged.
We don't know what processes have 

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,020
physiological alignment are necessary 
for you to speak from the core of your 

46
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,140
being.
We don't understand any of that.

47
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:33,960
We don't even conceptualize that,
but I believe that you can feel that and

48
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,030
I learned some of that from reading Carl
Rogers,

49
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:41,031
by the way,
who's a great clinician because he 

50
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:42,250
talked about mental health in part as 
the coherence between the,

51
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,860
the spiritual or the or the abstract and
the physical that the two things were 

52
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,570
aligned and there's a lot of idea of 
alignment in,

53
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,350
in psychoanalytic and clinical thinking.

54
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,130
But anyways,
I decided that I would start practicing 

55
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,630
not saying things that would make me.
And what happened was that I had to stop

56
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:04,250
saying almost everything that I was 
sick.

57
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,140
I would say 95 percent of it as a hell 
of a shock to wake up,

58
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:13,141
and I mean this was over a few months,
but it's a hell of a shock to wake up 

59
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:14,860
and realize that you're mostly dead 
wood.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,700
It's a shock,
you know,

61
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,490
and you might think,
well,

62
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,140
do you really want all of that to burn 
off?

63
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:20,620
It's like,
well,

64
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,150
there's nothing left,
but a little husk,

65
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,530
five percent of you.
It's like,

66
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:27,190
well,
if that five percent is solid,

67
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,310
then maybe that's exactly what you want 
to have happen.

68
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,130
Well,
so I told you that story is an 

69
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,151
elaboration of this line,
and God saw that the wickedness of man 

70
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:41,941
was great in the earth and that every 
imagine have the imagination of the 

71
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:45,031
thoughts of his heart was only evil 
continually to question worth asking 

72
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:47,470
just exactly what are your motives?

73
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,060
Well,
you know,

74
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,120
maybe they're purer than mine were and 
it's certainly possible.

75
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,510
I don't think that I'm naturally a 
particularly good person.

76
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,810
I think I have to work at it very,
very hard and I don't necessarily think 

77
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,981
that everyone is like that,
but some people are worse than that and 

78
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:11,131
everyone's like that to some degree.
So it's worth thinking about just how 

79
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:15,190
much trouble are you trying to cause,
you know,

80
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:20,191
and the other thing you might think 
about is that if you're not doing 

81
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:20,320
something important with your life by 
your own definition,

82
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,120
because that's the game that we're 
playing,

83
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:24,610
you get to define the terms at least 
initially,

84
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,390
maybe you're prone to cause trouble just
because you don't have anything better 

85
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,710
to do because at least it's trouble is 
more interesting than boring.

86
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,250
You know,
that's something you learn if you read 

87
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:38,250
Dostoevsky,
does Tsq knew that extraordinarily well.

88
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,960
And so if you're not doing something,
if you're not pushing yourself to the 

89
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,110
limits of your capacity,
then you have plenty of leftover.

90
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,420
Um,
what would you say?

91
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,680
Willpower,
energy and resources to devote,

92
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,720
causing interesting trouble.
And so while so I would say this is also

93
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:59,941
an archetypal scenario.
God saw that the wickedness of man was 

94
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:01,270
great in the earth and that every 
imagination of the thoughts of his heart

95
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:06,271
was only evil continually.
That's something to meditate on and it's

96
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:10,420
not self destructive because what it is 
is an attempt to.

97
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,630
It's like the diagnosis of an illness.
It's like if that does happen to be the 

98
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,901
case for you or to some degree,
maybe it's only 10 percent of you or 

99
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:18,970
something,
or maybe it's 90 percent,

100
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,420
well then coming to terms with that is 
excellent because then maybe you can 

101
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,500
stop doing it and what would be the 
downside to that?

102
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,310
You'd have to give up your resentment,
obviously in your hatred and all of 

103
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,310
that,
and that's really annoying because those

104
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,141
emotions are very.
They're easy to engage in in there and 

105
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:40,861
they're engaging and they have this 
feeling of self righteousness with them 

106
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:44,491
and that goes along with them.
But you're not doing this in order to 

107
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:49,681
put yourself down.
You're doing this in order to separate 

108
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:52,711
the wheat from the chaff and to leave 
everything that you don't have to be 

109
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:52,711
behind.
