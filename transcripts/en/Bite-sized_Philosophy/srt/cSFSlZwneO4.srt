1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,290
If you concentrate solely on your 
career,

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,830
you can get along way in your career,
and I would say that that's a strategy 

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,970
that a minority of men preferentially 
do,

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,310
that that's all they do.
They worked like 70,

5
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:16,400
80 hours a week.
They'd go flat out on their career.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,640
They're staking everything on the small 
probability of exceptional status in a 

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,120
narrow domain,
but it's.

8
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:25,070
It's hard on them.
They don't have a life.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,050
It's very difficult for them to have a 
family.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,140
They don't know how to take any leisure 
activity like they get very one 

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,021
dimension.
Now it may be that that unit 

12
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:36,260
dimensionality is the price you have to 
pay to be exceptional at one thing,

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,710
right?
Because if you're going to be something 

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:41,710
like a genius level mathematician and 
you want to do that for,

15
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,750
or a scientists say,
it's like you're in your lab,

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,160
you're in your lab all the time.

17
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,560
You're working 70 hours a week or 80 
hours a week,

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,390
you're smart,
you're dedicated,

19
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:55,391
you're unit dimensional,
and that's how you get to beat all the 

20
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:56,360
other people who are doing that.
It's the only way,

21
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,000
but the problem is you don't get a life.
Now,

22
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:04,001
if you love being a scientist and you 
have that kind of focus of mind,

23
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,550
well first of all,
you're a rare person and second you're 

24
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:09,550
going to pay for it,
but fine.

25
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,160
More power to you,
but,

26
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,800
but it's,
uh,

27
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,210
it's a risky business to do that.
You sacrifice a lot for it.

28
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,570
You know,
and I would say most often if you're 

29
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,960
speaking about having a healthy life,
that isn't what you do.

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,360
You spread yourself out more.
So you know,

31
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:29,240
you have a family,
you have some things that you do outside

32
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:31,360
of work that are meaningful to you and 
useful.

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,860
You,
you have a network of friends,

34
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,530
um,
that,

35
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,620
that,
those three things,

36
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:38,630
a loaner for things,
a loner,

37
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,930
plenty to keep you well oriented.
And then if one of those things 

38
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:43,930
collapses,
you know,

39
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,080
everything doesn't go now.
The price you pay for that is,

40
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,020
the more you strive to optimize that 
balance,

41
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,260
the less likely you are to be 
fantastically successful at any single 

42
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,780
one of them.
But you might have a very,

43
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,720
you know,
if you consider your life as a whole,

44
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,230
that might be a winning strategy.
One of the things,

45
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:04,100
Carl Young,
sad,

46
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,130
I really liked this.
He thought that men went after 

47
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,750
perfection and when women went after 
wholeness,

48
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,600
so there are different,
there are different value there.

49
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,760
They're different.
There's something different at the top 

50
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,590
of the value hierarchy.
So perfection would be steak,

51
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:24,200
it all in one thing and look for radical
success.

52
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,250
Not all,
not that all men do that because they 

53
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,001
don't.
But we're talking about extremes at 

54
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:31,190
least with regards to the men that do 
that.

55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,320
The wholeness ideas more like,
well,

56
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,980
I want,
I want.

57
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,330
It's like I want one thing in my life to
be 150 percent or I want five things in 

58
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:42,750
my life to be 80 percent.

59
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Well there,
there's a lot more richness in a life 

60
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,080
where you have five things operating at 
80 percent,

61
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:53,470
but you're not operating in any at any 
of them at 150 percent.

62
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:59,010
So,
and I really believe this because I've 

63
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,201
watched men and women go through their 
careers now for a long period time and 

64
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:03,910
one of the things that there's lots of 
things that produce this,

65
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,960
but one of the things that I've noticed 
is that mostly women in their thirties 

66
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,900
bear bail out of unidimensional 
dimensional careers.

67
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,330
They won't do them.
They won't.

68
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,390
They won't put it in the 80 hours a week
that they would have to put in in order 

69
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,800
to dominate that particular area.
And it isn't.

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,920
The reason that they won't do it is 
because they decide it's not worth it 

71
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,640
and no wonder because why would that be 
worth it?

72
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,530
You have to ask yourself that.

73
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,640
It's like,
well,

74
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,230
you want to be an outstanding 
scientists.

75
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,980
Like,
okay,

76
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,780
really,
really,

77
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:39,781
that's what you want because that means 
that's what you do because you're 

78
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:41,050
competing with other people.
You know,

79
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,490
they're smart,
they're hardworking,

80
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:47,491
and if you want to be at the top,
you have to be smarter and work harder 

81
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:50,821
than any of them.
And working hard means working long 

82
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:50,821
hours.
I mean,

83
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:53,560
it also means working diligently,
but in in the final analysis,

84
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:58,561
it's also an additive issue.
If I'm smart and hard working and I can 

85
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:01,000
crank out for 70 hours a week and you do
it for 30,

86
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,490
it's like in two years,
I'm so far ahead of you.

87
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:08,200
You will never ever catch up.
So anyways.

88
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,500
And I think partly maybe part of the 
reason too that women are oriented that 

89
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,711
way more than men.
I think there's two reasons is one is 

90
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:17,920
socioeconomic status does not make women
more attractive on the mating market,

91
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:19,540
but it does make men more attractive.

92
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,240
And the second is women's timeframe is 
compressed,

93
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,250
right?
Because guys can always say,

94
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:27,160
well I'll have kids later and they can 
say that until they're like 80.

95
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,660
Whereas women,
it's like,

96
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,850
no way man.
You gotta get you gotta get it together.

97
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:32,410
By the time you're,
let's say 40,

98
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:37,411
but really probably by 35,
but definitely by 40 because otherwise 

99
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,130
it ain't happening and that's bloody 
dreadful.

100
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,860
Like the most unhappy people you ever 
see.

101
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,130
No,
no.

102
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,970
One of the common roots to extreme 
unhappiness is to want children and not 

103
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,580
have the.
I wouldn't recommend that.

104
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,180
You know,
you see couples who were in their 

105
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,561
thirties,
one couple in three over the age of 30 

106
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:01,201
has fertility problems that's defined as
an inability to conceive after one year 

107
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:05,371
of trying one in three.
So it's worth thinking about because 

108
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,070
people are very,
very unhappy.

109
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:07,810
If they want to have kids and then they 
can't,

110
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,000
man,
you're in the medical mill for 10 years.

111
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,770
If that's,
if that's what happens to you.
