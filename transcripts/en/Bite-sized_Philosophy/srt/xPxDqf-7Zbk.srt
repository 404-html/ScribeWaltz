1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,040
You've said that a marriage must be 
based on trust and transparency and 

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,161
being shackled together.
How and for how long should you get to 

3
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:09,130
know someone?
How does set a foundation?

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,030
Oh,
well,

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,380
you know,
there's no,

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,720
there's no simple answer to that.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,550
Um,
hello.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,850
I think that you should know someone 
well enough so that you can so that you 

9
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:35,121
know if you can negotiate with them and 
so that you have started to formulate a 

10
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:40,311
vision of your joint future that you can
both look forward to with enthusiasm and

11
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,510
confidence.
So,

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,320
and of course that's going to depend to 
some degree on your level of maturity,

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,350
but that means you've considered such 
things as do you have a sufficient 

14
00:00:55,891 --> 00:01:00,891
number of joint interests and are you 
oriented in the same direction with 

15
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:04,521
regards to how you're going to handle 
your joint careers and the possibility 

16
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:08,421
of children and that the manner in which
you're going to interact with your in 

17
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:10,050
laws and you have to start thinking 
about.

18
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,640
You have to start

19
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,470
considering your life together from the 
perspective of practicality and 

20
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:18,840
economics,
I would say,

21
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,110
so.
It can't just be that massive erotic 

22
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,740
attraction that's associated with with 
love,

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,980
although I think that's extraordinarily 
important and you're unbelievably 

24
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,680
fortunate if you have that and you 
should do everything you can to maintain

25
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:33,480
it,
which and that takes effort.

26
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,510
That takes real effort at will,
but you need to ally that with with 

27
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,760
maturity and intelligence and maturity 
and intelligence is okay,

28
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:43,260
we're gonna,
put our lives together.

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,350
What's that going to look like at the 
level of detail?

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,320
How are we going to handle our finances?
Where are we going to live?

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,560
What are our joint plans going to be?
It's et cetera.

32
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,740
One of the things that my business 
partners and I plan to do in,

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,200
in,
what would you say that in as an analog 

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,881
to the self authoring suite is that we 
want to develop an online program to 

35
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:12,111
help people negotiate their 
relationships and and so it would 

36
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:15,390
actually provide an answer to this 
question in a more comprehensive manner,

37
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,290
is that imagine that if you want to set 
up a household with someone,

38
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,770
then there's a lot of things that you 
need to get straight and you either do 

39
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,290
that by bringing your unconscious 
assumptions to bear on the situation and

40
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:33,291
perhaps clashing where they don't match 
or you sit down like a conscious and 

41
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:39,381
aware and articulate couple and start to
negotiate what your joint 

42
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:40,200
responsibilities are going to be.

43
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,520
And so that would be well,

44
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,460
um,

45
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,480
who's responsible for the meals and when
and what are you going to eat and who's 

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,901
going to get groceries and who's going 
to pay the bills and who's going to do 

47
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:53,320
which part of what household chores 
there are to do.

48
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:55,480
And how is that going to be laid out?
Fair.

49
00:02:55,481 --> 00:03:00,481
And so you should get to know,
you should get to know the person that 

50
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:05,581
you're with well enough so that you can 
start discussing the real practical 

51
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:10,411
issues of life and determine whether or 
not you're capable of of negotiating 

52
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,090
that.
And I don't think that necessarily means

53
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:18,070
that you should live together because 
the evidence is actually quite strong.

54
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,180
At least the last time I looked at 
people who live together are more rather

55
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:25,030
than less likely to be divorced.
Now that might be.

56
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,730
That might have nothing to do with the 
actual act of living together.

57
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,180
It might be that people who are more 
likely to get divorced or also those who

58
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:36,181
are more likely to merely live together.
But I don't think that's a great 

59
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:37,600
solution for reasons I won't get to go 
get into now.

60
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,780
And with regards to being shackled 
together is that.

61
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,850
That's a complicated one.
And,

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,880
and I learned this,
at least in part from reading Carl Jung 

63
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,431
and the idea there is that unless you've
really made a commitment to someone like

64
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:54,940
a lifetime commitment and that that's a 
serious commitment,

65
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:56,710
one that you're not going to back out 
of.

66
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,280
You're not going to take the 
relationship with the seriousness that's

67
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:05,281
necessary to make it have the highest 
possible quality and sustainability 

68
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:09,661
across the course of your life.
And it's really important that it is of 

69
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:11,020
that high quality and sustainability.
Because the relationship,

70
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,300
especially when it starts to produce 
children,

71
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,080
is a.

72
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,160
A machine.
Let's say a machine that you jointly 

73
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,721
operate that adds immensely to the 
quality of your life and the depth of 

74
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:22,400
your life.
I mean you.

75
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,040
You have the rope and strand of your 
life and your partner has the strands in

76
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,640
the rope of his or her life.
And then those are tied together to make

77
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:34,240
a stronger rope.
And then that unites you across time.

78
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:37,330
And then you undertake massive 
adventures together.

79
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:42,331
And some of that is the establishment of
a household and the establishment of 

80
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:45,931
joint careers and the maintenance of 
each other's mental and physical health 

81
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:47,950
and the maintenance of a high quality 
sexual life and all of that very,

82
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:52,951
very challenging to do all of that.
And then the joint production and,

83
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,910
and care of children,
which,

84
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,120
which sets you up properly for the last 
half of your life.

85
00:04:58,121 --> 00:04:59,470
So like,
I'm 55 now,

86
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:00,880
you know,
and um,

87
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,730
both my kids just got engaged in the 
last month,

88
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,440
so that's pretty bloody amazing.

89
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,100
And they're both setting up households 
and um,

90
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,550
and there are stepping into adulthood 
and I'm fortunate enough to have them in

91
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:14,890
the city that I live in.
So Hooray for me,

92
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:18,100
that's so bloody a fortunate that I can 
hardly believe it.

93
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:23,101
I mean,
we've helped them out and tried to make 

94
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:23,101
it,
um,

95
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:26,670
what would you say to make the 
possibility of their living here be 

96
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,390
something that's viable?
But I'm absolutely thrilled that they're

97
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:33,391
going to be around and I'm looking 
forward immensely to having 

98
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:36,571
grandchildren and like,
what else are you going to do when 

99
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:36,580
you're 55?
You know,

100
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,490
when you're going to be 55,
it's going to,

101
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,530
I already have 40 more years,
like what am I going to do with those 

102
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:43,530
years?
Well,

103
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,740
so I have a good marriage.
Thank God for that.

104
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:48,460
And that's partly due to the outstanding
moral quality of my life,

105
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,520
my wife,
who I'm also extraordinarily attracted 

106
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:53,520
to.

107
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:53,520
And uh,
you know,

108
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,841
we've built a life together and we've 
had kids together and we're happy with 

109
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:59,810
our kids and we had plenty of,
of struggle with our kids because one of

110
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:02,060
our children,
my daughter had serious,

111
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:07,061
serious health problems,
which she seems to have managed to 

112
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:08,960
resolve partly as a consequence of our 
own brilliance.

113
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,570
Um,
but you know,

114
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:16,571
we've set ourselves up now so that our 
children are respectable and mature 

115
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:17,750
young adults.
So thank God for that.

116
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,080
And they've got partners who we both 
really like and they're gonna have 

117
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,810
children and well,
Hooray.

118
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:28,811
You know,
that means that this next part of my 

119
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:28,811
life is going to be something that I can
advance into with a,

120
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,930
with a fair bit of hope and,
and,

121
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,150
and excitement.
And the idea of having little kids 

122
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,260
around again is thrilling because I 
really liked little kids.

123
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:37,730
They're really,
really fun.

124
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,350
And so there's the shackled together is 
more like it's a,

125
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,330
it's,
it's,

126
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,410
it's such a.
I may have even said that,

127
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:47,210
but it's such a cynical way of looking 
at it.

128
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:52,211
It's more like what you've produced is 
an unbreakable bond between two beings 

129
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,750
and that that makes both of them,
both of them better in every way.

130
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:01,751
If it's based on if it's a relationship 
that's based on trust and genuine 

131
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:04,280
communication at a very difficult thing 
to attain because you have to be willing

132
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:09,281
to tell the truth.
And the truth is generally a horrible 

133
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:09,281
thing.
You know?

134
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:13,451
I mean,
it's easy to tell truth when everyone 

135
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:15,701
wants to hear what you have to say,
but it's very difficult to tell the 

136
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,370
truth when no one wants to hear it.
Least of all yourself.

137
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,810
And so marriage gets a very bad rap in 
our culture and Sodas,

138
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,010
child rearing.

139
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:27,010
And I think that's absolute catastrophe 
because really being in a longterm 

140
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,030
relationship,
a marriage,

141
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,310
let's say,
and having children,

142
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:36,311
that's two thirds of your life,
even if you're a highly career oriented 

143
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:40,331
person that's two thirds of your life 
and I'm a highly career oriented person 

144
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:44,620
and my family has been unbelievably 
important to me and has also been 

145
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,090
something that's enabled me to be a very
effective in my career.

146
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,420
Because my house has been a sanctuary 
for me and thank God for that.

147
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:52,460
Especially over on many times in my 
life,

148
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:57,050
but especially over the last year.
So you should.

149

relationship is the fact that you can

tell each other the truth and negotiate.
