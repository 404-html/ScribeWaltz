1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,070
What kind of relationship do you have 
with your father,

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,710
your real father?
So often ambivalent,

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,900
right?
Because the earth,

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,890
there's an element of him that 
encouraged you,

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,010
hopefully because without the 
encouragement of your father,

6
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,080
man,
the world is at dismal place.

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,290
It's very difficult to be a courageous 
person unless you have your father in 

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,730
body and spirit behind you.
It's very dear,

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,760
demoralizing,
like it really kills people not to have 

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,400
their mother.
They just don't recover from that,

11
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,790
but and I think people can recover from 
a fragmented father relationship,

12
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:38,341
but it's the next worst thing you know,
because if your father rejects you or 

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,480
doesn't form a relationship with you,
it says,

14
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:45,481
if the spirit of civilization has left 
you outside the walls as of little 

15
00:00:46,121 --> 00:00:51,121
worth,
it's very difficult for people to 

16
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:53,191
recover from that.
So the father should be an encouraging 

17
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:53,920
forest but can be a tyrannical and 
crushing for us.

18
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:58,921
And so that's very.
That's a very difficult thing to get 

19
00:00:58,921 --> 00:00:58,921
right?
Partly because

20
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,130
if you're my son,
then I should impose the highest 

21
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,851
standards of behavior on you and I 
should always be judging what you're 

22
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:10,720
doing.
Why should it be judging it with,

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,200
with the aim of making the best in you 
come forward,

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,680
but,
but getting that balance exactly right 

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,561
is very difficult and so it's easy to,
for a father to swing too much into 

26
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:23,560
judgment,
let's say.

27
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,660
And then of course mothers can play this
role to,

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,840
to swing too far into the domain of 
judgment and to be too harsh and to the 

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,650
degree that the father has his own path 
ologies,

30
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:34,570
he's going to do that in perfectly.
You know,

31
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:39,571
he might be someone who's,
who's the father who devours his son 

32
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:42,040
because he's jealous of the new 
possibility,

33
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,710
that new potential that the struggle 
for,

34
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,680
for,
uh,

35
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,030
attention and love from the mother or 
from the other children in the family.

36
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:51,280
There's all sorts of things that can go 
terribly wrong.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,360
So that's the farther as wise king.
And that's another symbol that's been 

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,321
lost,
I would say to a massive degree in 

39
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:04,661
modern universities because all we're 
taught is to tear that down and to not 

40
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:07,550
even notice that it manifests itself 
everywhere.

41
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:12,551
Especially in the universities which are
like there is close to an ideal 

42
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:16,151
environment as you could,
as human beings have ever been able to 

43
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:18,881
create.
It's as simple as that and if you can't 

44
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:19,790
be grateful for,
for the structure of the university with

45
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:24,791
all its imperfections,
then then you're completely blind to 

46
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:24,791
this element of the archetypes

47
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,510
and that's the opposite of it.
That's the sun that devours the king,

48
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:32,270
that devours his own son.
That's a tyrant.

49
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,770
You know?
That's like the mother who too over 

50
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,631
protective.
It's the male version of that and the 

51
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:40,700
mother that's too over protective says,
I'll never let anything happen to you.

52
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,020
It's like,
well,

53
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:44,270
maybe you actually want to have 
something happen to you.

54
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,510
You know,
it's a bit of an all inclusive 

55
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:49,510
statement.
It's like,

56
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,990
no,
I'm going to make you strong so any 

57
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:52,990
number of things can happen to you and 
when you're,

58
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,040
when you need some care,
I'll be there.

59
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,260
But otherwise,
like out into the world with you,

60
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,120
that's the right attitude for the 
father.

61
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,710
Like get bloody act together,
but I'm on your side.

62
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:06,640
It's because not because I want to 
destroy you or demeaning you or push you

63
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:09,080
down in the dominance hierarchy,
but because I want the best,

64
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:12,160
didn't you to emerge and so are you need
standards.

65
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,350
It's like,
what are you doing wasting your life?

66
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:18,640
There's way more than that to you get 
your act together and bring it out.

67
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,880
And that's a message that people really 
want to hear if they have any sense at 

68
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:23,880
all and generally they do want to hear 
it.

69
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,340
So,
you know,

70
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,780
I was talking,
I've been talking to a lot of people 

71
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:32,780
recently as,
as perhaps you know,

72
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,861
and what I was talking to one of the 
leaders of the Conservatives this 

73
00:03:36,861 --> 00:03:39,950
morning and they're asking me about the 
person who's asking me about bill see 

74
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,720
16,
but more specifically about talking to 

75
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,601
young people in.
Because the conservative leadership 

76
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:49,090
struggle is going on right now.
I've been talking to a bunch of them and

77
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:49,800
I said,
well look,

78
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:53,280
one of the things you could do for young
people that no one's doing is to talk to

79
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:58,281
them about responsibility because 
everyone talks to young people about 

80
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:58,281
rights.

81
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,180
So like,
we need our rights.

82
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:01,290
It's like,
Oh God,

83
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,600
how many rights do you need?
You know,

84
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:08,601
really,
like you have more privileges than any 

85
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:08,670
people who've ever lived anywhere.
Well,

86
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:12,030
it's so dull to hear that so dull.
It's so pathetic.

87
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:13,260
And,
and uh,

88
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,530
what would you call it?
It's so demeaning that you have to be 

89
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,230
protected and have your rights.
It's like I said,

90
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:21,960
there's a huge marketplace for 
responsibility.

91
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,820
That's what you want to talk to young 
people about.

92
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:27,600
It's like get your act together and do 
something worthwhile with your life.

93
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,270
For the first time,
my entire adult life,

94
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:33,120
the conservatives actually have 
something to sell young people,

95
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:35,550
right?
They could sell them responsibility.

96
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,630
It's like,
well,

97
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:38,880
why?
Because that's where my life has meaning

98
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:42,600
with responsibility.
The more responsibility you take on,

99
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:47,601
the more meaning your life has and the,
the higher degree of responsibility that

100
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:52,791
you agreed voluntarily to try to bear,
the richer your life will be.

101
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,950
And no one's ever told that.
And it's the case,

102
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,420
you know,
it's like you have,

103
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,490
you have four kids say,
well,

104
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:02,430
that's plenty of responsibility.
You're going to have meaning.

105
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,170
It's going to be rough,
you know,

106
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,200
because it's complicated.
You have a complicated job and you try 

107
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
to help the careers of the people well 
around you.

108
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,160
Do you try to solve tough problems and 
aimed suffering and do all of that.

109
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:17,070
It's like its weight,
its responsive stability,

110
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:18,870
but it's,
there's glory in it.

111
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:21,540
There's real glory in it.
There's deep meaning in it and,

112
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,980
and,
and young people are starving for that 

113
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,021
because no one ever tells them that.
It's like you're way more than you 

114
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:30,021
think,
man,

115
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:31,470
stand up.
Do something difficult.

116
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,290
Doing something difficult and heroic,
right?

117
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,110
Burst out of your borns.
So like,

118
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,950
that's a good message.
That's a necessary message because we 

119
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,790
have to be more than we are because if 
we,

120
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,860
if we aren't,
we're not going to survive.
