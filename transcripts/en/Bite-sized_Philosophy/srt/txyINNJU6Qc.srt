1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,280
Couple of questions about dialogue and 
engaging in dialogue with people.

2
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:10,281
So the first issue that I faced is a,
I have a very high need for intellectual

3
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:14,310
stimulation and I can't get that with 
most people.

4
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:18,540
It's something like you can,
you can have a dialogue for a time,

5
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,630
but then it

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,500
titrate openness

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,170
and,
and that.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,300
But then they started running out of 
ideas they can keep up and it sort of 

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,580
falls apart and okay,
this is a problem that intellectuals 

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,150
have quite frequently is that they,
they sort of,

11
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:36,520
once they started getting difficult and 
rewarding stuff,

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,970
they stop wanting to talk to regular 
people and I think that contributes to 

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,651
the disconnect that you see between the 
intellectuals and working class people 

14
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:49,000
and stuff like that.
And the other question I had was about,

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,580
okay,
wait,

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,050
I don't know if that's the question.
I believe there's a question in there.

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,770
The question is how,
how do you,

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,740
how should we address that?
How should I address it?

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,710
And uh,
is that something that can be dressed?

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,350
Well,
part of,

21
00:01:02,351 --> 00:01:05,170
part of the answer to that is that's 
what the universities were for.

22
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,490
I mean,
you know,

23
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:11,491
not everybody is equipped to or 
interested in engaging in high level 

24
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:14,080
discussion of abstract and creative 
ideas.

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,260
You know,
you hear this idea that everyone's 

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,260
creative.
That's a lie.

27
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,500
It's a straightforward,
is that true?

28
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:23,650
Creativity is very,
very rare and so,

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,800
and if you happen to be a creative 
person or if you happen to be someone 

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,750
who's profoundly interested in ideas,
you are in a pronounced minority just as

31
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:36,751
you are,
if you happen to be extremely 

32
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:36,751
extroverted or extremely agreeable,
are extremely conscientious.

33
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,470
These are minority issues and what you 
do is you find likeminded people who are

34
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:46,471
capable of engaging that we know a 
heavyweight heavyweight weightlifters 

35
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,930
compete with heavyweight weightlifters 
for a reason and everyone thinks that's 

36
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,490
fine and the same thing applies to 
intellectual and creative endeavors.

37
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,260
So what you do is you try to find a 
community where that's,

38
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:05,580
that's the nature of the community and 
you likely have to find a relationship 

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,710
like that as well.
So I don't think so.

40
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:13,711
I think what contributes to the siloing 
is the arrogance that goes along with 

41
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:13,711
it.
Because if you're,

42
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,680
you can be interested in ideas and you 
can be creative.

43
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,990
Well that's the arrogance of the 
intellect,

44
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:21,670
right?
That's the thing the Catholic Church had

45
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:24,250
warned about for centuries is the 
arrogance of the intellect.

46
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,700
So because if you're,
if you're wise as well as smart and 

47
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,120
there is no relationship between being 
smart and being wise,

48
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:36,121
they are not the same thing.
There is no quick pathway from smart to 

49
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:39,841
wise.
And many of the people who I've known 

50
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:42,631
who were very wise were,
some of them were intellectually 

51
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:43,020
impaired and we're still wise,
you know,

52
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,270
so it's the arrogance that brings up the
block.

53
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,800
And I see this,
for example,

54
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:52,801
happening in the United States in 
particular because the last time I went 

55
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:52,801
down there,
for example,

56
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:57,151
I was,
I had friends down there and some of 

57
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:59,821
those friends are very,
very smart people and some of them were 

58
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:02,941
talking about the voters and they were 
talking about the trump voters with 

59
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:07,321
contempt and I thought you better watch 
that because that's 50 percent of the 

60
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:12,031
dam population and it might be 
convenient to think that they're stupid 

61
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:16,111
and beneath you,
but it's not conducive to a civil state 

62
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:19,680
and there's no evidence that it's true 
because there isn't a straight line 

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,810
between intelligent and wise.
And so I think that if your,

64
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,650
if your character is developed and 
you're intelligent,

65
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,860
you can have your siloed,
creative community,

66
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,250
but you develop enough wisdom so that 
you can see all the things that people 

67
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,941
can do that or have high ethical utility
that are outside the intellectual 

68
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:38,941
domain.

69
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,330
You know?
And I think that's why in the New 

70
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,680
Testament,
I think that's why Christ is a 

71
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:46,680
carpenter,
right?

72
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:46,680
Because,
well,

73
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,370
first of all,
carpenter is one of those jobs that when

74
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:56,371
you're dishonest,
it manifests itself immediately because 

75
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:57,160
what you build falls down,
and so if you're an honest carpenter,

76
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,620
you build a good house.
So there's a nice metaphor there,

77
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:04,621
but it's also.
It's also a warning in some sense 

78
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:08,880
against the the equation of intellectual
brilliance with moral superiority.

79
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,620
And so if the intellects would drop 
their moral superiority and fat chance 

80
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,881
there is of that,
then that divide between the working 

81
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:24,661
class say and the elite would would 
resolve.

82
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,700
And there's every reason to have respect
for decent working class people.

83
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,300
I mean it's on their labor as the left 
wingers at least hypothetically agree 

84
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,360
that the entire edifice of the culture 
is,

85
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,890
is resting so you can have your cake and
eat it too.

86
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,890
But you have to not assume that your 
niche makes you superior.

87
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,990
And it's very difficult for smart 
people,

88
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,990
especially smart.
There's this scene in niches.

89
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,410
Sins thus spake Zarathustra were zero.
Booster of the profit comes down from 

90
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,701
the mountain and he comes into a public 
square and there's this crowd around 

91
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:06,820
this little midget who is only about 
this high,

92
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:11,821
who has a gigantic ear and everyone is 
marveling at him.

93
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,460
Well,
that's what the modern intellect is 

94
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:17,460
like.
It's a midget with a giant.

95
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,410
Well mouth generally not an ear and the 
the,

96
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,470
the being is underdeveloped,
but the intellect is hyper activated and

97
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,910
it makes the person extraordinarily 
unbalanced and it's partly because a,

98
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,050
they can't compete outside of the 
intellectual realm and that makes them 

99
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,050
very bitter because they tend to think,
well,

100
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,600
God,
I'm so smart.

101
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,010
Everything should just come to me.
It's like,

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,660
sorry,
that's not how the world works.

103
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,050
And,
and it also that,

104
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,750
that and that,
that,

105
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,410
that attitude is immediately evident to 
people that they're talking to when they

106
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:52,411
talk in the manner that they talk,
if they are arrogant intellectuals of 

107
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:55,471
that sort.
You see that in the simpsons did a good 

108
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:55,820
job of that with Comic Book Guy,
right?

109
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,840
I mean,
he completely useless in every possible 

110
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,200
dimension with an Iq of about 160 and 
it's very annoying to people who have an

111
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:06,170
Iq of 160 that they can also be 
completely useless,

112
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,580
but it happens a lot.
So yeah.

113
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,260
Thanks.
