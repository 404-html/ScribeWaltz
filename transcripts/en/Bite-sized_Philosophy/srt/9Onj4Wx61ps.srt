1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,100
And then when the Marxist say,
well,

2
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:04,980
that wasn't real Marxism,
what it really means,

3
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:06,660
and I've thought about this for a long 
time,

4
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:10,200
it's the most arrogant possible 
statement anyone could ever make.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,380
It means if I would have been in 
Stalin's position,

6
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:18,381
I would have ushered in the damn utopia 
instead that instead of the genocidal 

7
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:22,470
massacres,
because I understand the doctrine of 

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,970
Marxism and everything about me is good.
It's like,

9
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,680
well,
think again sunshine.

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,950
You don't understand it,
you don't understand it and you're not 

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,430
that good.
And if the power was in your hands,

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,460
assuming you had the competence,
which you don't,

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,180
you wouldn't have done any better.
And even if you had,

14
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:44,181
there would have been someone else 
waiting right behind you to shoot you 

15
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:45,150
the first time you actually tried to do 
anything good.

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,750
And that's what happened to all the old 
guard who ran the damn revolution.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,960
Stalin rounded them all up and shot them
along with their families and millions 

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,191
of other people.
So even if you do happen to be that 

19
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,850
Avatar of moral purity that you claim 
implicitly,

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,120
the probability that you get to act out 
your goodness in relationship to those 

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,020
possessed by Your radiology is zero.
