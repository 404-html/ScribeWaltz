1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,170
The snake in the garden of Eden is a 
really interesting character.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,450
Human beings and their closest 
biological relative chimpanzees are 

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,780
innately afraid of and attracted to 
reptiles.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,810
They automatically trigger off responses
in a part of the brain called the 

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,261
Amygdala that's associated with anxiety 
and I think the evolutionary reason for 

6
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:25,551
this is that mammals and reptiles have 
been at war in a sense over ecological 

7
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:31,500
turf for something between $60,
million and 200 million years.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,130
Reptilian features which are cold 
blooded,

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,840
a piercing I'd tooth lurking,
nocturnal out there,

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,720
out in the unknown.
Outward chaos is the snake is 

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,440
representative of the unknown in a 
sense,

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,740
and it's an ambivalent feature and you 
see that you see that even in its used 

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,450
in mythology because for example,
the dragon in in,

14
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:58,530
in western culture is a negative 
feature,

15
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:01,290
but in Chinese culture it's positive 
feature.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,330
So the unknown is like that.

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,330
It's positive and negative.
The snake in the garden of Eden is 

18
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,810
representative of all those things that 
lurk.

19
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,990
When you think you know what you're 
doing and when you think you know what 

20
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,090
you're doing,
you've carved out this little.

21
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,460
Eden has little paradise in which you're
operating,

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,940
but there's always something that's 
lurking and that's all the things you're

23
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:22,380
not paying attention to.
Well,

24
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:24,870
that's the snake and we're not snake 
pops up.

25
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,700
People are.
We're wired.

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,520
If a little snake pops out,
we might want to run away from it,

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,980
but like we're curious about that.
We're going to go over there and 

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:34,980
investigate right away.
Now,

29
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,170
when chimps come across a python in the 
forest,

30
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,560
they have a specific cry.
It's called a snake wrath,

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,040
and the chimps who don't like snakes,
they don't run from it.

32
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,290
They back off and then they watched the 
thing.

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,500
They cannot tear their eyes away from it
and some of the most stand there and 

34
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,671
look at it for 10 minutes.
Other individuals will stand there for 

35
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:56,730
hours watching the snake.
The unknown is fascinating.

36
00:01:56,731 --> 00:02:01,731
We can't look away from it.
We have to encounter it even if it's 

37
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:01,731
terrifying.
It's partly why,

38
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:03,240
you know,
teenagers like horror movies,

39
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,690
they're driven to look at the snake.
They're are driven to interact with the 

40
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,900
snake.
In Genesis,

41
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:13,500
of course,
interacting with the snake means the end

42
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,750
of paradise.
Just like it does in life,

43
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,900
there are ideas that the serpent in the 
garden of Eden was Satan and trying to 

44
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,460
destroy God's handiwork.
People often look back in their lives 

45
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:25,460
and they say,
well,

46
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,051
you know,
I got knocked out of my little paradise 

47
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:30,051
by,
you know,

48
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:32,841
this particular event,
but looking back on it really made me 

49
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:32,841
grow up.
It really made me mature.

50
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:35,220
Whatever it is,
that's the serpent in the garden of Eden

51
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,650
certainly plays that role.
It's a catalyst.

52
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,270
Much of what's unknown is redemptive.
Much of what's unknown gives life saver.

53
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:42,900
It,
it,

54
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,260
it provides the kind of excitement that 
justifies suffering.

55
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,680
The injunction behind religious thought 
fundamentally is that you should live 

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,331
your life in such a way that the 
suffering it has to contain because 

57
00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:57,690
you're confined and vulnerable is 
justified.
