1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,660
That his brother and went to feed their 
father's flock and check him.

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:05,910
So they took off and Israel said unto 
Joseph,

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,780
do you know what my brother and feed the
flock and check him calm and I will send

4
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:14,781
thee unto him.
And he said to him and he said to him 

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:14,781
here,
here tomorrow.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,570
And when they saw him afar off,
even before he came near onto them,

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,780
they conspired against him to slay him.
Rough people back then,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,900
right?
This is,

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,540
this sort of thing is happening quite 
frequently.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,180
And they said to one another,
behold the dreamer cometh.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,020
Come now therefore let us slay him,
cast him into some pit and we will say 

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,990
some evil beast has devoured him and we 
shall see what becomes of his dreams.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,450
So there's an echo of the Cain and Abel 
story there.

14
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:46,680
Obviously,
you know what I mean?

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,220
It's not quite as clear because indicate
enables store able is clearly just doing

16
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:56,370
well.
And here you can't quite get a handle on

17
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:01,371
Joseph's character.
You can't tell if he is actually the 

18
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:02,190
elect or if he's just a spoiled Brat 
with delusions of grandeur,

19
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,240
you know?
And,

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,930
but it doesn't matter because his 
brothers,

21
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:11,931
they're so irritated at his,
the fact that he's favored and perhaps 

22
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:16,101
even the fact that he might be someone 
destined for for something special,

23
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,220
that they find it perfectly reasonable 
to destroy that and it's so hard.

24
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:28,221
It's so interesting how often that motif
of pulling down in ideal manifest itself

25
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:31,200
in these old stories,
right?

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,560
It's,
it's the pattern is established in the 

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,721
Cain and Abel Story.
It just repeats and repeats and repeats 

28
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:41,481
and I think that's dead true.
I think it just repeats all the time so 

29
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:43,290
that people are annoyed about how tragic
their lives are.

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,680
They're annoyed that they're subject to 
malevolence and they're annoyed that 

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,130
they're not doing as well as other 
people are doing and that makes them up,

32
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,180
puts them exactly into this state of 
mind.

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,520
Now,
maybe with modern people,

34
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,150
if you're going to kill someone because 
you're resentful as a modern person,

35
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,700
you don't generally slay them and throw 
them into a pit.

36
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,030
You know what you do is you just killed 
them slowly over a few decades and it 

37
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,450
isn't obvious to me that that's any 
better.

38
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,900
So I've seen plenty of married couples 
who were in that situation.

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,070
It's like,
it's like there is this Mitch Hedberg,

40
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,190
he used to complain about turtleneck 
phase.

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,240
It was like being strangled by a really 
weak midget and it's probably really 

42
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:32,160
politically incorrect joke,
but it's a funny joke.

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,830
So,
uh,

44
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,980
and then you see,
you see relationships that are like 

45
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,001
that.
It's like each person has their hands 

46
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:46,281
around the neck of the other person,
but they don't have enough courage to 

47
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:48,981
actually to squeeze it,
just put enough pressure on to cut the 

48
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:53,631
circulation off a tiny bit.
So the person just gets like a die over 

49
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,410
a 30 year period,
something like that.

50
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,150
So yeah,
and you all laugh because you know,

51
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:02,150
it's true.
That's why it's.
