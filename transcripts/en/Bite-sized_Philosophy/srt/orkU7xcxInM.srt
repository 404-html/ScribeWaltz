1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,170
Well,
that's the sun devouring father,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,730
that's a painting by Medina of Satan.
It's pretty horrifying one,

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,680
and that's Captain Hook.
I really liked the figure of Captain 

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,730
Hook some of these popular mythological 
stories.

5
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:22,731
Myths based fairytales.
Modern fairy tales have got things 

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:22,731
really right.
Captain Hook.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,510
Well,
he's a pirate.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,290
So I think I told you that in the Google
engineers investigations of female 

9
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:35,841
sexual fantasies,
the pirate played a large role werewolf 

10
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:39,690
vampire pirate surgeon,
billionaire credibly comic comical,

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,160
well pirate,
you know,

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,030
captain of the high seas and someone 
willing to break rules.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,140
There's a romance in that figure.
Well,

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,560
so the idea of the great father as the 
pirate is a good one.

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,860
Well,
Kirk is kind of a pathetic pirate and of

16
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:55,410
course pirates are precisely that 
because they're all crooked.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,740
And so what makes empathetic?
Well it isn't because he's got a hook 

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,150
precisely because maybe that's just a 
sign of adventure.

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,840
It's because he's being chased by a 
crocodile with a clock in its stomach.

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,390
Well,
that's the dragon of chaos right now.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,800
It's time,
tick,

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,700
tick,
tick.

23
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,390
Your life is going to end.
It's already got a piece of you and it's

24
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,480
coming for the rest,
and so the hook is terrified of that.

25
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:21,960
He's terrified into resentment and and,
and evil,

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,480
roughly speaking,
why he can prey on other people.

27
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,380
And so that's the father in the Peter 
Pan Story out in Neverland,

28
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:31,580
which is the archetypal domain captain 
Hook's the farther,

29
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,890
well,
why would peter pan want to grow up to 

30
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:36,890
be Captain Hook?
Well,

31
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,470
he doesn't,
and so he stays.

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,570
Pan.
Pan Means everything,

33
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,400
right?
Like pantheism,

34
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,250
he stays everything.
He's this divine child.

35
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:45,780
He never wants to grow up.
Well,

36
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:50,781
why would you sacrifice the potential of
youth to become nothing but a death 

37
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:52,830
obsessed tyrant?
Well,

38
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,680
that's the story in,
in Peter Pan,

39
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,830
and of course Wendy's in the story,
and so as Tinkerbell,

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,840
tinkerbell is the imagined feminine.

41
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,300
She's.
She doesn't even exist.

42
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:08,301
She's just this perfect little thing 
that's always around whenever Peter Pan 

43
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:11,961
needs her.
But the problem with Tinkerbell is that 

44
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:13,350
she's a fairy and fairies don't exist.
He has wendy there.

45
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,410
She's a real girl.
When she grows up and actually marry 

46
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,181
someone,
Peter Pan Stays King of the lost boys 

47
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:21,540
forever and you know,
maybe it's better to be king of the lost

48
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,550
boys,
but not to be king it all,

49
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:27,780
but maybe not to king of the dam does 
not exactly something to.

50
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,660
It's not a dominance hierarchy to strive
for dominating.

51
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,290
So that's the Peter Pan Story and it's a
right.

52
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,960
It's the right story for the modern age,
that's for sure.

53
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,160
So that's a negative element of the 
great father.

54
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,340
Here's the positive element of the great
father.

55
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:50,341
These are both read.
This is a representation of Moses 

56
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:51,760
receiving the the rules for living from 
God on high.

57
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,790
What we talked about that already know,
and I see that that's a story of the 

58
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,051
revelation of structure.
That's the story of we're acting out a 

59
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,380
moral structure.
Well,

60
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:07,381
what is it now?
And then we get a glimpse of what the 

61
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:09,961
moral structure isn't.
It hits people with the force of a 

62
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:09,961
revelation,
then it can be articulated,

63
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:11,750
and that's partly what the story of 
Moses lays out.

64
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,690
When you see here,
this picture,

65
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:17,510
I really liked this one too.
This is a supplicant,

66
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:21,020
basically someone who's who's hit hard 
by a divine vision.

67
00:03:21,021 --> 00:03:22,730
It's God in heaven.
Again,

68
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:25,490
very,
very similar to this with with the cross

69
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:30,491
in the background and it's something 
like that to transcend your littleness 

70
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,830
because look,
he's looking up.

71
00:03:31,831 --> 00:03:36,831
That's what's at the top of the 
dominance hierarchy is what at the top 

72
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:38,790
of all possible dominance hierarchies.
Look up.

73
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,930
That's the father who supports the 
sudden,

74
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:43,970
that's transcending his own 
vulnerability,

75
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:48,971
right?
Willing to bear it voluntarily and not 

76
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:48,971
too,
and not to shirk from that.

77
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,580
It's exactly right and it is what you 
admire in people who you admire,

78
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:56,190
people who are courageous and who were 
strong,

79
00:03:56,191 --> 00:04:01,191
and when you decompose that,
it means that they're able to act 

80
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:04,140
appropriately and in a helpful,
compassionate,

81
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:09,141
wise and tough manner.
Despite the fact that there'd be set 

82
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:11,190
with all of the problems of mortality 
than everyone else.

83
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,000
Well,
how does it go wrong?

84
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,460
Well,
that's whole propaganda for Hitler.

85
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,440
Look at the imagery.
You know,

86
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,630
he's a night that's on the right.
He's the.

87
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,680
He's the night of nationalism.
Well,

88
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:27,220
that's God the father too.
You know it's a little bit one sided,

89
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,610
right,
because there's more to the farther than

90
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:33,130
the state.
That's the thing,

91
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:36,790
and that's the problem with nationalism 
and it's totalitarian variance and we're

92
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,950
moving into that direction fast,
right?

93
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:43,951
You see Europe right now fragmenting 
again because the European Union is too 

94
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:48,571
amorphous and maybe not well enough 
bordered and everyone is getting nervous

95
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:51,100
and they're saying back to the state,
back to the state,

96
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:52,780
it's fair enough.
Fair enough.

97
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,220
You.
You need to be around people who are 

98
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,220
like you,
so to speak,

99
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,450
that you have built a consensus with,
but to subordinate yourself to the state

100
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,410
and to make its head that the bearer of 
the,

101
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,140
the,
the,

102
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,940
the archetype of the night without 
having that element of individuality and

103
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:11,470
it is absolutely pathological.

104
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,360
We've already been down that road,
right?

105
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,760
Because the national socialists were 
hyper national,

106
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:20,790
just like,
oh it both in Germany and in Italy and 

107
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,790
it's attractive.
Again,

108
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,720
it's interesting here you see Hitler as 
a night and up here there's a bird,

109
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:26,500
you know,
and that bird should be the dove because

110
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:29,080
that should be the holy ghost if the 
iconography was proper,

111
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:34,081
but it's not.
It's an eagle and an eagle is a bird of 

112
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:34,540
carrion eater,
right?

113
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,290
It feeds on corpses while it's worth 
thinking about.

114
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,770
So that's the woman worshiping the 
strong father.

115
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:43,690
Another representation of Hitler as a 
night,

116
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:45,570
and then there's Hitler as wise father 
is.

117
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:50,571
He is surrounded by people there who 
focused in on him as if he's an 

118
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:52,340
architect.
Archetype will import and then this is a

119
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,650
poster from,
from the allies,

120
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,690
Nancy Nazi poster from allies,
and you see right there that Hitler and 

121
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,510
the Nazis are assimilated to a massive 
predatory snakes.

122
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:02,990
It's like,
well,

123
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:03,650
why?
Well,

124
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,330
if you want to appeal to someone's 
determination to destroy you say,

125
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,460
well here you are in.
You're already to go.

126
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,520
Let's go kill some snakes.
And everyone can say yes,

127
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:16,250
and then you say,
well there's the snakes right there.

128
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,450
And the thing is,
it's true to some degree because you,

129
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,350
you have plenty of snakes.
Just like everyone else,

130
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,620
and so it's easy.
That's the first step towards 

131
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:26,620
demonization and you can do it just like
that.

132
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,180
It's no problem.
The archetype will map perfectly,

133
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,080
especially if there's already tension 
between the groups or if the other group

134
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:36,530
is identifiable in some manner or you 
can make it identifiable.

135
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,740
Discussed is the best way to do that,
not fear,

136
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,070
disgust,
fear to fear someone.

137
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:48,071
You have to respect them.
You don't want to burn everything that 

138
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:52,751
the person that you fear owns.
You want to burn everything that the 

139
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:55,670
person who disgusts you owns,
and so you'll see people who are pushing

140
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,390
the nationalist agenda hard and Hitler 
did this beautifully.

141
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,810
Everything that was outside of the area 
and domain of purity wasn't to be 

142
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,870
feared.
It was disgusting.

143
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,640
It was contemptuous and it should be 
destroyed and purified by fire,

144
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,910
and that was his message.
The Nazis were unbelievably great at 

145
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,330
using fire of purification as a symbolic
message.

146
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,990
Well,
it has an archetype will power.

147
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,020
Then you see here,
this is an English,

148
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,590
a poster from the World War II.
I'm asking people to buy bonds to fund 

149
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,590
the American or the British war effort,
and you see these,

150
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,890
these talon like plause Japan and Nazi 
Germany reaching out to the virgin 

151
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:43,100
mother and her infant child,
right?

152
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,110
The deep use of deep subordination,
of archetipal imagery for the purposes.

153
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,350
While I hesitate to say propaganda 
because World War II in some sense was 

154
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,460
pretty clear cut,
but you,

155
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:57,770
you get the point and there's the 
uniform reoccur.

156
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,780
That uniformity of the state,
right?

157
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,690
So the goose step,
everybody moves exactly the same way.

158
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,810
Everybody's put.
Everybody's turned into exactly the same

159
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:10,811
carbon copy of everyone else.
All the diversity is pushed out of the 

160
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:14,561
state.
It's subordinated to the supreme leader 

161
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:14,561
in the hierarchy becomes incredibly 
rigid and,

162
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,760
and,
and,

163
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,850
and,
and,

164
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,380
and,
and homogenous.

165
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,010
So like,
well,

166
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:24,011
that's great for fast action,
but it's terrible if you don't know 

167
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:24,011
where you're going,
you need some diversity,

168
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:28,841
needs some flaws in the crystalline 
structure in case you're on the wrong 

169
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,921
path.
And that's why you can't have everyone 

170
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:36,011
being the supreme leader's acolytes.
The whole bloody thing wanders off in 

171
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:40,091
one direction and because we don't know 
the right direction to go wandering off 

172
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:42,560
in a single direction is extraordinarily
dangerous.

173
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,620
You will eventually fall over a cliff,
so there's the Nazis use of of light at 

174
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:55,181
night.
There were unbelievably good out there 

175
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:57,550
at.
There is one of the things that made 

176
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:57,550
fascism so difficult to fight because 
with communism,

177
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,460
because it was a fully articulated 
philosophy,

178
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:03,180
you could attack it rationally,
but fascism never really did that.

179
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,850
What they did instead was used ritual,
right?

180
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Huge mass rallies and highly emotionally
supercharged meetings and then the use 

181
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:16,791
of light and fire and so Hitler built 
the biggest parade grounds in human 

182
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:22,071
history to host the Nuremberg rallies 
and he would get in front of them on 

183
00:09:22,071 --> 00:09:26,061
this huge stage with with Greek columns.
Very impressive looking and have blocks 

184
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:30,120
of thousands of people organized 
perfectly orderly.

185
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,330
The Germans are good at order in order 
is associated with disgust,

186
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:35,550
sensitivity,
incredibly organized,

187
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:40,551
orderly displays complete and then at 
night with fire and behind him he would 

188
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:43,740
have all of the search lights from the 
Luftwaffe,

189
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:48,120
aligned up dozens of them shooting their
light straight up miles into the sky.

190
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:51,750
So we stand in front of these incredibly
impressive displays of light.

191
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,290
Long before there were rock shows and so
forth doing that,

192
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,600
you know,
it was unparalleled in history and,

193
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,230
and addressed the crowd and it was very 
good at addressing the crowd.

194
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,470
He'd say something and if people were 
listening he'd say more of it and if 

195
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,470
they were listening you'd say more of 
it.

196
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,420
And because he was addressing the mob,
the mob God exactly from Hitler what 

197
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,290
they wanted,
and we saw what that was like,

198
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:18,291
right?
One hundred and $20 million people dead 

199
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:18,930
in no time flat and the worst horrors 
that were ever perpetrated on people.

200
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,270
Maybe because there's no shortage of 
perpetrated horrors.
