1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,920
And you know,
you go into places like that,

2
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:04,170
I always think of the archetypal diner 
in that way.

3
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,060
You know,
you guys have been in this diner,

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,360
there's a really good opposite diner and
there's a great video on youtube.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,030
It's Tom waits reading,
reading a poem by Makowsky and I think 

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,200
it's called Nirvana.
And it's about a good diner that,

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,270
that happened to visit because he 
happened to visit when he was on a bus 

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:25,440
when he was a,
when he was a kid,

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,650
a diner where everything was going well.
And you could listen to that.

10
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:29,940
It's great.
I think it's great.

11
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:32,220
But this is the opposite diner I'm 
thinking about.

12
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:33,630
So you'll go into a diner,
right?

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,900
It's 7:00
in the morning and you order some bacon 

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,231
and eggs and some toast and then you 
look around in the diner and you think 

15
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,230
it was like 1975 when the windows were 
last washed.

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,230
And there's this kind of thick coating 
of who gives a damn grease on the walls,

17
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:51,810
you know,
and,

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,950
and the floor to has got that sort of 
stickiness that you really have to work 

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,900
out to develop over years,
you know,

20
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:02,901
and the waitress is,
she's not happy to be there and the guy 

21
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:05,991
behind the counter isn't happy that,
that happens to be the waitress that 

22
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:06,000
he's working with.
And then,

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,270
you know,
you walk down the stairs maybe to the 

24
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,311
washroom and now it's its own little 
trip and so you come back and you order 

25
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:18,501
your damn eggs and you order your toast 
in the order your bacon and then it 

26
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:22,560
comes in like the eggs are too cooked on
the bottom.

27
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:27,561
So they're kind of brown and then 
they're kind of raw on top and they're 

28
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:27,970
cold in the middle,
which is,

29
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,480
you really have to work their cooking 
egg like that man.

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,840
But you can master that with like 10 
years of bitterness.

31
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:36,090
You teach you how to cook an egg like 
that.

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,460
And then the toast,
here's what you do with the toast,

33
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:39,380
right?
You put,

34
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,120
you take,
you take the white bread,

35
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:46,260
you know the precise stuff that no one 
should ever eat and then you put that in

36
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:51,261
the toaster and you overcook it and then
you wait and then you pop it out of the 

37
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:56,031
toaster and then cause it's overcooked.
You scrape it off and you knock off the 

38
00:01:56,031 --> 00:02:00,831
crumbs so it doesn't look too bird and 
then you wait till it's cold and then 

39
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:03,010
you put cold margin on it because if you
put cold march,

40
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,110
first of all,
not butter,

41
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,430
but if you put cold margarine or you can
also kind of tear holes in it so then it

42
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:13,431
has lumps of margarine in it and it's 
really dry except where it's too greasy.

43
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,960
So that's like it's own little work of 
art man.

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,420
And then you put that on the side with 
the,

45
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,470
with the,
with the eggs and then you have the 

46
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,080
potatoes and this is how you cook the 
potatoes properly.

47
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,180
So the leftover potatoes and you keep 
dumping new leftover potatoes into the 

48
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,300
old leftover potatoes over weeks.
And so some of the potatoes,

49
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:38,470
if they're no longer potatoes,
right?

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,120
They've have return to mother earth,
then you flop them on the grill and you 

51
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:50,430
sort of had to know you burned them a 
bit I guess,

52
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:53,580
and then you slap them on the plate and 
Jesus,

53
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:57,060
you don't want to eat those man.
That's for sure.

54
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:02,061
And that's the point.
And then you have the bake and then you 

55
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:04,670
want to make sure you buy the lowest 
possible quality bacon.

56
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,440
That's how I start.
And then you throw it on the grill and 

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,221
you don't.
Your grill has to be overheated to do 

58
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:17,161
this,
you have to cook the Bacon so that it's 

59
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:19,591
raw and places and burnt in other places
and it has that delightful like older.

60
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:25,321
They'd only really cheap,
badly cooked bacon can provide or maybe 

61
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:29,641
you use those little breakfast sausages 
that no one in their bloody right mind 

62
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:31,090
would let within 15 feet of anything 
living,

63
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,300
you know.
And then you serve that right and you 

64
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,181
serve it with the kind of orange juice 
that is only orange in color and,

65
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,380
and with coffee,
that's.

66
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,420
What would you say it was started too 
early in the morning.

67
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,780
That's the first thing.
Bad quality coffee started too early in 

68
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,921
the morning route.
God called once or twice and has been 

69
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:02,410
reheated,
and then you serve that with whitener.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,550
It's like,
here is your breakfast.

71
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,020
It's like,
no man,

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,600
that's not breakfast.
That's hell

73
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,290
no,

74
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,940
and and you created it and then what you
do if you have a diner like that is 

75
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,860
because you have a miserable life.
If you have a diner like that and you've

76
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:31,861
really worked on achieving that is every
night you go home and you curse your 

77
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:35,910
wife and you curse your kids and you 
fucking well curse God to for producing 

78
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:41,161
a universe where a diner like yours is 
allowed to exist and that's your bloody 

79
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:41,650
life.
