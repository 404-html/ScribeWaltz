1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,360
Have you ever had to tell someone that 
they are best suited to a subservient 

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,740
slash blue collar lifestyle because they
don't have any semblance of brilliance?

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,920
Okay.
Well I want to take issue with the 

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,721
formulation of that question.
Although I think it's a perfectly 

5
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:14,721
reasonable question.
That's Jen Swan.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,630
Don't be thinking that a blue collar 
lifestyle is necessarily subservient.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,830
I mean,
first of all,

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,860
you can be a trades person and now it's 
a really good career choice as far as 

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:24,860
I'm concerned.
It's,

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,130
it's very,
very valuable in,

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,400
you know,
good plumbers are rare and good 

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,550
carpenters are rare and good brick 
layers are rare and they're so useful.

13
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:34,140
I mean,
I do a lot of renovation work.

14
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:36,720
I've done an awful lot of renovation 
work on all the places that I've,

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,870
I've lived in and I've learned to do a 
fair bit of construction and automotive 

16
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,321
body work and all those sorts of things 
and I really liked doing it and you 

17
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:45,321
know,
there's,

18
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:50,000
they're blue collar life is not 
necessarily subservient at all because 

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,721
you can be master of your trades domain 
and be unbelievably economically useful 

20
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:56,130
and productive and creative and 
independent and autonomous.

21
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,130
And so there's,
there's nothing necessarily subservient 

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,130
about that.
Um,

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,210
now if you're thinking more about about,
let's say life at the low end of a 

24
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:06,810
restaurant,
but even there,

25
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:11,811
if you're a conscientious person and 
you're careful and you and you're awake 

26
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:15,030
and you treat the people around you well
and you do your job properly,

27
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:17,400
there's also room for advancement in the
private sphere.

28
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:22,401
There's no reason to assume whatsoever 
that merely because you don't have the 

29
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,890
intellectual horsepower to work well in 
the Abd,

30
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,450
in that in the domain of rapidly 
shifting abstractions that your life has

31
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:33,840
to be a secondary quality or,
or,

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,850
or opportunity.
I don't see that at all.

33
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,890
And,
and there is endless opportunity in the 

34
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:40,890
trades and,
and I can,

35
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,920
in Toronto for example,
there's a chronic shortage of 

36
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,691
tradespeople and there's always a 
shortage of qualified people for every 

37
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,170
occupation.
So,

38
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:54,171
um,
if I have to tell someone that they're 

39
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:55,380
best suited to a blue collar lifestyle,
I wouldn't feel bad about it.

40
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,220
I might say to them,
well,

41
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:56,830
look,
you know,

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,170
um,
you know,

43
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:00,600
let's assume you're talking to someone 
who has an Iq of 100,

44
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:03,330
which is the Iq of the average high 
school graduate.

45
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,650
You might say,
well look,

46
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:05,990
you know,
um,

47
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,690
unless you're super conscientious,
a,

48
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,970
a career in something like law is 
probably not your best bet because 

49
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,031
you're going to be competing with people
who have iqs that are like 30 points 

50
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:17,580
higher than yours or 25 points higher 
than yours.

51
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:19,920
And if you really work yourself to 
death,

52
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:22,950
you might be able to main maintain 
competitiveness in that domain,

53
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:25,920
but you're going to be working at a 
powerful disadvantage because the people

54
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:27,300
that you're competing with,
for example,

55
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:29,340
are going to be way faster than you 
verbally.

56
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,920
They're going to be able to read faster,
into reason,

57
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:33,840
verbally,
faster and and all of that,

58
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,500
and it might be better to pick a a,
a,

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,940
an ambition that's more in keeping with 
the quality of your temperament and your

60
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:44,760
intelligence to to put it bluntly so 
that you can be,

61
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,040
but that doesn't mean that your success 
has to be limited and it it.

62
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,120
It also doesn't mean that I'm in 
elevating intelligence to to the 

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,260
platform of the ultimate moral ideal 
because the relationship between 

64
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,490
intelligence and moral ideal is zero.
There is no relationship between them at

65
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:02,050
all.
Intelligence is a,

66
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,320
is a capacity,
let's say that can be put to ill use 

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,540
just as well as to good use and there's 
nothing intrinsically better about smart

68
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:15,541
people.
They might be more useful for certain 

69
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:15,541
things if they're oriented towards the 
good,

70
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:20,310
but there's absolutely.
There's no shortage of opportunity in 

71
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,171
the working class end of the end of the 
world and I can certainly understand 

72
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:29,880
often why people might prefer that to.
To the endless miasma you might say 

73
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:36,110
chaotic,
Miasma of complex abstract jobs.

74
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,200
One of the problems with those sorts of 
jobs is that you're never done.

75
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,710
It never finished.
There's always more work than you can 

76
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,710
possibly do.
