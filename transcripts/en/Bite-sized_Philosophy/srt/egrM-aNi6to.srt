1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,920
Okay,
well so,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,070
so that that's another issue in some 
sense that seems to make the 

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,100
postmodernist critique even more 
correct.

4
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:13,101
How in the world and going to extract 
out and canonical interpretation of 

5
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:13,980
something like that.
It's like it's not possible,

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,450
but here's the issue as far as I can 
tell the interpreter,

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,300
so in the postmodernists extended that 
critique to the world,

8
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:21,810
they said,
look,

9
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:23,580
well,
a text is complicated enough.

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,920
You can extract out a canonical 
interpretation.

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,550
What about the world?
The world is way more complicated than a

12
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:34,551
text and so there's an infinite number 
of ways that you can look at the world 

13
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:36,660
and so how do we know that any one way 
is better than any other way?

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,920
And that's a good question.
Now the postmodern answer was we can't 

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and that's not a good answer because you
drowned in chaos under those 

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
circumstances,
right?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,650
You can't make sense of anything and 
that's not good because

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,790
it's not neutral to not make sense of 
things.

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,600
It's very anxiety provoking.
It's very depressing because if things 

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,050
are so chaotic that you can't get a 
handle on them,

21
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,230
your body defaults into emergency 
preparation mode and your heart rate 

22
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,000
goes up and your immune system stops 
working and like you burn yourself out,

23
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:15,470
you age rapidly because you're 
surrounded by nothing you can control.

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,810
It's varying.
That's an existential crisis,

25
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,970
right?
It's anxiety provoking in depressing,

26
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,700
very hard on people and even more than 
that,

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,900
it turns out that the way that we're 
constructed neurophysiologically is that

28
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:30,740
we don't experience any positive emotion
unless we have an aim

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,680
and we can see ourselves progressing 
towards that aim.

30
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,150
It isn't precisely attaining the aim 
that makes us happy.

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,360
As you all know,
if you've ever attained anything because

32
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:47,470
soon as you attain it,
then the whole little game ends and you 

33
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:47,850
have to come up with another game,
right?

34
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:50,980
So it's sisyphus and that's okay,
but,

35
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:56,010
but it does show that the attainment 
can't be the thing that drives you 

36
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,361
because it collapses the game.
That's what happens when you graduate 

37
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:02,361
from university.
It's like you're king of the mountain 

38
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:02,580
for one day and then you're like surf 
at,

39
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,480
at,
at,

40
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:05,860
at starbucks for the next five years,
you know,

41
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,900
so,
so what happens is that that human 

42
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,540
beings are weird creatures because we're
much more activated by having an aim and

43
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,670
moving towards it than we are by 
attainment.

44
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,671
And what that means is you have to have 
an aim and that means you have to have 

45
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:24,900
an interpretation and it also means that
the nobler aim,

46
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,660
that's one way of thinking about it,
the better your life.

47
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,540
And that's a really interesting thing to
know because you know,

48
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,690
you've heard ever since you were tiny 
that you should act like a good person 

49
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:35,690
and you shouldn't lie,
for example,

50
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,530
and you might think,
well,

51
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,280
why the hell should I not like a good 
person?

52
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,830
Why not lie in even a three year old can
ask that question because smart,

53
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,960
smart kids learn to lie earlier,
by the way,

54
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,580
and they think,
well,

55
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,450
why not twist the fabric of reality so 
that it serves your specific short term 

56
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,060
needs?
I mean,

57
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:56,130
that's a great question.
Why not do that?

58
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,190
Why Act morally if you can get away with
something and it brings you closer to 

59
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,100
something you want,
well why not do it?

60
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,890
These are good questions.
It's not self evident.

61
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,220
Well,
it seems to be tied in with what I just 

62
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,740
mentioned.
It's like you destabilize yourself and 

63
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:13,740
things become chaotic.

64
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,430
That's not good,
and if you don't have a no blame,

65
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:20,431
then you have nothing but but shallow 
trivial pleasures and they don't sustain

66
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:26,470
you and that's not good because because 
life is so difficult,

67
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:28,270
so much,
it's so much suffering.

68
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:33,271
It's so complex.
It ends and everyone dies and it's 

69
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:34,150
painful.
It's like without a noble aim,

70
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,940
how can you withstand any of that?
You can't.

71
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,270
You become desperate and once you become
desperate things go.

72
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,840
Things go from bad to worse,
very rapidly when you become desperate,

73
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:48,010
and so there's the idea of the noble aim
and it's not something.

74
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,190
It's something that's necessary.
It's the bread that people cannot live 

75
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,190
without,
right?

76
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,320
That's not physical bread.
It's the noble aim and what is that?

77
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,860
Well,
it was encapsulated in part in the story

78
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:00,850
of Marduk.
That's,

79
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,910
that's to pay attention.
It's to speak properly,

80
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,970
it's to confront chaos,
it's to make a better world.

81
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,970
It's something like that and that's 
enough of a no blame so that you can 

82
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,500
stand up without,
you know,

83
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,640
cringing at the very thought of your own
existence so that you can do something 

84
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,040
that's worthwhile to justify your 
wretched position on the planet.

85
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,910
So now there's a literary issue.
Is that.

86
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,660
So look,
you take a text,

87
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:31,480
you can interpret it a variety of ways,
but that's not right.

88
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,310
This is where the postmodernist went 
wrong because what you're looking for in

89
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,380
a text and in the world for that matter 
is,

90
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,490
is sufficient order and direction.
So then we have to think,

91
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:47,491
well,
what is sufficient order and direction 

92
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:49,561
means well,
you don't want to suffer so much that 

93
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:49,561
your life is unbearable.
Right?

94
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:53,800
That just seems self evident.
Pain argues for itself,

95
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,090
I think of pain as the fundamental 
reality because no one disputes it,

96
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:58,870
right?

97
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,750
I mean even if you say that you don't 
believe in pain,

98
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,440
it doesn't help when you're in pain,
you still believe in it,

99
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:05,800
right?
It's,

100
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:06,370
it's,
it's.

101
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,510
You can't pry it up with logic and 
rationality,

102
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:15,511
it just stands forthe as as what the 
fundament of existence and that's 

103
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:16,420
actually quite useful to know.
Say,

104
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:21,421
well,
you don't want any more of that than is 

105
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,120
absolutely necessary and I think that's 
self evident and then you say,

106
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,890
wait a minute.
It's more complicated than that.

107
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,160
You don't want any more of that.
That's necessary today,

108
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,190
but also not tomorrow and not next week,
not next month,

109
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,220
not next year,
so however you act now better not 

110
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,421
compromise how you're going to be in a 
year because that would just be 

111
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:42,510
counterproductive.
That's part of the problem with short 

112
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:42,510
term pleasures,
right?

113
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,200
It's like active haste,
repented leisure.

114
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:49,201
Everyone knows exactly what that means,
so you have to act in a way that works 

115
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,890
now and tomorrow and next week and next 
month and so forth,

116
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:55,891
and so you have to take your future self
into account and human beings can do 

117
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:59,360
that and taking your future self into 
account isn't much different than taking

118
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,740
other people into account.

119
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:06,190
Right?
Because I remember there's this Simpson 

120
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,981
episode and a homer downs,
a quart of Manet's and vodka.

121
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,540
He says,
I'm someone's.

122
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,430
Marge says,
you know,

123
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:21,431
you shouldn't really do that,
and homer says that's a problem for 

124
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:21,431
future homer.
I share.

125
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:22,940
I'm sure.
Glad I'm not that guy.
