1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,240
I love my child,
I love my mother so much that I couldn't

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:10,530
survive if anything happened to them.
It's like you have some serious thinking

3
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:15,531
to do about that.
It's like you really want to curse 

4
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:15,531
someone with that kind of love.
Do you?

5
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:17,110
I couldn't live without you.
It's like,

6
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:20,310
oh my God,
get away from me.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,740
Really?
It's terrible.

8
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:24,650
That's the oedipal mother.
That's like,

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,420
I'll forgive you.
No matter what you do.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,230
It's like,
really?

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,800
He,
no matter what I do a.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,750
You are not my friend.
That's for sure.

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,140
Not at all.
It's a horrible thing to do to someone 

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,050
that's,
that's the witch in the Hansel and 

15
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,561
Gretel story,
all gingerbread and outside to the last 

16
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:49,221
kid inside.
You feed them candy and make them fat 

17
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:49,920
and eat them.
Right?

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,170
That's Hansel and Gretel.
That's the oedipal mother.

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,010
That's one of Freud's major discoveries 
if gets a major discovery.

20
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,270
It's like the devouring force of love.
You want the person to be able to stand 

21
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,380
on their own and the price you pay for 
that is that you stand on your own.

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,830
It's like good to have you around.
Glad you're here,

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,850
but if,
if,

24
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,570
if tragedies when and if and when 
tragedy strikes either of us,

25
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:17,571
I hope that one of us is standing when 
it blows past and that there's a 

26
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:22,491
harshness about that.
That's unbelievably cruel because you 

27
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:22,491
know,
you say,

28
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:22,491
well,
if my mother died,

29
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:23,730
I could live.
What,

30
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:28,731
what kind of monster are you?
Exactly you the death of your mother 

31
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:28,731
doesn't do you in.
Well,

32
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:30,600
it turns out that being a monster is the
right thing.

33
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,350
So,
and that's a rough thing to learn,

34
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,310
but it's necessary necessarily learn,
you know,

35
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,730
because it also makes you,
you know,

36
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,990
at some point,
for example,

37
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,190
as you get older,
by the time you're in your mid twenties,

38
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:49,191
something like that,
you should start having a relationship 

39
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:49,191
with your parents.

40
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:53,600
That's approximately one of peers and 
you can tell if you have that.

41
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:56,910
So here's a little trick you can use.
So you have parents,

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
obviously they have friends,
you probably care what your parents 

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
think.
I would imagine.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,880
Do you care what their friends think of 
you?

45
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,650
And the answer to that is,
well,

46
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:06,540
not nearly as much.
And so then I would say,

47
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:11,541
well,
why do you care what your parents think 

48
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:11,541
of you?
Then they're the same people.

49
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:15,980
You know what I mean?
It's just luck of the draw that your 

50
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:15,980
parents or someone else's kids,
friends,

51
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,730
they don't think the same way about them
that you do.

52
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:23,731
Well,
that's where you see that you have a 

53
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:23,731
projection,
right?

54
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:26,721
If by the time you're 30,
if what your parents think of you 

55
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:27,210
matters more than what,
say a random set of their friends.

56
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:32,211
Think of you,
then you've still got your parents 

57
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:32,211
confused with with God.

58
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:36,200
That's one way of looking at it.
You've still got them confused with an 

59
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,290
archetype and you're still a child and 
you might think,

60
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,850
well,
it's pretty damn rude not to think about

61
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:40,860
what your parents think of you anymore.
Not to care.

62
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,790
It's like,
yeah,

63
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,190
it's kind of rude,
but maybe you'll be useful for them when

64
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:47,850
they get old.
And that's a much better form of caring.

65
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,880
It's like you're going to be independent
enough and strong enough and and 

66
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,360
detached enough so that when the,
when the,

67
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,210
when the power dynamic shifts,
which it will,

68
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,170
that you'll be the person that can carry
things forward.

69
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Well,
you can't do a better thing for them 

70
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,500
than that.
Right?

71
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,840
That's the best of all possible outcomes
for your parents.
