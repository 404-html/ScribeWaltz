1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,630
The chaos is hiding in what's irrelevant
and so,

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,930
and that's very interesting observation 
because since the chaos is virtually 

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,441
infinite,
it's a real question is where the hell 

4
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:14,620
do you put it while you put it in what 
you ignore and you can ignore it as long

5
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:17,380
as it isn't actively interfering with 
your movement forward,

6
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:22,381
you can assume that it's that it doesn't
matter that it doesn't matter that it 

7
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:24,500
doesn't matter.
Same thing.

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,750
All right?
So here's the kicker.

9
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:32,751
There's one more class of things that 
you can run into along the way and this 

10
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:36,330
is where the chaos breaks through.
So let's say

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,520
you're moving from point a to point b 
and something that you don't expect 

12
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,890
occurs and it gets in the way.
So let's say that you're living with 

13
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:55,900
someone and maybe you kind of liked 
them.

14
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,110
You're not married so you don't like 
them that much because otherwise you'd 

15
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,180
ask them to marry you.
But anyways,

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,340
um,
and so ha,

17
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,440
quarter of youth as looking for 
something better and three quarters view

18
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,310
is half satisfied,
something like that.

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,960
And then a person because we're 
ambivalent about such things.

20
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:18,961
And then the person you discover or the 
person announces that they've been 

21
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:19,690
having an affair.
Okay.

22
00:01:19,691 --> 00:01:22,840
So then how are you supposed to respond 
emotionally to that?

23
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,170
Well,
the part of you that wasn't all that 

24
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:28,170
committed to the relationship is kind of
exhilarated by that.

25
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,820
And then the three quarters of you 
that's half satisfied is hurt and,

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and you're going to exploit that part 
for sure in the ensuing discussions and 

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
not mention the,
oh,

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,440
that's kind of exciting that you've 
betrayed me that way.

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,630
So,
so,

30
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,480
but the point is,
is that you,

31
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,930
that's a whole.
Now what's happened is a whole has you 

32
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,381
have this structure that you're walking 
on ice thin ice that you're skating on 

33
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:55,270
and now there's a hole in it and the 
whole,

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,450
we don't even know how deep the hole is,
but you know there's a hole there and so

35
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:03,451
now you're anxious about it.
They'll maybe also a little bit excited 

36
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:03,850
because God only knows what's down there
but,

37
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,950
but you don't know what to do with that 
whole because it could spread very badly

38
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:13,951
on you.
It could be that you know the whole 

39
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:16,231
relationship was a facade and that all 
your relationships have been facades,

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,300
facades,
and that the reason that is is because 

41
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,671
you're so damn shallow that it's 
impossible for you to have a 

42
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:26,011
relationship that isn't just a facade 
and that's partly because you don't pay 

43
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:30,061
any attention to other people and it's 
also partly because you're malevolent 

44
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:32,851
and selfish,
so that's a nasty thing to discover or 

45
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:33,730
maybe that's the sort of person that 
you're attracting,

46
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:38,731
which would make sense actually,
if that's the sort of person that you 

47
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:40,210
are and so,
so there are certain things that you can

48
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:45,211
encounter that basically unglue you,
and what happens is that those moments 

49
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:48,940
of being unglued travel up that entire 
hierarchy of presuppositions.

50
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,390
It's like because the one of the logical
conclusions to being betrayed in a 

51
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,860
relationship is that you are,
that you're truly a bad person.

52
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,250
Now another equally logical conclusion 
is that the person that you're with is 

53
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:08,311
really a bad person,
and another logical conclusion is all 

54
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:09,250
people are truly bad people.
You know,

55
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,440
I mean in,
in,

56
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,800
in macro ways,
at,

57
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,500
in microwaves.
You can't trust anyone.

58
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,180
You can't trust women.
You can't trust men.

59
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:18,370
You can't trust human beings.
You can't trust yourself.

60
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,700
The whole place is a catastrophe.
It's a nightmare.

61
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,150
Well,
then you can fall through into chaos.

62
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,180
Now the way your body responds to that 
or maybe you know you're supposed to be 

63
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,820
getting a promotion at work,
that's good.

64
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:35,821
You're all chipper about the promotion 
at work and you walk into your boss's 

65
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:38,620
office because he or she wants to see 
you and they say,

66
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,060
well,
you know,

67
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:45,061
we've reviewed your performance over the
last few years and your performance has 

68
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:51,361
been somewhere between mediocre and 
decent and we're downsizing and see you 

69
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:53,090
later.

70
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,910
That's not a raise or a promotion,
that's for sure.

71
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,110
That's a whole that you fall into and 
the question is,

72
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,370
well,
what do you make of that?

73
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,710
Right?
How do you frame that?

74
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:09,550
How do you take that emergent chaos and 
make habitable order out of?

75
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,850
You don't know.
Is the whole capitalist system rotten to

76
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:14,080
the core?
I mean,

77
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,840
that's a convenient explanation under 
those circumstances.

78
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:21,841
That's for sure.
Where you're working for a psychopathic 

79
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:24,541
son of a bitch.
Did you make the wrong choice in 

80
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,721
university and was that your father's 
fault because you never did what you 

81
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:30,901
wanted or was it your fault for not 
standing up to them or is it a dying 

82
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:34,980
industry or is maybe there's a wake up 
call that you should go do something 

83
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,921
else that you've been waiting to do you 
know that you've actually wanted to do 

84
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:41,341
your whole life and that's why you're 
doing such a miserable job at your 

85
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:44,791
current occupation because you're bitter
and resentful about the fact that you 

86
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:44,791
never did what you want.

87
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:49,320
You don't know.
It's all of those things at once and 

88
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,381
that's very stressful because all of 
those things at once is too many things 

89
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:55,540
and that's the reemergence of chaos.
That's the flood.

90
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,810
That's the return to the beginning of 
the cosmos.

91
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:00,490
That's another way that it's been 
represented.

92
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:05,491
Mythologically.
It's the you voyage all the way back to 

93
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:08,341
the beginning of the cosmos when there's
nothing but undifferentiated chaos and 

94
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:12,040
that's what you're confronting and maybe
it's too much for you and often it is.

95
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:17,041
I mean that that can really.
That can be traumatizing and it can hurt

96
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:22,261
your brain,
you know it's just too much for you to 

97
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:22,261
bear,
but it doesn't matter.

98
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:23,740
You're stuck with it,
and so how do you respond to that?

99
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,770
Well,
some of it is catastrophic negative 

100
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,321
emotion.
You freeze and that's protective and 

101
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:31,930
maybe you don't even want to move.
You don't want to bloody well get out of

102
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:36,520
bed for a week and that's because your 
body is reacting as if the bedroom floor

103
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:39,580
is covered with snakes and the best 
thing for you to do is just not move.

104
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,730
Just freeze.
Not a pleasant situation to be in 

105
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,580
because it's your hyperaroused very,
very physiologically demanding and 

106
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,250
there's zero about it that's productive 
except maybe the snakes won't see you,

107
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,010
but they've already seen you,
so that isn't helping very well.

108
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,200
So you've got all this undifferentiated 
native,

109
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,460
negative emotion,
fear,

110
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,330
hurt,
anger,

111
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:00,230
guilt,
shame,

112
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:03,320
emotional pain,
the whole plethora of catastrophes.

113
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,040
And then maybe on the other side lurking
down there is,

114
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,060
thank God I'm done with that job.
I just bloody well hated.

115
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,100
I dragged myself off to work every day 
and there's a little part of my soul 

116
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,931
that so goddamn happy.
I finally got fired that I can hardly 

117
00:06:19,931 --> 00:06:19,931
stand it.
You know,

118
00:06:19,931 --> 00:06:21,590
and maybe you don't even admit that to 
yourself because,

119
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,910
well,
that would mean that all that time you 

120
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,200
spent at the job was just sunk costs.
You're diluting yourself the whole time.

121
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Um,
it is an interesting thing to consider 

122
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,201
those sometimes if you're in the 
unpleasant circumstance of having to 

123
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:35,780
fire someone,
you know,

124
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:38,840
sometimes firing someone is the best 
thing that can happen to them,

125
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:42,170
which doesn't mean that you should go 
out and like enjoy it.

126
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,220
Although I have met very disagreeable 
people who actually enjoyed firing 

127
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,220
people.

128
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,690
And I'll tell you a story about that at 
some point because it's quite 

129
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:52,690
interesting,
but you know,

130
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,890
sometimes if someone's just limping 
along in their job and doing it as 

131
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,540
miserably in wretchedly as they possibly
can imagine,

132
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,120
the best thing you can do to them for 
them is to say,

133
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,060
you know,
you're failing at this.

134
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:10,570
And,
and that doesn't necessarily mean that 

135
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,330
you would have to be failing at 
absolutely everything else in the entire

136
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:16,331
world.
So maybe you should just accept the dam 

137
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:16,331
failure and go off and try something 
new.

138
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:21,450
And I mean,
that's terrifying for people and I know 

139
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:21,450
they hate it and all that,
but,

140
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,530
but,
but sometimes it's better than the 

141
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:26,530
alternative,
which is just slow,

142
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,290
torturous death.
