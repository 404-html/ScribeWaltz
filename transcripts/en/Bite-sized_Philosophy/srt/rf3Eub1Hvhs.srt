1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,860
I guess they call themselves in cells,
involuntary celibates when all this 

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,760
stuff went down with his car,
drove his car into a group of people.

3
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:13,761
It's horrible tragedy.
I'm one of the things that you talked 

4
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:17,460
about within cells is that,
and this was a part of the role,

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,760
what was it?
The News in New York Times piece you,

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,050
you said one of the cures for this is 
enforced monogamy.

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,610
People decided and you know,
I had never heard that term before quite

8
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:30,630
honestly,
and I was like,

9
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:31,800
Whoa,
what the fuck does that mean?

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,250
It's a psychological term and what it 
means is enforced by culture that it is 

11
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:39,440
a good value.
Monogamy,

12
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,910
polygamy.
Polygamous societies tend to become 

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:44,910
ultra violent.
Yeah.

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,591
That's been known in the anthropological
literature for one Hundred Years and 

15
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:50,250
certainly leftist anthropologists were 
among those who discovered it,

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,980
like she knew the journalist knew 
perfectly well.

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,330
What I meant by enforcement,
Augie,

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,320
she has got a stupid.
It's a.

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,980
You use it as if everybody would 
understand it because you're an 

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,010
intellectual and because you're a 
professor and you do.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,690
It was also two minutes out of a two day
conversation.

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,990
So if that's how she glanced over,
well,

23
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:14,991
it's so funny.
That was funny in some sense because my 

24
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,421
sense is if you want to pillory someone 
you should attribute to them views that 

25
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:21,951
someone somewhere has had and the 
implication of that part of the New York

26
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,660
Times article was that I wanted to take 
new bile,

27
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:29,661
young women at the point of a gun 
understate enforcement and deliver them 

28
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:33,710
to useless man.
It's like no one has ever believed that 

29
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,010
trinity sounds like that.
It's a real.

30
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,530
The optics of that statement are very 
bad,

31
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:42,531
but the question is why didn't.
Why wasn't their followup questions and 

32
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:46,821
if there was followup questions to get 
you to define what you mean by 

33
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:47,910
enforcement on there were they just 
didn't make it into the piece.

34
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,200
That's a real problem.
Yeah,

35
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:54,210
it's a real problem.
That's a real problem because that's 

36
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,840
what that is.
It's so ridiculous because inaccurate 

37
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,290
definition of who you are.
One of the things I've said continually,

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,530
and this is on record in multiple 
places,

39
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:02,160
it's like,
okay,

40
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:06,090
so you're a young man and all the women 
are rejecting you.

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,100
Who's got the problem?
It's not all the women.

42
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,540
That's a bad road to go down if all the 
women are rejecting you,

43
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,760
it's you.
We both agree on this,

44
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:22,500
but why is enforced monogamy the 
solution for people that are involuntary

45
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:23,910
celibates?
Well,

46
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:28,911
it's the solution to the.
It's the solution to the relationship 

47
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:30,090
between men and women.
Fundamentally is monogamous.

48
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:33,900
Social men are unattractive if these on 
attraction to them,

49
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:38,901
but these men are unattractive to women.
I don't mean just physically 

50
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:39,810
unattractive mean women aren't seeking 
them as mates.

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,540
They need to become men.
Yes,

52
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:47,541
they certainly.
This is the solution that's the 

53
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:47,541
solution.
Absolutely.

54
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,541
We both agree on this,
so what they need to do that in a 

55
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,320
society where monogamy is the social 
norm but isn't the social norm anyway?

56
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,050
Well,
that was partly my point,

57
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,050
although to the degree that we deviate 
from that,

58
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,160
we tilt towards a more violent society.

59
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,340
I was making a very minor point.
I don't think they're related.

60
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:08,341
Quite honestly,
I don't think that involuntary 

61
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:10,741
celibates.
I don't think that having enforced 

62
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:13,220
monogamy as a part of our cultural norm 
is going to help those people are really

63
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,690
just how's it going to help them?

64
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,850
Well,
because what happens is if a polygamous 

65
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:19,850
society develops,
which is the alternative,

66
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,630
then a small minority of men get all the
women.

67
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,550
That's what happened.
That's the only point in this theory,

68
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,790
theoretical world where polygamous 
societies exist and mass and then you do

69
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:37,550
have this problem with a small group of 
men that are fucking all the women,

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,740
but that's not.

71
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,230
And also making the women unhappy.
Right?

72
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,260
Because the women don't have any access 
to a genuine intimate one to one 

73
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,720
relationship over any long period of 
time,

74
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,940
which just doesn't work well.
It's the whole idea is and what's best 

75
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,340
for sure if you have children.
Right,

76
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,150
but I still don't think that that is why
these men are involuntary celibates and 

77
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,341
I don't think it's the solution to that.
I think the solution is that they need 

78
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:03,341
to become attractive.
Yes,

79
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,880
that is the solution is no doubt.
I don't.

80
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:06,170
I don't think the two are related.

81
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,030
Well,
the only.

82
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,350
I was making a minor point.
The minor point was that one of the ways

83
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:16,351
that societies around the world have 
figured out that you keep young male 

84
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:19,891
aggression under control is by enforcing
monogamous standards because it gives 

85
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:20,620
everyone a chance,
in some sense,

86
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,770
only point meant meaning.
It clears more,

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
uh,
more women will be available for one on 

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,360
one relationships rather than one guy 
who is,

89
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:35,850
you know,

90
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,370
whatever,
for whatever reasons,

91
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,090
figure in society when you see this 
happening in universities where women 

92
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,091
outnumber men,
so the man hypothetically have more 

93
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:48,100
sexual opportunity,
but that isn't what happens.

94
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:51,730
What happens is that a small minority of
men have all the sexual opportunity.

95
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,300
A fairly large minority of men don't.
The women are unhappy because they can't

96
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:58,720
find a committed relationship.
It's bad for most of the men and the men

97
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:00,940
who have all the sexual opportunity get 
cynical,

98
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,350
but isn't this in some ways against your
whole idea of equality of outcome 

99
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,750
because you're,
you're talking about equality of sexual 

100
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:11,750
outcome.
Now,

101
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,770
if these men,
if you see that Guy James,

102
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,430
that's the dominant basketball player 
that just kicks everyone's ass.

103
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,990
This is the,
this,

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,690
this is a guy who succeeded at the 
highest level,

105
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,440
right?
Well,

106
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:24,720
there's going to be people like that 
sexually.

107
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,850
There's going to be people that are 
better at finding mates and this is what

108
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:32,760
they enjoy.
They enjoy having many mates.

109
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,190
They enjoy being yes,
but,

110
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,400
but if this is what they enjoy,
if it's a man who doesn't want a family 

111
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,270
and enjoys dating multiple women,
why is that bad?

112
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,750
Well,
I think the fundamental reason it's bad 

113
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:50,750
is because it's bad in the long run for 
children.

114
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,350
It's bad for children if he chooses to 
have children.

115
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,590
Yeah.
Well that makes sense.

116
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,090
But that's it.
That's the fundamental mental

117
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,590
issue as far as I'm concerned right now.
I think it's the answer.

118
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,120
Look to give the journalist credit.
That is the point she was making,

119
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,550
you know,
apart from pillaring me and,

120
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,150
and,
and,

121
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,970
and caricaturizing my perspective.
That was the point she was making.

122
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,990
Well,
first of all,

123
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:13,991
I'm not in favor of unbridled 
hierarchies like already said that you 

124
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:17,790
know,
the proclivity of a hierarchy is that 

125
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,640
all the spoils go to the person at the 
top and that can destabilize the whole 

126
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,201
structure,
so we have to have a dialogue about how 

127
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:23,201
to rectify that,

128
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:25,670
possibly rectified that.
If one man is like,

129
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,680
say if we've got one six foot five 
beautiful man who's got a perfect body 

130
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:37,801
and he's brilliant and he just wants to 
date a bunch of women and all the rest 

131
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:41,281
of the people or five foot one and 
they're fat and they're lazy and like 

132
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:43,120
this guy is gonna.
If this is the competition,

133
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,550
he's going to win.
Yeah,

134
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,770
Yep.
There's no way around this and even if 

135
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,530
you decide to have enforced monogamy 
where it becomes a popular thing,

136
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,240
the women are going to be more drawn to 
him.

137
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:58,520
If he chooses to date them,
they might decide.

138
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,700
I would rather have him sometimes the 
never actually what does happen,

139
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:05,840
but what is wrong with that?
Well,

140
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,360
what's wrong with it is that it 
destabilized the society and it's bad 

141
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,360
for children.
Right.

142
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
You said that that would have to have 
children,

143
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:15,180
but there's a lot of people that don't 
want to have children.

144
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,300
There's a lot of people that choose to 
go their entire life without having 

145
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,300
children.
There's men in their thirties.

146
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,500
One,
some of my friends dummies.

147
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,910
They don't want children.
So why?

148
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,070
Why would that help in any way?
These involuntary celibate?

149
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Well,
I think you tilt the society so that it 

150
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,300
serves the interests of.
Well,

151
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,240
that's a good question.
Do you,

152
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,150
but you've seen my point where I see 
your point.

153
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,080
There's no doubt about it.

154
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,480
You're almost having.
You're almost forcing an inequality of.

155
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,590
I know that was her point to to the 
degree that she had a point that was her

156
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:51,530
point now,
but it's not.

157
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,810
It doesn't run contrary to my opinions 
that the issue of outcome has to be 

158
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,301
addressed.
Already said there's needs to be a 

159
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:01,301
reason for the left and the right,
and then the problem with hierarchies.

160
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:05,270
They can get to steep and destabilize 
everything that does happen.

161
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,480
That particularly happens in the sexual 
domain and there's plenty of 

162
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,060
anthropological evidence for that,
but you still might say,

163
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,960
well,
who cares?

164
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Because the man who are who are winning 
should be allowed to win in the women 

165
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,360
should be allowed to choose.
Yes,

166
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,540
except that there's the problem of 
children and so society steps in on 

167
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,810
behalf of the children and you can say,
well,

168
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,380
lots of people don't want to have 
children.

169
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,980
Yes,
and that's truer now than it used to be.

170
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:30,890
Although many of those people end up 
having children anyways,

171
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,080
you know the guys who snooping around 
all the time,

172
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:38,081
so that doesn't circumvent the problem,
but the issue here for me isn't the man 

173
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:38,081
or the women,
it's the children.

174
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:43,540
We're trying to set up societies where 
the probability that children will be 

175
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,961
raised in something approximating 
optimal environment is optimized and 

176
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:50,741
that's going to mean sacrifice of 
opportunity and choice on the part of 

177
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:50,741
the adults.

178
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:51,630
It's necessary.
I agree with you,

179
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:56,631
but I think that what we're talking 
about mirrors what we're talking about 

180
00:08:56,631 --> 00:08:56,631
sports.

181
00:08:56,631 --> 00:08:58,200
It mirrors what we're talking about in 
business.

182
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:03,201
It's everything else.
There's going to be people that are 

183
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:06,111
better at all different aspects of life.
There's going to be people that are 

184
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:07,500
talented in terms of like getting women 
to like that.

185
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,640
Yes,
that's true,

186
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:10,530
but that's why also look,
you see this,

187
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,890
women are high pergamum,
which means they made up and they meet 

188
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,910
across and up dominance hierarchies,
and so if you're a male who's successful

189
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:22,911
in a given hierarchy,
the probability that you're going to 

190
00:09:22,911 --> 00:09:22,911
have additional mating opportunities is 
exceptionally high.

191
00:09:22,911 --> 00:09:24,830
It's an unbelievably good predictor of 
that.

192
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,860
That hypergo me is a very uncomfortable 
discussion.

193
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Certainly as well.
There's plenty of uncomfortable 

194
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,080
discussions too.
That's a big one though.

195
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,990
It is the idea that it defines women's 
sexual choices by the fact that they 

196
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,161
want beggar bigger,
better want someone who's more more 

197
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:47,060
successful,
someone who's higher on the social 

198
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,690
ladder than what they're accustomed to 
or what they have.

199
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,990
What women do is choice is a very 
difficult problem.

200
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,640
So how do you solve that?
Well,

201
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:55,770
here's how women solve it.
Throw them in a ring.

202
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,990
Let them compete at whatever they're 
competing at.

203
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,140
Assume that the man who wins is the best
man marry him.

204
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,300
Yes.
It's a brilliant solution.

205
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,480
It's a market oriented solution.
It's actually the solution that appears 

206
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,810
to have driven our evolutionary 
departure from chimpanzees.

207
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,220
It's a biological solution solution 
which has a cost.

208
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,000
What is the cost?
The cost is the cost is polygamy,

209
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,100
and so we ran that in with enforced 
monogamy and we do that in order to 

210
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,190
provide stable,
stable circumstances for children.

211
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Is polyamorous.
Is a polyamorous society just as 

212
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,841
unattainable as this Utopian Marxist 
idea?

213
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,060
I think so because it looks like,
and this is another point I was making 

214
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,780
that didn't get covered in the article 
that I wrote about it somewhat 

215
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,201
extensively on my blog,
is that society's tilt towards monogamy 

216
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:49,830
across the world is human universal.

217
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,570
Now,
that doesn't mean that people don't have

218
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:56,571
polygamous or polyamorous tendencies 
because they certainly do and it 

219
00:10:56,571 --> 00:11:00,691
certainly also the case that one of the 
ways that women Gerrymander this system 

220
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:04,281
is that like the number of women and 
children who are in a say say you're 

221
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:08,430
married and you have children with your 
husband,

222
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,700
but you also have an affair and so you 
have a child by another mat that's more 

223
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,111
common than anyone suspected,
so part of the way that women solve the 

224
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:22,281
problem that you're just describing,
and I'm not saying anything for this or 

225
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:26,211
against this,
this is a purely factual biological 

226
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:28,641
claim,
is they pick a monogamous marriage and 

227
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:31,221
they cheat with high status guys.
Now you know obviously in the confines 

228
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:32,400
of the marriage,
that's a terrible thing,

229
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,140
but that's a very uncomfortable subject 
though for women in particular,

230
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,160
uncomfortable subject for everyone,
but it's a terribly uncomfortable 

231
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,160
subject.

232
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,360
They don't like the idea that this is a 
common thing that women choose.

233
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:50,361
A safe man that is willing to be 
monogamous with them and perhaps maybe 

234
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:53,890
they're above him in a social class or 
in a sexually,

235
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,280
and then they'll cheat with someone who 
was above.

236
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,130
It's common,
but it's not the norm,

237
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,600
right?
It's still the norm.

238
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,430
Not to do that.
The norm is fidelity,

239
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,890
but.
But there's plenty of exception.

240
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,290
This is enforced monogamy,
culturally the norm.

241
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,080
This is the very definition of monogamy 
is this.

242
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:11,680
It's like,
okay,

243
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:15,430
so my son is getting married in 
September and so,

244
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,410
so let's say he comes to me in a year 
and he says,

245
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:18,370
Hey dad,
guess what?

246
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,220
I've had three affairs in the last year 
and they've all been successful.

247
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,260
I haven't got caught.
Aren't I a good guy?

248
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,520
What am I going to say to that?
Know what the hell are you doing?

249
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,200
That's not what you're supposed to be 
doing.

250
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,920
That's enforced monogamy enforcement.
Origami meaning the people around you 

251
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,100
try to guide them in a way that you 
think is going to be harmonious.

252
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:39,730
Family,
yes.

253
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,030
It's built deep into the cultural norms 
and if that starts to destabilize,

254
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:48,031
then there's trouble and that doesn't 
mean that it's not prone to all the 

255
00:12:48,031 --> 00:12:48,940
problems that you laid out.
Look,

256
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:52,600
there isn't a bigger problem than 
successful reproduction.

257
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:58,170
It is the big problem and all of the 
solutions that we've generated for it 

258
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,740
are full of flaws.
