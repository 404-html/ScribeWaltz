1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,950
He and I had another client who could be
lucid in her dreams,

2
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:09,951
which is more common among women.
She could ask the damn characters what 

3
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:10,620
they represented and they would tell 
her.

4
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:12,090
It was like,
okay,

5
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:17,091
that was pretty weird.
And like a lot of the things they told 

6
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:18,870
her were really helpful and they were 
not things that she wanted to hear.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,180
She,
she basically,

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,850
one of them told her she,
if she was going to live,

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,330
she'd have to go visit a slaughterhouse.
And the reason for that was because she 

10
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:34,401
was raised as a little princess and 
protected from horrible mother nature 

11
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:39,170
until she hit puberty,
in which time she turned into an evil 

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:39,220
villain because that's how the family 
work.

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,440
Perfect child evil teenager overnight.
And then,

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,190
well that was hard on her and she wasn't
prepared because she thought the world 

15
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,990
was princess world and she couldn't go 
through a butcher store without having a

16
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:52,500
fit.

17
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,790
And no wonder,
you know,

18
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,000
like really Jesus,
it's no wonder,

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,400
but you do it.
But she couldn't.

20
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:02,460
So we used to go to butcher stores and 
that would make her cry.

21
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:03,920
And,
and um,

22
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,330
she was a vegetarian that would make her
cry and it will be mon the cruelty of 

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:09,330
the world.
And it's like,

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,350
yeah,
fair enough,

25
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:12,120
man,
those are bloody slabs of meat.

26
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:17,121
It's like,
I don't know why everyone isn't 

27
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:17,121
screaming when they walked through the 
butcher store,

28
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:21,440
but,
but you gotta get used to it band 

29
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:21,440
because you can't live in the world 
otherwise.

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,331
And so the dream character who was a 
gypsy told her that she had to go visit 

31
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:28,530
a slaughterhouse,
which seemed rather impractical.

32
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,540
And so I asked her if she could think of
anything else to do and she thought,

33
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,550
well,
why don't we go visit a funeral home 

34
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:37,550
and,
and watch an embalming?

35
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:37,800
And I thought,
oh good,

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,040
that sounds,
that sounds like a fun way to spend a 

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,131
day.
And so I phoned up a funeral parlor and 

38
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:48,080
I said,
I declined.

39
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:53,110
It was terrified of death now.
And I was a therapist who was also a 

40
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,100
little shaky on the concept myself.
And so they,

41
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,310
they had no problem with that.
They deal with death all the time,

42
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,840
which is really something to think 
about,

43
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:05,841
right?
A human being can actually have an 

44
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:07,911
occupation where they do nothing but 
deal with death and they don't go stark 

45
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:09,150
raving mad.
It's like,

46
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:14,151
what the hell is up with that?
It's like working in a palliative care 

47
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:15,630
ward where your clients that you have a 
relationship,

48
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,300
all they're going to do is die this 
week,

49
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,680
next week,
the week after.

50
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,790
People do that.
It's like those people are tough man.

51
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,520
They're tough.
So anyways,

52
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,500
we went and watched this embalming,
which was,

53
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,340
I have a rather high level of disgust 
sensitivity.

54
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,970
So it was a little on the rough side for
me.

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,900
But she sat there and first,
well she was not,

56
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,590
we were outside this little room.
She was not looking at that man no way.

57
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,860
And she'd kind of go like this and you 
know,

58
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,890
that was pretty good.
And then she'd go like this and then she

59
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:54,891
go like this and then.
And she watched it and then she asked if

60
00:02:55,171 --> 00:03:00,171
she could go in and she put on a glove 
and she touched the body and she didn't 

61
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:04,230
a fit.
She didn't have a panic attack and so 

62
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,231
she walked away from their learning that
there was a hell of a lot more to her 

63
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:11,041
than she thought there was and that she 
could see things that she didn't think 

64
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,951
she could see and live,
and after that she sort of had a 

65
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:13,951
touchstone.
It's like,

66
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,520
well,
I'm kind of afraid of this.

67
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,550
Well,
is it as bad as going to see the 

68
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,550
bombing?
No,

69
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,550
it's not that bad.
Well,

70
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,940
I guess I can do it.
It's like an initiation,

71
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:24,520
right?
She had an initiation and so did I.

72
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,910
You know,
and I learned a lot from doing that.

73
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:30,850
I learned that one of the things you 
need to do if you're going to be a human

74
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:34,300
being is to prepare yourself to be 
useful in the face of death.

75
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,100
And so when you have a parent that dies,
which shatters people's ideas,

76
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:43,000
often they can't even think about it.
If you can't even think about that,

77
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,240
man,
you've got some thinking to do because 

78
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,720
you need to be able to at least think 
about that because otherwise you're just

79
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:53,530
going to be a wasteland when it happens 
and you never know.

80
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:58,531
You could even have a higher ambition.
Maybe you could even be useful when it 

81
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:02,551
happens instead of being part of the 
heap of destroyed people who also have 

82
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:04,180
to be taken care of,
you know,

83
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:09,181
and that's brutal.
You have to be brutal to be useful in 

84
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,300
the aftermath of your parents' death.
You know,

85
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:13,490
you don't get to crumble and fall apart 
and no,

86
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,500
you have every reason to.
So you got to be kind of some tough 

87
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,370
monster to manage that,
but you want to be useful in the face of

88
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:26,110
tragedy or do you want to be pathetic?
Well,

89
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,430
you make your choice.
