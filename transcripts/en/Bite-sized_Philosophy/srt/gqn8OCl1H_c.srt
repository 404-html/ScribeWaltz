1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,840
All right,
so Jonah gets a call from God and God 

2
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:14,591
tells him that there's a city Nineveh 
that's falling into moral disarray.

3
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,840
Now,
what does that mean?

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,200
Well,
it's a universal story.

5
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:25,940
It's like all cultures are always 
falling into disarray.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,450
It's their nature.
Just entropy does that,

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,430
right?
Things change.

8
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:36,431
The world changes.
The environment changes and the culture 

9
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:39,221
doesn't keep up very well,
and then of course it has corrupt 

10
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:40,550
elements and so it's an inherent eternal
story.

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,030
The individual is always placed in 
relationship to a culture that somewhat 

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,440
corrupt,
and then the question is,

13
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:50,300
well,
what do you do about it?

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,200
And if the answer is nothing,
well then it'll just get more corrupt 

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,240
and if the answer is be corrupt too,
then it will just get more corrupt.

16
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,870
So the answer has to be to oppose the 
corruption because that's the only way 

17
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:08,030
it's going to stop.

18
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,350
Now,
God threatens to destroy this city 

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,890
because of its corruption,
and I don't think you need to presume 

20
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:22,490
anything particularly metaphysical about
that to understand it.

21
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,510
It's very straightforward that the more 
corrupt the culture is and the less 

22
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,100
trust is possible between individuals,
the less productive of the culture is 

23
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,091
going to be because why do anything,
if some corrupt person is just going to 

24
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:37,740
come and take it,
you know it,

25
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,980
it might even be that the culture is so 
corrupted.

26
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,480
If you are good for something and you 
produce resources,

27
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,690
you're actually more likely to get 
killed because you have something of 

28
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:49,690
value.
So like there's just,

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,380
you're just not going anywhere with 
that.

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,350
And why would you work if you didn't 
have any sense that you know,

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,440
you could store up the value of your 
work for some reasonable time in the 

32
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,060
future.
So if the society is corrupt and there's

33
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:04,520
no trust,
it's degenerating and you know,

34
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:07,580
it might live for awhile but isn't going
to last very long.

35
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:10,190
And so that's the idea.
Corrupt societies collapse.

36
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,400
That leaves open what corruption means.
Anyways,

37
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,170
Jonah,
thanks.

38
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,790
No,
no bloody way.

39
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:25,420
I'm not going to that city.
It can go to hell as far as I'm 

40
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:25,420
concerned and that's really what he 
thinks.

41
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,400
And why in the world should I do 
anything about it anyways?

42
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,950
And these are good objections.
It's like,

43
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,250
why would you do that?
And you'll face this,

44
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,760
believe me in your life,
you will face this.

45
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:40,280
In fact,
you already do always constantly,

46
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:45,490
continually in small ways perhaps when 
you're interacting with people who 

47
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,020
aren't treating you properly and when 
you're acting.

48
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,150
And those might be your parents,
they might be your friends,

49
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:53,240
they might be people at your workplace,
they might be professors,

50
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,480
they're playing a crooked game and you 
don't like it and you know it's crooked.

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,250
And so then the question is,
well,

52
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,960
what should you do about it?
Well,

53
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:06,080
if you know your crib,
no,

54
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,830
it's crooked.
It's not so good to play along with it.

55
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,210
I mean,
we'll say that you know,

56
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,130
it's crooked by your own standard of 
values.

57
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,960
It d degrades you to play along with it.
You're going to stand up and oppose it.

58
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,020
Well,
no,

59
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,710
probably not.
You're probably going to do what Jonah 

60
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,041
did.
Jump on a ship and get the hell out of 

61
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:29,041
there.
And you know,

62
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:33,690
that's a logical thing to do,
but it doesn't solve the problem and I 

63
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,561
think this has something to do with 
human ethical responsibility because 

64
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:41,371
there are other old stories,
and I'll tell you one likely where the 

65
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:46,180
son of the king,
the lion king,

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,680
the son of the king,
he goes off and he's some pathetic 

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,671
adolescent and then he shamed by the 
reappearance of his old girlfriend into 

68
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,930
turning into something vaguely useful.

69
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,290
And he opens his eyes and he goes back 
and he fights scar and no,

70
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,860
it's a scene of hell,
right?

71
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,900
Because there's fire everywhere.
And he fights.

72
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:10,090
Scar finds out,
scar killed.

73
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:13,810
His father casts him into the pit,
roughly speaking.

74
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:18,100
And then the rain comes and then you 
know,

75
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:23,101
the movie returns to its beginning,
fundamentally paradise,

76
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:25,300
Paradise lost,
paradise regained.

77
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,440
That's the movie.
And and I mean,

78
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,270
that's the story of human beings.
You know,

79
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,430
you're in a place that's working out 
pretty well.

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,520
Something happens to knock you off your 
perch.

81
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,220
You're down in the chaos for a good 
amount of time.

82
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,430
And maybe you never get out,
but maybe you learn something down 

83
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,220
there,
maybe a strength in your character,

84
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,970
then you pop up to a new place and maybe
it's better,

85
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,310
better aim,
better you.

86
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,670
Now,
I'm not being overly optimistic about 

87
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,191
this.
I know perfectly well that people 

88
00:04:59,191 --> 00:04:59,191
encounter

89
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,140
impediments during their life that they 
find almost impossible to recover from,

90
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,540
but it's the best shot you have.
So anyways,

91
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Jonah runs away,
but God isn't very happy about that 

92
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,831
because it's actually joan as destiny.
It's necessary for Jonah to repair the 

93
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:23,601
city so God sends a storm and the waves 
are high and and,

94
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,440
and I think what that means is because 
the water is often a symbol for the 

95
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,801
unconscious and that's because things 
lurk down there in the water and that 

96
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:37,551
you could pull up that that are useful,
monstrous things that you can pull up 

97
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:37,650
their useful.
You can fish for them.

98
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,740
You can go fishing in your own being for
answers,

99
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,080
which is what you do when you try to 
think right,

100
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,750
you ask yourself a question and you 
wait.

101
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,850
Maybe an answer appears.
It's like,

102
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,030
where did that come from?
You didn't know what the answer was 

103
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,920
before it appeared,
what it just pop into being out of 

104
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,120
nowhere.
Who knows?

105
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,370
So you fish.

106
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,090
So anyways,
the waves come and the boat's going to 

107
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,090
be knocked over it.
And that's what happens.

108
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,230
I think when you know,
when you know you should do something.

109
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,910
I mean everyone has the experience,
I believe perhaps you would be willing 

110
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,510
to put up your hands if this experience 
is foreign to you.

111
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,050
Okay?
This part of you're telling you you 

112
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,771
should do something and it's hard to do 
it effortful and maybe you're afraid of 

113
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:28,120
it and so you don't do it.
You just procrastinate.

114
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,520
Right?
And so how do you feel about that?

115
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,180
Good mean.
So what do you feel that you're 

116
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,310
betraying yourself?
Your anxiety actually gets worse,

117
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:44,311
not better,
even though you know you can put it off 

118
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:44,311
moment to moment,
but that doesn't help because every time

119
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:45,850
you put it off,
the anxiety just grows a little bit.

120
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,940
You're not proud of yourself.
You have a sense that you're making 

121
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,150
things more chaotic than they should be.
You know?

122
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,160
And if you do that long enough,
and I'm sure many of you have had that 

123
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,160
experience,
if you do that long enough,

124
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,571
if that becomes habitual,
things will get so stormy around you 

125
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:05,830
that you'll fall right into the,
into the chaos,

126
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,340
into the watery chaos,
and maybe you'll drown.

127
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,090
So it's not a very good idea to run from
your destiny.

128
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Let's say whatever that might be.
And you need a destiny.

129
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:25,091
You needed a place to aim at because 
that's what gives your life meaning and 

130
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:26,270
you need meaning in your life because 
life is hard.

131
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,990
So you know,
you need something to buttress yourself 

132
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:31,990
against that.
So anyways,

133
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:38,390
they wake Jonah and Jonah says hi.
It's probably my fault because like I'm 

134
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,940
running away from something I'm supposed
to do and you know,

135
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:43,941
God isn't very happy about that.
So why don't you just throw me over 

136
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:46,490
overboard.
And the crew isn't very happy about 

137
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,251
that,
but the waves are really starting to 

138
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:49,290
come up and join is pretty insistent 
that he's the cause of the problem.

139
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,620
And so they draw,
they draw lots and,

140
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:00,290
and Jonah is chosen.
And so they decided to toss them into 

141
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,210
the ocean and immediately everything's 
calm.

142
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,680
So he's a center of chaos because he's 
not doing what he's supposed to do.

143
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,610
Fine,
well then a whale comes up and swallows 

144
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,690
them.
Then he's in the whale for three days.

145
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,550
Now.
That's a weird thing.

146
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,650
The whale,
that's the way all the was in.

147
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,570
That's a dragon.
It's that thing that you have to go out 

148
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:30,570
there and conquer to get something of 
value.

149
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,100
Now,
when you've made an error,

150
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:37,070
when you've

151
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,880
fallen off the pathway,
when you deviated from what you know you

152
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:48,881
should do,
your produces a state of internal chaos 

153
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:49,970
and worry and concern.
You're.

154
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,600
You're thrust into the unknown.
You're thrust into unknown territory and

155
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,440
chaos.
You don't know what to do.

156
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,900
And that's often symbolized by the 
encounter with a,

157
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,240
with a monster like a dragon or 
something that lives under the water.

158
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,130
That's.
And I think the reason for that is,

159
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,610
as far as I've been able to tell,
is that human beings,

160
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:13,611
because we'd been prey animals for 
forever in her battle with carnivorous 

161
00:09:13,611 --> 00:09:14,220
lizards,
for example,

162
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:19,221
and alligators and even dinosaurs 
because there were dinosaurs around at 

163
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:23,121
the time of our most distant ancestors.
And there was even a cat at one point 

164
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:27,111
that was,
that was adapted with teeth to pierce 

165
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:30,240
human skulls.
So it had a head that was exactly shaped

166
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:34,950
to grab you here and put a two through 
the back of your skull.

167
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,200
So like we've come through some rough 
times,

168
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,330
man.
And we have,

169
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:44,331
uh,
a system in our mind that's a threat 

170
00:09:44,331 --> 00:09:47,780
Predator detection system.
That's the thing that makes little kids 

171
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,930
think about monsters in the dark,
right?

172
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,480
Because while there is monsters in the 
dark,

173
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,680
and parents always say,
well,

174
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:54,390
there's no monsters in the dark.
It's like,

175
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,390
that's not true.
The darkest full of monsters.

176
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,450
There might not be any in your room 
right at that moment,

177
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,860
but that doesn't mean there aren't 
monsters in the dark crimes.

178
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,890
Take place.
Like criminals don't get up at six in 

179
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,070
the morning and have breakfast and go 
rob a bank.

180
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,410
They do it,
they do that sort of thing at night.

181
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,710
People do the things that are fit for 
the night in the night and lots of 

182
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:25,010
predators are nocturnal and you can't 
see very well in the dark and kids 

183
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,000
aren't stupid.
You know,

184
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:31,130
they've evolved to stay pretty damn 
close to the fire because of the kids 

185
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:36,981
that wandered away from the fire got 
picked off by hyenas and lions and you 

186
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,320
know,
crocodiles and whatever else the hell 

187
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,560
was out there to eat the unwary.

188
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,340
So

189
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:55,060
the circuit that we use to defend 
ourselves against predators as we've 

190
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,880
evolved cortically that circuit has,
has come to represent what we don't know

191
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:05,690
in general because the predators of 
course inhabit where we don't know.

192
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,350
And so evolution is a conservative force
and we use the circuits that we've 

193
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:15,950
evolved to represent new things.
And so the unknown,

194
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,220
the chaos is often represented by a 
monster that swallows you up and pulls 

195
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,511
you down.
And you know when you're feeling 

196
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:25,511
terrible,
you don't say,

197
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:26,240
well,
I'm feeling up.

198
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,340
You say,
I'm feeling down,

199
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,420
well,
why is that?

200
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:30,920
Well

201
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,880
down is worse.
I guess you're flat on the ground when 

202
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:36,890
you're down or you're in a hole or 
something like that.

203
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:40,820
You're hiding in a hole.
You know it's down and you're threatened

204
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:45,821
by something you know.
Maybe you're threatened by your own 

205
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:46,040
inadequacy.
That might be part of it.

206
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:51,041
Maybe that's partly what you imagine as 
a monstrous force because you know your 

207
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:55,510
proclivity towards press procrastination
and your weakness of character is part 

208
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,301
and parcel of why you happen to be in 
the underworld and that's the 

209
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:02,320
underworld,
that mythological underworld.

210
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,610
That's where you go when things fall 
apart,

211
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,720
and if you understand that,
if you know that that's what that means,

212
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,930
then you have one of the keys that opens
up ancient stories to you and you 

213
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,300
understand things.
Your life can be an organized,

214
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,590
going very well,
and then something comes up and poof.

215
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,480
Everything changes.

216
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,890
Some axiom that you were living by it,
it might be the existence of a partner,

217
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,290
might be a job,
but might be your health.

218
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Any of those things go on and you go 
somewhere.

219
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,330
When that happens,
you go somewhere,

220
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,570
it's a state of being.
You're still in the same world,

221
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:46,750
but it's not the same at all anymore.
Everything about it is different.

222
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,930
It's all negative and dark and you don't
know what to do and you're confused and 

223
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:56,191
so what do you do down there in the 
underworld when things have fallen 

224
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,770
apart,
especially if if it's the worst possible

225
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:04,771
case scenario,
when you realize that you actually had 

226
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:05,530
something to do with your demise,
that's really annoying.

227
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,850
You know when something bad happens to 
you and then you know you grind yourself

228
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:13,810
into bits trying to figure out what the 
hell happened and then you realize that,

229
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,740
well,
you were playing a causal role.

230
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,980
Now sometimes you're so depressed.
You assume you're playing a causal role 

231
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,310
and your work.
It's not easy to figure out by any 

232
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,441
stretch of the imagination and it isn't 
that everyone who does something 

233
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,981
terrible is at fault for it,
but sometimes you find that you are off 

234
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:37,711
the path somehow and maybe even that you
knew it and he didn't attend to it and 

235
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:41,821
that's why all of this hit the fan.
And so then down there in that chaos,

236
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:47,610
you decide that you're going to do what 
you're supposed to do instead and then 

237
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:52,030
maybe you get to rise up again,
renewed if you're lucky,

238
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,660
and then you can go fix the city.
And that's what this story's about.

239
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,920
And that's why I picked the image to 
represent the chorus.

240
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:06,010
Because really what happens,
you see with the psychoanalysts,

241
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,920
the road due to health,
if you're not doing well,

242
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,440
which means that as you act in the 
world,

243
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:16,850
you're not getting what you want.
There's something wrong with your,

244
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,460
the match between your presuppositions 
and your actions,

245
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,610
habitual and the way the world is 
responding to you.

246
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,900
And so it's not turning out for you.
And the question is,

247
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,310
well,
what can you do about that?

248
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,060
And one answer might be to examine 
yourself for presuppositions and action 

249
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,891
patterns that are not serving you well 
and to find out what they are and what 

250
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:44,421
to do about them.
And maybe some of that is maybe you're 

251
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:46,970
not moving forward because of fear.
And maybe that's theory is grounded in 

252
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,481
terrible experiences that you had in the
past that you've never been able to 

253
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:53,451
understand and maybe one of the ways of 
yourself back together and expanding 

254
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:57,650
your personality so that you could in 
fact live properly in the world,

255
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,860
is to go back to those terrible events 
and untie them and straighten them out 

256
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:09,761
and understand them and drop them.
And that's what psychotherapy is about.

257
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:12,590
In large part,
psychoanalytic,

258
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,460
behavioral doesn't matter.
What are you afraid of?

259
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,070
What are you avoiding?
What are you failing to develop?

260
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,590
Maybe from fear,
maybe from avoidance,

261
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:23,750
God only knows maybe from disgust.

262
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,540
How can you get over it?
How can you reclaim those parts of your 

263
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:31,540
self.
