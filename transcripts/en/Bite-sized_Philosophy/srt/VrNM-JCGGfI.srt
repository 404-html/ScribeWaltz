1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,180
Okay,
so you see you don't see irrelevant 

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:05,940
things.
That's most things you do.

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:10,941
See things that move you forward and you
do see things that get in your way and 

4
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:14,520
in the class of things that get in your 
way are in determinant occurrences,

5
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:19,521
novel or anomalous occurrences,
and almost everything that gets in your 

6
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:23,121
way is in some sense a novel occurrence 
because you usually structure your 

7
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:27,231
behavior so that you don't go anywhere 
where something wildly anomalous is 

8
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:28,740
likely to occur,
so,

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,800
so not if you encountered an obstacle to
things happening at the same time and 

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,611
one is that your movement forward to 
your specific goal or sets of goals is 

11
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:41,991
blocked,
but the second thing that happens is 

12
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,830
you're faced with a mystery and the 
mystery is this thing wasn't supposed to

13
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:45,510
exist,
but it does exist.

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,300
So what implication does that have for 
everything?

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,980
I think,
and that's very,

16
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:54,981
very hard on people.
They do not like that at all and no 

17
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:54,981
wonder because it's,
it's,

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,040
it's the constrained chaos that's 
underneath everything inhibited by your 

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,301
contextual knowledge that suddenly 
popped its head up into your world.

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,490
It's like it's like the shark in the 
movie jaws,

21
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:12,120
which is of course a mythological story.
It's exactly that and,

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,360
and it's,
it's exactly what that movie signified,

23
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,810
a safe vacation paradise all of a sudden
threatened by some subterranean thing 

24
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:26,361
that can pull you down and and that 
destroys the peace and the harmony of 

25
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:27,840
that particular community to dragon 
story.

26
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:28,850
It's a hero myth.
It's,

27
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,560
it's the story that people have been 
telling forever,

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,740
so,
so what you can think,

29
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:36,750
you can think of that thing that 
re-emerges,

30
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,780
that shark that rises up from the depths
or that whale or that dragon or that 

31
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,860
Predator or or the foreign invader for 
that matter or the barbarian,

32
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:47,640
and they all fit into the same category.

33
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,940
That's what had been deemed irrelevant 
suddenly manifesting itself.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
And when you think about how much is 
deemed irrelevant,

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,090
the fact that it's suddenly manifests 
itself,

36
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,900
that's exactly the purpose for the 
reason for the,

37
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,580
for the trauma.
It's like,

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,270
well,
I've,

39
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,500
I've eradicated from my 
conceptualizations,

40
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,680
99 point nine,
nine percent of everything.

41
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,350
It's zeroed out and all of a sudden I've
made a mistake,

42
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,000
bang.
I don't know where I am.

43
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Well,
what's relevant when you don't know 

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,731
where you are and the answer to that is,
since you don't know everything is 

45
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:27,141
relevant and you can imagine the sort of
terror that people who experienced 

46
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:30,780
paranoid schizophrenia are living in 
perennially because what happens to them

47
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:35,781
is precisely that they undergo 
neurophysiological transformations that 

48
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:40,191
makes everything that they once depended
on disappear and everything comes back 

49
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:44,640
is relevant and that puts them in the 
early stages of schizophrenia.

50
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,310
That's extraordinarily stressful 
neurophysiologically,

51
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,520
so they're overwhelmed with cortisol and
their brains don't deteriorate as a 

52
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,380
consequence of that is just too much,
so unsurprisingly,

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,440
right?
Because you can't deal with.

54
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,330
You can deal with anything,
let alone with everything.

55
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,890
Now and often what you see,
and it's rarely conceptualized this way 

56
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,820
in,
in the training of of of clinical 

57
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,351
therapists,
but often what you see when you are 

58
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:16,600
dealing with people who are in crisis 
isn't people who have a mental illness.

59
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,250
In fact,
in my experience,

60
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:23,251
that's actually quite rare.
What's far more common is that the 

61
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:26,731
person that you're talking to has become
overwhelmed by catastrophe so their life

62
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,420
has fallen apart in some way that makes 
what they're doing actually impossible.

63
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,450
You know,
so maybe someone very close to them in 

64
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,450
their family that they were depending on
has developed a very serious illness and

65
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,930
that's throwing their entire financial 
state into utter chaos.

66
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,290
Or maybe they've developed a condition 
that makes it impossible for them to 

67
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,231
work or you know you can.
You can imagine the potential range of 

68
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:52,501
catastrophes and they're coming to see 
you because they're anxious and 

69
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:56,041
depressed,
but the reason they're anxious and 

70
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,610
depressed is because everything they 
have ignored has popped its head back up

71
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:02,611
and is hell bent on their destruction.
And often you see people who are being 

72
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:07,381
attacked by five or six of these 
monsters out at the same time and it 

73
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,820
isn't their mental illness that stops 
them from being able to deal with it.

74
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:10,930
Although that,
you know,

75
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,810
whatever weaknesses you have are going 
to interfere.

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,200
It's the fact that what they're facing 
is no damn joke.

77
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:20,050
And if you were facing it,
you'd feel exactly the same way.

78
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,410
So then you're trying to come up with 
practical solutions to these 

79
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:25,630
tremendously complex problems.

80
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,780
And that's a very,
a very well,

81
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:31,420
it's extraordinarily difficult.
Generally speaking,

82
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:36,421
people often don't come to a therapist 
until they've exhausted their entire 

83
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:39,220
range of resources.
They cannot figure out what to do.

84
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,260
And so,
you know,

85
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:46,261
in a situation like that you can 
administer antidepressants and maybe 

86
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:47,650
that'll help the person increase their 
stress resistance.

87
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,420
But as a,
uh,

88
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,510
and it may be that because they're 
depressed and have been brought down 

89
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,331
that they are in fact exaggerating the 
danger of some of the smaller monsters 

90
00:04:57,331 --> 00:05:01,351
that are after them,
but making the person more stress 

91
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:01,660
resilient doesn't give them,
for example,

92
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:06,661
a new job.
And it certainly doesn't bring back the 

93
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:09,301
person they've been living with for two 
years who has a degenerating 

94
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:09,970
neurological disease or some form of 
cancer.

95
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,520
Like these things are major.
You know,

96
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,760
I often see people who,
while they're in a relationship,

97
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,500
maybe they're rather isolated,
older,

98
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,400
older people.

99
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,850
One of the partners is dying in their 
entire financial situation has become 

100
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,961
catastrophic.
It's like that's not a mental illness 

101
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:32,161
man,
I mean they may have got into that 

102
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:32,170
situation because of one inadequacy or 
another,

103
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:37,171
but you don't even want to push that too
far because that sort of thing can 

104
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:40,621
happen to anyone and and will in fact 
happen to most people in one form or 

105
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:42,210
another at least at some point in their 
lives.

106
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:44,560
So you want to be damned prepared for 
that.

107
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,160
You want to be prepared for that because
it's bitter and harsh and anxiety 

108
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:55,621
provoking and painful,
but if you're not ready that it's also 

109
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,011
hell.
And often you can stop things from 

110
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:02,080
becoming hell even though you can't stop
them from being bitter and painful and 

111
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,660
anxiety provoking and all of that.
You can at least delimit the catastrophe

112
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,040
enough so that it doesn't permanently 
bring you and the people around you down

113
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,600
and that's,
that's not so bad,

114
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:11,840
right?

115
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,240
That's a hell or at least it's a lot 
better than the alternative.

116
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,200
So this is the problem.
You know,

117
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,080
things object things are obstacles.
Well,

118
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,270
how big is the obstacle?
It's the same.

119
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,800
It's the same question is how big is the
Predator that's lurking outside the door

120
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:32,801
of our cave?
It's exactly the same problem except 

121
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:36,671
construct,
conceptualized abstractly and and I 

122
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:39,281
would say exactly the same systems that 
you're distant ancestors used to 

123
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:43,871
conceptualize the lurking Predator are 
the systems that are activated now when 

124
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:47,660
you encounter the reemergence of all the
monsters that you've ignored,

125
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,900
it's the same neurological platform you 
think,

126
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,040
well,
how could it be otherwise?

127
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,850
Because evolution is a conservative 
process.

128
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,810
Everything about you is built on on 
ancient foundations,

129
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:01,010
right?
Very little new.

130
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,800
Certainly very little radically new 
comes into existence.

131
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:07,400
It's mostly tinkering with structures 
that have been around forever.

132
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:09,110
Like your body plan,
for example.

133
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:11,960
That's unbelievably old.
I mean you share that with.

134
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,210
You share that with lizards,
roughly speaking,

135
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,800
so it's incredibly ancient.
