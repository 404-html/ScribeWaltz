1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,060
You hear the gallon attarian clarion 
call everywhere.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,960
Everything should be equal.
Everything should be equally 

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:11,960
distributed.
We should strive for equity.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,690
It's like wrong,
especially if you're a conservative,

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,960
wrong.
What we want are just hierarchies of 

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,210
competence.
Not everyone's a neurosurgeon.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,450
You know,
if your father has a brain tumor,

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,630
you probably want a hierarchy of 
competence for neurosurgeons so you can 

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,220
pick the one that's the best so that he 
might not die.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,710
That's what a hierarchy of competence is
for.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,590
For the postmodernists,
there's no hierarchy that isn't based on

12
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:41,760
power.
Well,

13
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:46,761
because they think the world runs on 
power and that's why they're willing to 

14
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:48,870
use power to get what they want because 
it's the only thing they believe in,

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,540
but a valid hierarchy of competence.
It's God.

16
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,710
We need those things,
man.

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,100
We need the best plumbers.
We need the best contractors.

18
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:56,820
We need the best.

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,140
We knew we need the best carpenters,
we need the best lecturers.

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,290
There has to be a hierarchy of quality,
not only so that we know who the best 

21
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:11,871
are and can reward them properly,
but so that we can reward them so they 

22
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:12,180
keep being the best.
It's like you know if,

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,170
if you have a great educator,
if you have a great leader,

24
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,590
if you have a great thinker,
you want to reward them so they keep 

25
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,890
thinking and they keep educating so they
can tell you something.

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,560
It's not a reward for their intrinsic 
being.

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,770
It's a calculated move on your part to 
suck everything out of them that's 

28
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,900
valuable as fast as you can.
That's what a hierarchy of competence is

29
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:38,901
for and the idea is that hierarchies of 
competence don't exist is it's so 

30
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:43,341
cynical.
It's such a pathologically cynical idea 

31
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:46,490
and it's actually quite patently untrue 
because here's an interesting tidbit 

32
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:46,490
from the psychological literature.

33
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,360
Let's say you want to determine what the
best predictors are for lifetime success

34
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,490
in a Western society.
Well,

35
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:56,400
what would you hope for?
How about intelligence?

36
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,670
There'd be a good one.
Let's hope the smart people occupied 

37
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,910
more positions of complexity,
right?

38
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:06,810
Because they're smarter.
Do you want it any other way?

39
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,490
Okay,
and then so and that's great.

40
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,550
The number one predictor of 
accomplishment in western societies is 

41
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,270
intelligence.
So that means the system works.

42
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:18,660
What's the number to predictor 
conscientiousness?

43
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,500
Well,
what's that?

44
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:22,140
It's a trademark or for hard work.
So who?

45
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,350
Who gets ahead,
smart people who work hard now that 

46
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,851
doesn't account for every bit of the 
difference between people in terms of 

47
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,630
their hierarchical structure because 
hierarchies aren't perfect.

48
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:38,631
They're corrupt.
People get to the top sometimes because 

49
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:38,631
there's psychopathic,
although believe me,

50
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:42,981
a hell of a lot less than you think 
because a psychopath has to keep moving 

51
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:47,001
from place to place because once he 
reveals himself as deceitful and 

52
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:50,361
untrustworthy,
he has to go find new soccer's to 

53
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:50,361
fleece.

54
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:51,810
So the idea that you know,
there's no distinction between a CEO and

55
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:56,811
a psychopath.
It's like that's only made by someone 

56
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:59,630
who knows nothing about psychopaths be,
knows nothing about ceos and c has 

57
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:04,600
something fundamental against the entire
capitalist structure because it's simply

58
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,100
not true.
Corrupt,

59
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,150
sometimes greedy,
sometimes short,

60
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,210
shortsighted,
sometimes running companies that are 

61
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:14,210
doing their best to auger themselves 
into the ground.

62
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,040
And so,
you know,

63
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,680
it's bad people running a dying 
organization,

64
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,050
but generally speaking,
it's not the case.

65
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:25,051
Our hierarchies of competence are 
reasonably functional and not only are 

66
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:25,600
they functional,
they're valuable.

67
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,600
We need to know who the competent people
are and we need to reward them.

68
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:31,180
And even more importantly,
we need to tell young people,

69
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,510
hey,
there's some hierarchies of competence 

70
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:36,510
out there,
like a thousand of them.

71
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,830
Go be a plumber man,
but be a good one.

72
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:39,970
You know,
being honest.

73
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,740
One B,
I had a plumber once,

74
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:43,840
you know,
it was the night,

75
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,390
it was the night before we were putting 
drywall in our house.

76
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:49,810
We were redoing a house and he had put 
in all the plastic piping,

77
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:51,520
you know,
and I was going to test,

78
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:54,460
the joints are supposed to be glued 
together with his pipe glue.

79
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:55,540
Right?
And I said,

80
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,700
I told her I had to test the joints and 
he said,

81
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,110
well,
you don't have to test my joints.

82
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:00,160
They never leak.
And I thought,

83
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:01,390
yeah,
that's okay.

84
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,510
How about if I test them?
So I went up on the third floor and 

85
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,630
filled the pipes with water,
capping them in the basement like you're

86
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:10,180
supposed to.
Like half an hour later I had two inches

87
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:15,181
of water in the basement.
There were 30 leaking joints and that 

88
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:17,500
was the night before the drywallers were
supposed to show up so well.

89
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,530
So he wasn't particularly competent.
That's the point of that story.

90
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:25,531
But even more so he had put a bunch of 
the plastic pipe outside where the 

91
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:30,691
drywall would be.
So it would have been sticking through 

92
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:30,691
the wall.
So I spent a frenetic night,

93
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:34,750
you know,
sawing through plastic pipe and re 

94
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,860
gluing joints so that my.
So that the drywallers could come in.

95
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,170
What's the point?
If you're going to be a plumber,

96
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:43,171
man,
be a good plumber because otherwise all 

97
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:43,171
you do is go out there and cause 
trouble.

98
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:44,470
And we don't need people to cause more 
trouble.

99
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,050
We need people to solve problems,
you know?

100
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:48,940
And so you can be a tradesman and you 
can be,

101
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,660
you can make a lot of money as a trades 
person.

102
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:53,560
It's a bloody reliable,
honorable,

103
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,820
a forthright,
productive way of making a living and 

104
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,251
there is a hell of a lot of difference 
between a working man who knows what 

105
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:05,590
he's doing and one who doesn't,
both in terms of skill and ethics.

106
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,050
Right,
and you work with someone who knows what

107
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:09,370
they're doing.
It's a bloody pleasure.

108
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,700
They tell you what they're going to do,
they tell you how much it will cost.

109
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,880
They go and do it works and you pay them
perfect.

110
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,060
Everyone's happy and that's what happens
when you have genuine hierarchies of 

111
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,541
competence and so you to.
You listen to these panderers of 

112
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:24,541
egalitarianism,
a gallery,

113
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,570
egalitarianism,
equity,

114
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,750
and they failed to recognize completely 
that there are differences in rank 

115
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,660
between people.
It's not such a terrible thing,

116
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:33,970
man.
Maybe he wouldn't be a great lawyer like

117
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:36,100
it's certainly possible.
Most people aren't,

118
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,680
but that doesn't mean there isn't 
something you could be great at.

119
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:42,730
There's lots of hierarchies to attempt 
to climb and if you fail in one,

120
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,120
go try and another,
but the point is you're still trying to 

121
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,730
aim for the top and what the hell are 
you going to do?

122
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,860
If you don't try to aim for the top,
you know,

123
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,890
flap about uselessly and whine about 
your life,

124
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,920
it's not helpful.
It will just make you miserable.

125
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,410
You're not reliable to anyone.
You can't help out in a crisis.

126
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,710
It's like so you tell young people,
this is another message for 

127
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:05,710
conservatives like,
I don't care why you're going to do,

128
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,360
but go out there and make something of 
yourself for God's sake.

129
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:13,361
Be An honest person and work and get to 
the top of whatever it is that you want 

130
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:15,080
to get to the top of you know,
and,

131
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,900
and,
and,

132
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,240
and stand up for yourself like a 
respectable human being and be a bit of 

133
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,610
a light on the world instead of a 
blight.

134
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,120
You know,
and you can tell young people that and 

135
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,120
they haven't been told that by anyone 
now.

136
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,440
And so the young men are so hungry for 
that,

137
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:31,730
that it's,
it's painful to watch.

138
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,940
They're so relieved when finally someone
finally comes up and says,

139
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,720
Hey,
you know,

140
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,120
you,
you get your act together bit discipline

141
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:41,090
yourself.
See if you can learn to tell the truth,

142
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,980
concentrate on something for a year or 
two.

143
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,320
You could be a bloody world beater.
They think freely.

144
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,960
That's possible.
Wow.

145
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:49,670
That would be.
That would be interesting.

146
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,490
That might make life or life worth 
living.

147
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:53,360
It's like,
yeah,

148
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:55,820
it might.
So why don't you go do it now.

149
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,840
That's what the damn universities we're 
supposed to be teaching people and 

150
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,370
they've forgotten that.
I went to Harvard month ago,

151
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:06,371
month and a half.
I used to teach there and I talked to a 

152
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:06,371
bunch of students.
You know what I told them?

153
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,240
It's not easy to get into Harvard,
you know,

154
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,510
like you're a Valedictorian if you're at
Harvard and not only are you a 

155
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,260
Valedictorian,
you're way better than most people,

156
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:18,020
at least two other things or you don't 
get it.

157
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,230
And so that gets.
I don't know what the acceptance rate is

158
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:24,230
like five percent and believe me,
not everybody applies.

159
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:27,550
So it's a very selective school and so 
why am I saying that?

160
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:32,390
It's like these are high quality kids,
so I told them what I just told you.

161
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:34,310
It's like,
here you are at Harvard.

162
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,500
It's like get yourself educated,
man,

163
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,150
read some books,
learn to talk,

164
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:40,520
learn to think,
make yourself into something,

165
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,700
get the hell out there and make the 
world that put you here happy that you 

166
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,600
were put there in that great 
institution,

167
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,870
you know,
and they came up to me afterwards and 

168
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:52,870
said,
God,

169
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,100
I wish someone would have told us that 
when we were in our first year.

170
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,300
It's like,
Jesus,

171
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,090
why didn't someone tell them that for 
God's sake,

172
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:01,880
it's supposed to be the greatest 
university in the world.

173
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,090
Is it so difficult to figure that out?
Well,

174
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,180
it is.
If that is what you want to have happen 

175
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,581
in the university,
you want to make cringing milk sops who 

176
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:14,030
whined about being victims while they're
going to ivy league institutions.

177
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,100
Jesus,
it's pathetic.
