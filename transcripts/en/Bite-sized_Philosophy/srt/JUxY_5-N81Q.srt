1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,780
And you might say,
well,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,960
what's your evidence that those 
differences in personality aren't 

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,270
culturally constructed and the evidence 
for that,

4
00:00:07,271 --> 00:00:08,830
it's quite clear.
You can go online,

5
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:13,831
you look up the Scandinavian studies,
let's go online and look up gender 

6
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:14,430
differences in personality 
cross-culturally.

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:19,860
You'll find the relevant studies they've
been done with tens of thousands of 

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,771
people or something she'll write clearly
is in those societies where the most is 

9
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:26,980
being done to move,
move the social world into a position of

10
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:31,981
radical equality.
And so that would roughly be the 

11
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:32,320
Scandinavian countries because they've 
done more than that,

12
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:37,321
more of that than any other country.
The personality differences between men 

13
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:39,550
and women maximize,
they don't minimize,

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,810
they maximize.
And I'll say that again in the countries

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,260
where they're most has been done to 
equalize that playing field between men 

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,001
and women.
Men and women get more different rather 

17
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,211
than more of the same.
So for all your social constructionists 

18
00:00:57,211 --> 00:01:00,451
out there in the audience,
and there's probably not that many of 

19
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,591
you because you wouldn't come in here 
and be talked to her social 

20
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:02,591
constructionist.
You're actually wrong.

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,970
Yeah.
Well,

22
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:06,560
and the thing is,

23
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,070
thank you,

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,580
so one of the things you might be 
interested in is that it's all the same 

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,881
to me.
Subsets like when I was looking into 

26
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:27,670
this to begin with in this group started
probably 25 years ago,

27
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:31,000
looking at differences in personality 
between men and women,

28
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,390
you know,
it doesn't go at all whether they were 

29
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,070
fundamentally biological,
biological are fundamentally associate,

30
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:40,570
large boiler or mixed produced the 
differences,

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,590
you know,
no one knew and the most logical 

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,181
hypothesis was that as you need wise,
this society that men and women would 

33
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:50,830
become more of the same,
but that is not what happened.

34
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,950
And so we've actually looked at social 
constructionist hypothesis with regards 

35
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,490
to gender differences in insects and 
personality.

36
00:01:57,491 --> 00:02:02,491
We'll put that to the test and a very 
intense way and the social 

37
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:05,521
constructionist viewpoint fail.
So it's very strange because no one was 

38
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:05,870
already believed that,
right?

39
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,930
If you make this make society one of the
same in men and women get more 

40
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:10,930
different.
Sorry,

41
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,440
what's up with that?
Well,

42
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:15,310
the answer seems to be is that there's 
fundamentally two sources of variability

43
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:16,480
in personality,
right?

44
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,660
There's perhaps more,
but you can categorize them as roughly 

45
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,140
genetic and roughly sociological.
Well,

46
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:28,141
if you take out all the sociological 
differences between the landscape in 

47
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:32,761
which men and women are raped and all 
you have left are the biological and 

48
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:33,580
genetic differences,
so they maximize,

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,140
well,
that's exactly what happened.

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,200
This actually matters.
It really matters and this is why that 

51
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,860
demands for equity or so.
Well,

52
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,950
there's 15 reasons why demands for 
equity order on this is between men and 

53
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,161
women should not be overlooked.
Partly because it's wrong to overlook 

54
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:51,460
the junior with differences between men 
and women.

55
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:54,220
It's not good for the man.
It's not good for the women.

56
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,590
So one of the things you see in 
Scandinavia,

57
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:59,050
for example,
is there's an overwhelming preponderance

58
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,110
female nurses and there's an 
overwhelming preponderance of male 

59
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,540
engineers and actually the data on,
on personality differences.

60
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,360
Um,
there's,

61
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,410
there's,
there's the standard traits which will 

62
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:14,410
continue to go through.
I can do that quite quickly.

63
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,040
There's no much difference in trait 
conscientiousness between men and women.

64
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,730
If you break it down into the aspects,
women are a bit more orderly than men,

65
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,130
but there's no difference in 
industriousness and then with regards to

66
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:29,050
openness,
which is the intelligence,

67
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,130
intellect,
creativity,

68
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:35,131
dimension overall,
there's no difference between men and 

69
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:35,131
women,
but if you break it up into the aspects,

70
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,820
then the differences are actually quite 
pronounced.

71
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:41,380
So what you have is the openness to 
experience is the technical trade and it

72
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,560
roughly breaks down into something 
that's sort of like created creativity 

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,831
and aesthetic interests versus the 
interest in ideas and what you see is 

74
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:53,821
that women are a third of the standard 
deviation higher than men in terms of of

75
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,730
creativity and aesthetic aesthetic 
proclivity,

76
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:02,731
let's say,
and men or month or the standard 

77
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:04,240
deviation higher than women in terms of 
interest in ideas and it's not a trivial

78
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,830
difference and it makes a difference.

79
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,280
So,
but the biggest difference between men 

80
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,291
and women as it turns out,
and this is almost one standard 

81
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:13,410
deviation,
which is a wall of indifference.

82
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,420
You never see that in social sciences 
and massive difference is the difference

83
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:21,880
between difference in interest and the 
masculine interest.

84
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,430
Roughly speaking is in face and the 
female interest,

85
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,550
roughly speaking is in people and that's
what underlies the differences say in,

86
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,630
in,
in career choice preference between 

87
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,241
things like nursing and psychology and 
social work and that sort of thing and 

88
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:37,290
engineering.
And uh,

89
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,530
because engineering is perhaps the most 
male oriented about the disciplines and 

90
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,570
the evidence that that's a sociological 
is very,

91
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:46,240
very unique.
