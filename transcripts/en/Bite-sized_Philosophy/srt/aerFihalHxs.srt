00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,400
Hello,
so we should first decide what we're 

2
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:13,881
talking about.
We're not talking about my views of 

3
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:17,631
political correctness despite what you 
might have inferred from the last 

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,850
speaker's comments.
This is how it looks to me.

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,930
We essentially need something 
approximating a low resolution grant 

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,370
narrative to unitus and and we did 
narrative tonight is because otherwise 

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:36,291
we don't have peace.
What's playing out in the universities 

8
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:41,240
and in broader society right now is a 
debate between two fundamental low 

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,081
resolution narratives.
Neither of which can be completely 

10
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:45,210
accurate because they can't encompass 
all the details.

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,420
Obviously human beings have an 
individual element and a collective 

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:50,420
element,
a group element.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,850
Let's say the question is what story 
should be paramount,

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,420
and this is how it looks to me in the 
West.

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,130
We have reasonably functional,
reasonably free,

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,460
remarkably productive stable hierarchies
that are open to consideration of the 

17
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:12,930
dispossessed that hierarchies generally 
create.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Our societies are freer and functioning 
more effectively than any societies,

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,320
anywhere else in the world and that and 
then any societies ever have and as far 

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,341
as I'm concerned,
and I think there's good reason to 

21
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:30,561
assume this,
it's because the fundamental low 

22
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:32,841
resolution,
a grand narrative that we've oriented 

23
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:36,681
ourselves around in the West is one of 
the sovereignty of the individual and 

24
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,510
it's predicated on the idea that all 
things considered the best way for me to

25
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:44,511
interact with someone else's individual 
to individual and to react to that 

26
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:48,501
person as if they're both part of the 
process because that's the right way of 

27
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:53,931
thinking about it.
The psychological process by which 

28
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:54,630
things we don't understand can yet be 
explored and buy.

29
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:58,200
Things that aren't properly organized in
our society can be yet set.

30
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:03,201
Right,
and the reason we're valuable as 

31
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:05,271
individuals,
both with regards to our rights and 

32
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:05,670
responsibilities,
is because that's our essential purpose.

33
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,340
Announce our nobility and that's our 
function.

34
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:14,150
What's happening as far as I'm concerned
in the universities in particular and 

35
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,120
spreading very rapidly out into the 
broader world,

36
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,160
including the corporate world,
much to.

37
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:22,161
It's a much to what should be its 
chagrin is a collectivist narrative and 

38
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:27,140
of course there's some utility in a 
collectivist narrative because we're all

39
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,150
part of groups in different ways,
but the collectivist narrative that I 

40
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,260
regard as politically correct as a 
pastiche of a strange pastiche of 

41
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,960
postmodernism in neo Marxism in its 
fundamental claim is that no,

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,200
you're not essentially an individual.
You're essentially a member of a group 

43
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,260
and that group might be your ethnicity 
and it might be your sex and it might be

44
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:54,261
a race and it might be any of the 
endless numbers of other potential 

45
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:58,251
groups that you belong to because you 
belong to many of them and that you 

46
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:01,090
should be essentially categorized with 
those who are like you on that dimension

47
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:01,870
in that group.

48
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,870
That's proposition number one.
Proposition number two is that the 

49
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,171
proper way to view the world is as a 
battleground between groups of different

50
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:15,211
power.
So you define the groups first and then 

51
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:15,211
you assume that you,
you,

52
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:17,200
you view the individual from the group 
context.

53
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:22,201
You viewed the battle between groups 
from the group context and you view 

54
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,771
history itself as a consequence of 
nothing but the power maneuvers between 

55
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:29,470
different groups that eliminates any 
consideration of the individual and at a

56
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:33,340
very fundamental level and also any 
idea,

57
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:38,341
for example,
of free speech because if you're 

58
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:40,000
collectivist at heart in this manner,
there is no such thing as free speech.

59
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,540
It isn't that it's debated by those on 
the radical left and let's say the rest 

60
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,890
of us so to speak.
It's that in that formulation there's no

61
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:52,891
such thing as free speech because for an
individualist free speech is how you 

62
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:54,460
make sense of the world and reorganize 
society in a proper manner,

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,750
but for the radical left type 
collectivist that's associated with this

64
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:01,150
viewpoint of political correctness,
when you speak,

65
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:06,210
all you're doing is playing a power game
on behalf of your group and there's 

66
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,040
nothing else that you can do because 
that's all there is and not only is that

67
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,820
all there is in terms of who you are as 
an individual now and how society should

68
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,270
be viewed.

69
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,640
It's also the fundamental narrative of 
history.

70
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,100
For example,
it's widely assumed in our universities 

71
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,820
now that the best way to conceptualize 
Western civilization is as an oppressive

72
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,850
male dominated patriarchy and that the 
best way to construe relationships 

73
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,691
between men and women across the 
centuries is one of oppression of women 

74
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,650
by men as well.
Look,

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,870
no hierarchy is without it's tyranny 
outside.

76
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,100
That's an axiomatic truth.
People have recognized that literally 

77
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,891
for thousands of years and hierarchies 
do tend towards tyranny and they tend 

78
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:51,750
towards the use of patient by people 
with power,

79
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,870
but that only happens when they become 
corrupt and we have mechanisms in our 

80
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,920
society to stop hierarchies from 
becoming intolerable,

81
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:02,700
be corrupted,
actually work pretty well and so and so.

82
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:04,470
I would also,
I would also.

83
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,690
I would also point this out,
you know,

84
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:12,170
don't be thinking that this is a debate 
about whether empathy is useful or not 

85
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,430
or that the people on the con side of 
the argument are not empathetic.

86
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,340
I know perfectly well as I insured,
Mr Frye does that.

87
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,760
Hierarchies tend to produce situations 
where people stack up at the bottom and 

88
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,780
that the dispossessed and hierarchies 
need a political voice,

89
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:26,680
which is the proper voice of the left by
the way,

90
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:31,681
and the necessary voice of the left,
but that is not the same as proclaiming 

91
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:35,931
that the right level of analysis for our
grand unifying narrative is that all of 

92
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:40,371
us are fundamentally to be identified by
the groups that we belong to and to 

93
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:45,261
construe the entire world as the 
battleground between different forms of 

94
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:49,791
tyranny in consequence of that group 
affiliation and to the degree that we 

95
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,410
play out that narrative that won't be 
progress.

96
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:57,411
Believe me,
and we certainly haven't seen that 

97
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:58,350
progress in the universities.
We've seen situations like what happened

98
00:05:58,351 --> 00:06:00,510
at Wilfrid laurier university.
Instead,

99
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,540
we won't see progress.
What will return to is exactly the same 

100
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,120
kind of tribalism to characterize the 
left.

101
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,690
Thank you.
