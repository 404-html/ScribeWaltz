1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,810
On,
um,

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,560
is there ever a legitimate use for human
rights tribunal or counsel?

3
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:09,561
And if you could comment also,
I'm going forward in the fight over 

4
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:12,630
gender expression,
gender identity,

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,380
um,
how do people combat or,

6
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:16,920
or,
or,

7
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:19,110
or win that fight in front of human 
rights?

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,130
Uh,
courts and tribunals and um,

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:23,730
yeah,

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,140
we'll leave it at that.
Oh no,

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,670
there is no excuse for them.
That's why they're called social justice

12
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:35,670
tribunals in Ontario like that.
That's what they're called.

13
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:37,920
And so look it up yourself and that's 
what they are.

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,100
So we had a court system that works 
perfectly well,

15
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,130
which doesn't mean it worked very well,
but it means it works better than any 

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,461
alternative.
And if anyone has ever been able to 

17
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:51,561
think up and a human rights tribunal can
suspend nor normal jurisprudential 

18
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:53,550
standards,
they use preponderance of evidence.

19
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:58,551
They don't assume individual innocence 
and they can change the rules as they 

20
00:00:58,551 --> 00:01:03,261
see fit.
And so those bloody things are 

21
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,661
pathological to the core and their,
their mouthpieces of the postmodernist 

22
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:09,801
neo Marxists as far as I'm concerned.
And they're setting up a parallel law 

23
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:09,960
system and they're also doing that

24
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,340
there also,
and this is,

25
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:20,210
this is the wind government,
they're also forcing the universities to

26
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:24,530
adopt particular definitions of sexual 
harassment that make every,

27
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,090
let's call it complicated interchange 
between human beings into a act of 

28
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:33,770
violence.
Not that I'm trying to justify stupidity

29
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:38,771
or oppression,
but we're all stupid and we're all 

30
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:41,691
oppressors.
And so the probability that we'll make 

31
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:43,931
some sort of dopey sexual error is 100 
percent and now that's become grounds 

32
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:44,870
for,
you know,

33
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:49,871
accusations of rape and where they're 
forcing the universities and the 

34
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:51,350
colleges to become parallel legal 
systems as well.

35
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,680
And that's already well advanced.
It's already been adopted at the UFT.

36
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,980
It's as a consequence of direct 
legislation and you better look out 

37
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,830
because even if the people who are 
running those institutions right now are

38
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,480
reasonable,
which they're not,

39
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,630
they will absolutely be replaced by 
people who exactly want that kind of 

40
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,090
power and will absolutely use it.
So no,

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,390
those things should be abolished.
We have a legal system,

42
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:20,920
no

43
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,670
law society now.
I may not have this exactly right,

44
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:29,671
but I've got it mostly right.
The Lost Society in Ontario has already 

45
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:33,001
decided that lawyers are racists.
They're going to force them to undergo 

46
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:36,361
on unconscious bias training and they've
come to and they were agreeing by the 

47
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:39,811
way they've already come to the 
conclusion that because the legal 

48
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:43,561
profession does not have the precise 
representation that you would expect if 

49
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:47,341
you did a demographic analysis of the 
population according to the terms 

50
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:50,410
defined by the social justice warriors,
that it's racist and that they're racist

51
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:53,470
and that they need to be trained 
unconscious first.

52
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:54,760
It's like,
so go ahead.

53
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:57,850
Lawyers like lineup man,
admit your guilt.

54
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,170
You're done and you deserve it too.
So yeah.
