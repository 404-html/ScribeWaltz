1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,380
I think that fundamentalists and 
atheistic scientists have the same 

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:11,610
problem,
the fundamentalists,

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,700
so we could say the Christian 
fundamentalists in the US make the 

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,510
proposition that biblical stories,
we'll call them mythological stories,

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,090
are literal representations of the 
truth,

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,050
but,
and that might be true depending on what

7
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:33,051
you mean by literal,
but what they mean by literal over what 

8
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:36,471
they attempt to make literal mean is 
that they're in the same category of 

9
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:39,481
scientific facts because they don't have
the idea that there are different ways 

10
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:45,000
of approaching truth and the truth can 
serve different purposes.

11
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:50,001
They don't have a sense that your 
definition of truth is actually 

12
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:53,541
something like a tool rather than an 
ontological statement about the reality 

13
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:53,760
of the world.
And so the.

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,960
The fundamentalists basically make the 
proposition that the idea that God 

15
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:01,200
created the world in six days,
5,000

16
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:05,160
years ago is literally true and they get
the 5,000

17
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:06,540
year estimate.

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,540
By the way,
by going through the genealogies in the 

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,120
Old Testament and adding up the 
hypothetical ages and figuring out.

20
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:17,410
You know how long before Moses Adam 
lived and some bishop did that back in 

21
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:20,070
the.
I think it was in the mid 18 hundreds,

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,220
I might be wrong about that,
but it was somewhere back about that 

23
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,510
time and more or less that's been 
accepted as canonical fact ever since,

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,610
and then the scientists say,
well,

25
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:31,260
yeah,
those are empirical truth.

26
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,430
They're just wrong.
See,

27
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,540
and that's the only difference there is 
between the fundamentalists and the 

28
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,161
atheist scientists,
the fundamental say those are 

29
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:41,040
fundamental scientific truths and 
they're right and the scientists say,

30
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,320
well,
their scientific truths,

31
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,370
they just happened to be wrong.
Well,

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,120
I think that's a stupid argument 
personally.

33
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,160
I mean for a bunch of reasons.
One is that the people who wrote the,

34
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,320
the ancient stories that we have access 
to,

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,280
we're in no way shape or form 
scientists,

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
you know,
modern people tend to think that you 

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
think like a scientist and people have 
always thought that way.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,080
First of all,
you do not think like a scientist.

39
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,780
Even scientists hardly even think like 
scientists,

40
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:11,610
but if you're not scientifically 
trained,

41
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,060
you don't think like a scientist at all.
So one of the things,

42
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:20,061
for example,
that characterizes your thinking is 

43
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:20,061
confirmation bias.
And so if you have a theory,

44
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,760
what you do is wander around in the 
world looking for reasons why it's true,

45
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,110
and the scientists does exactly the 
opposite of that in the little tiny,

46
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:33,111
narrow domain where he or she is 
actually capable of being a scientist 

47
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,190
and what they have is a theory and 
looked for a way to prove it wrong.

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,320
But believe me,
you don't run around doing that.

49
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,860
I mean you,
you can train yourself so now and then 

50
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:42,860
you can do that,
you know,

51
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,260
we can learn to listen to people,
for example,

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,330
on the off chance that you might be 
wrong,

53
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,940
but that is by no means a natural way of
thinking.

54
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,790
And of course the,
the,

55
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,220
the fundamental philosophical axioms of 
the scientific method weren't developed 

56
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:00,280
until descartes and,
and who else?

57
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,400
Descartes.
Bacon is one more.

58
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,980
Anyways,
the name escapes me at the moment,

59
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:08,560
but you can argue about when science 
emerged,

60
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,830
but you,
you,

61
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,280
it certainly emerged in it's articulated
form within the last thousand years.

62
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,730
I think you could say even more 
specifically that had emerged in the 

63
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,790
last 500 years.
Now you might argue with that and say,

64
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:26,791
well,
what about the Greeks and other people 

65
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,381
who were fairly technologically 
sophisticated or who invented geometry 

66
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:29,500
or that kind of thing,
but yeah,

67
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:33,340
yeah,
bear precursors to the idea of empirical

68
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:34,810
observation.
Aristotle,

69
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:39,811
for example,
when he was writing down his knowledge 

70
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:42,541
of the world,
it never occurred to him to actually go 

71
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,360
out in the world and look at it to see 
if what he assumed about it was true and

72
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:48,361
it certainly never occurred to Aristotle
to get 20 people to go look at the same 

73
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:50,110
thing independently.

74
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,260
Write down exactly how they went about 
doing it,

75
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,770
compare the records,
and then extract out what was common and

76
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:01,771
that's a.
That seems self evident to us to some 

77
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:02,180
degree,
but you know,

78
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,770
it was by no means self evident to 
anyone 500 years ago and people still 

79
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,850
don't do it.
So it's not even.

80
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,030
It's not plausible.
If you know anything about the history 

81
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,180
of ideas,
it's not plausible to pause it.

82
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:21,181
That stories about the nature of reality
that existed before 500 years ago were 

83
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:25,240
scientific at any but the most cursory 
of ways.

84
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,650
So why we have that argument continually
somewhat beyond me.

85
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,520
Part of the reason is though that 
everyone fundamentalists included really

86
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:39,250
believe in scientific facts.
Even though they hate it,

87
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,050
they'll use computers,
they'll fly,

88
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,290
computers won't work,
wouldn't work unless quantum mechanics 

89
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,141
were correct,
like the fact that you use a high tech 

90
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:53,551
device indicates through your action 
that you actually accept the theories 

91
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:55,000
upon which is predicated,
right?

92
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,210
Same as flying the same as anything you 
do in it too.

93
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:00,730
Complex Technological Society,
you're stuck with it.

94
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,260
You're reading by the lights.
Do they work?

95
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,550
Yeah,
they work well,

96
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,060
so it's really hard for people who are 
trying to hold onto a way of looking at 

97
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:14,341
the world that appears to contradict the
scientific claims when everything they 

98
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,670
do is predicated on their acceptance of 
the validity of the scientific claims.

99
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,840
It's really problematic for people and 
it's problematic in a real way,

100
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:27,841
I think because one of the problems with
the scientific viewpoint is it doesn't 

101
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:29,230
tell you anything about what you should 
do with your life.

102
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,890
It doesn't.
It doesn't solve the problem of value at

103
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:34,330
all.
In fact,

104
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:39,331
it might make it more difficult because 
one of the fundamental scientific 

105
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:39,580
claims,
roughly speaking,

106
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:42,250
is that every fact is of an equal 
utility,

107
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,380
at least from a scientific perspective.

108
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,050
Right?
There is no hierarchy facts.

109
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,140
It's not exactly.
That's not exactly true because you can 

110
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,710
think of one theory is more true than 
another,

111
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,980
but that boils down to saying that it's 
more useful than.

112
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,480
So I don't think that that's a really 
good exception.

113
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,890
Okay,
so fine.

114
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,880
You got the scientific atheist,
so on one end,

115
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:09,881
and you got the religious 
fundamentalists on the other and what 

116
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:09,881
they both agree on whether they like it 
or not,

117
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:13,940
is that there's so much power in the 
scientific method that it's difficult to

118
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:18,941
dispute the validity of scientific facts
and they seem to exist in contradiction 

119
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:23,740
to the older archaic stories.
If you also accept them as fast fact 

120
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,380
based account.
So what do we do about that?

121
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,840
Well,
if you're on a scientific atheist end of

122
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:30,950
things,
you say,

123
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:35,951
well,
those old stories or just superstitious 

124
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:35,951
science,
second rate,

125
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:38,570
barbaric archaic forms of science,
you just dispense with them.

126
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:41,720
They're nothing but trouble and if 
they're on their fundamentalist side you

127
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:42,110
say,
well,

128
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:45,260
we'll try to shoe horn science into this
framework.

129
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:50,261
And really that doesn't work very well.
It doesn't work very well with the 

130
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:50,261
claims of evolution.
For example,

131
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:54,870
fact it works very badly and that's a 
problem because evolutionary theory is 

132
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,660
like,
it's a killer theory and it's re,

133
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,240
it's,
it's really,

134
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:04,241
really hard and like it's not a complete
theory and there's lots of things we 

135
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:04,241
don't know about evolution,

136
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:05,740
you know,

137
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,560
trying to wear hand wave that away.
That's,

138
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,950
that's not gonna work without dispensing
with most of biology.

139
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,740
So.
So that's a big problem.

140
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,770
So here's another way of thinking about 
it.

141
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,880
You don't just need one way of looking 
at the world.

142
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,020
Maybe you need two ways of looking at 
the world and I'm not exactly sure how 

143
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,171
they should be related to one another.
Like which should take precedence under 

144
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:37,350
which circumstances,
but one problem is what's the world made

145
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:39,030
of,
you know,

146
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,690
what's the world conceptualized as an 
objective place made of.

147
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,830
And the other is how should you conduct 
yourself while you're alive?

148
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,820
And there's no reason to assume that 
those questions can be answered using 

149
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:54,330
the same approach.

150
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,230
I mean

151
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,040
physics has its methods and chemistry 
has its methods and biology has its 

152
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,401
methods,
so a method for obtaining the truth can 

153
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:11,231
be bound to a domain.
So why would we necessarily assume that 

154
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:15,281
you could use the same set of tools to 
represent the world as a place of 

155
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:18,860
objects and to represent it as a place 
in which a biological creature would act

156
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,570
in anyways.
I'm suggesting that we,

157
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,280
that we don't view it that way,
that we have two different viewpoints.

158
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,450
Maybe they can be brought together,
although it's not obvious how,

159
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,690
but that it's not a tenable solution to 
get rid of one in favor of the other.

160
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,130
And I think the reason for that is

161
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,650
you need to know how to conduct yourself
in the world.

162
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,860
You have to have a value system.
You can't even look at the damn world 

163
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,250
without a value system.
It's not possible.

164
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,290
Your emotional health is dependent on a 
value system.

165
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,290
The way you interact with other people 
is dependent on a value system.

166
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,500
There's no getting away from it.
And you say,

167
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:06,501
well,
there's no justification for any value 

168
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:08,931
system from a scientific perspective.
You're going to draw that conclusion 

169
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:10,500
that no value system is valid.
Where the hell does that leave you?

170
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,020
There is no down,
there's no APP,

171
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,900
there's no rationale for moving in any 
direction.

172
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,210
There's not even really any rationale 
for living.

173
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:20,270
And so people say things like that,
well why?

174
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,620
Why the hell should I care what happens 
in a million years?

175
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:24,030
Who's going to know the difference?
It's like,

176
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:24,990
yeah,
yeah,

177
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,930
true,
stupid but true.

178
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,560
And the reason I think it's stupid is 
because it's just a game,

179
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:33,830
you know,
I can take anything of any sort,

180
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:35,730
can find a context in which it's 
irrelevant.

181
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,750
It's just a rational games like who 
cares if a hundred children freeze to 

182
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,750
death in a blizzard,
who,

183
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,730
what difference is going to make a 
billion years?

184
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:46,650
Well,
what do you say to someone who says that

185
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,310
you say,
well,

186
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,430
seems like the wrong frame of Reference 
Bucko.

187
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,040
That's what it looks like to me.
You know,

188
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,040
because at some point you question the 
dam frame of reference,

189
00:09:56,041 --> 00:10:01,041
not what you derive from it.
And it certainly seems to me that 

190
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,950
situations like that don't allow you to 
use that kind of frame of reference.

191
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:09,000
There's something inhumane about it and 
that trumps the logic,

192
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:11,280
or at least it should.
And if it doesn't,

193
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:16,281
then all hell breaks loose.
And that doesn't seem to be a good 

194
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:16,281
thing.
