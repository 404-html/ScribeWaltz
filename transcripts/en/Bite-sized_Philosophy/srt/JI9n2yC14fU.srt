1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,990
Okay,
here's the rats and this is from Yak 

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:05,990
Panksepp's work,
right?

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,730
He was the first guy who figured out the
rest giggle and you might think,

4
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:13,731
well,
what kind of stupid thing is that to 

5
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:13,731
study?
It's like $50,000

6
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:13,731
research grant for giggling rats,
you know,

7
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:17,890
so.
But he discovered the place circuitry in

8
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:20,040
mammals.
That's a big deal,

9
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:25,041
right?
It's like discovering a whole new 

10
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:25,041
continent.
There's a place circuit in mammals.

11
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,880
It's built right in.
So it's not socially constructed.

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,520
There's A.
There's a biological platform for that.

13
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:30,600
And so what?
What?

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,650
What panksepp would do with rats,
he found out if rats,

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,420
if you take a rat pup away from its 
mother,

16
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:38,130
it dies.
Even if you feed it,

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,720
even if it keep it warm,
it dies.

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,930
Now you can stop it from dying by taking
a pencil with an eraser on the end and 

19
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,030
massaging it right?
Because rats won't live without love.

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,280
And the same thing happens to human 
babies.

21
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:55,281
And we saw that in Romania when there 
was that catastrophe have to Chesko in 

22
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:59,211
the orphanages were the orphanages were 
full of unwanted babies because Joe 

23
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:00,600
Chesko insisted that every Romanian 
women was constantly pregnant.

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,900
So the orphanage just stacked up with 
unwanted babies and lots of them didn't 

25
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,120
even have names and they were 
warehoused.

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,370
Warmth,
shelter,

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,470
food,
devastating.

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,470
Lots of them died.
Most of them died before the first year.

29
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,590
And the ones that didn't die,
we're permanently dysfunctional because 

30
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,370
you have to be touched.
If you're a human being,

31
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,680
it's not an option you have to be played
with.

32
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,980
It's not an option,
it's,

33
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,030
it's part of neurodevelopmental 
necessity.

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,430
And,
and you have to also play fair,

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,700
so because otherwise you produce a very 
disjointed child who isn't able to 

36
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,150
engage in the niceties of social 
interaction,

37
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:39,090
which is continual play in some sense in
reciprocity.

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,440
So what Panksepp did with his wrath,
he noticed the male rats,

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,560
juveniles really liked to wrestle and 
they wrestle just like humans beings 

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,151
wrestle.
They pin each other for crying out loud 

41
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:53,151
with like that,
that have just lost.

42
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:53,430
He's down for a 10 count.
Right?

43
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,790
And so,
so what do you do is you take juvenile 

44
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,281
routes and you can find out that they 
want to play because you can attach a 

45
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,360
spring to the and then they'll try to 
run and you can measure how hard they're

46
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,370
running by,
how hard they're pulling on the spring 

47
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:10,370
and then you can estimate how motivated 
they are.

48
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,750
And so you can find out that a nice,
well fed rat who doesn't have anything 

49
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,700
on his mind will still work hard to play
if it,

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,430
to enter a,
an arena where he's been allowed to play

51
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,780
before,
he'll work for that.

52
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:26,781
So then you think,
well the rats motivated so the two rats 

53
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:27,500
go out there and they play and,
and so they're,

54
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:30,700
they're playing like dogs play and 
everyone knows what that looks like.

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,670
If you're,
you know,

56
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,680
if you have any sense about dogs that 
kind of go like this and kids do that 

57
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,731
and maybe you do that with your wife if 
you're going to play with her a little 

58
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:41,670
bit.
My poor wife man,

59
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,360
when she,
she was,

60
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:46,220
uh,
she was uh,

61
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,820
uh,
a young.

62
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,120
She had older siblings and so she wasn't
played with as much when she was little,

63
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:52,420
as she might've been in.
Um,

64
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,660
I used to like,
you know,

65
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,240
if you take a pillow and you go like 
this three times,

66
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:02,241
right?
That means look out a pillow is coming 

67
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:02,241
your way.
So I go one,

68
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:02,241
two,
three.

69
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:03,820
Wow.
When she looked,

70
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:05,800
she was completely dismayed and he's 
like,

71
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,420
what do you do that for?
And I thought,

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,980
well,
I eventually tartar that rule.

73
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,010
The other thing I used to,
the other thing I used to do,

74
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:23,641
you know,
is sometimes she'd come out and be like 

75
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:26,071
this when we were playing around and I 
grabbed her wrist and I know Parker her 

76
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:30,960
hands through her knuckles together and 
she used to just get completely annoyed 

77
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,460
about that and I thought,
right,

78
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,060
that's what you do.
You just open your hands.

79
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:41,061
While she didn't know that either.
So she hadn't been played with enough 

80
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:41,061
when she was a little rat.

81
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:41,760
So

82
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,730
anyways.
Anyways,

83
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,140
so you let the route,
the little rats go out there.

84
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:53,141
Right.
And so let's imagine one of them is 10 

85
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:54,971
percent bigger than the other.
And so that 10 percent bigger wins 

86
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:59,650
because 10 percent is enough in rat wait
to ensure that you're going to be the 

87
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,590
pinner rather than the penny.
Okay?

88
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:02,000
So.
So that's fine.

89
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:05,840
So when the rat,
the rat pins the pins a little route and

90
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:08,690
now the big rat is the is the authority 
rat.

91
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,200
And so then the next time that the rats 
play,

92
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,630
the little rat has to invite the big rat
to play.

93
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:17,930
So the big rats out there being cool and
a little rat pops up and you know,

94
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:19,730
does the whole will you play with me 
thing?

95
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,860
And the big rat will deign to play with 
them.

96
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,190
But if you pair them repeatedly,
unless the big rat lets the little rat 

97
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,761
win,
30 percent of the time the little rat 

98
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:30,761
will not invite him to play.

99
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:31,640
And panksepp discovered that.
It's like,

100
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:33,440
I read that.
That just blew me away.

101
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,980
It's like,
that is so amazing because you see walls

102
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:42,010
first of there,
there's an analogy to Piaget's ideas 

103
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,740
about the emergence of morality out of 
play in human beings.

104
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:47,741
So that was very cool.
But the notion that that was built into 

105
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:49,010
rats at the level of wrestling was,
and they're social,

106
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,480
they're deeply social animals,
right?

107
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:55,481
They have to know how to get along with 
one another and most of their authority 

108
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:55,610
disputes,
dominance,

109
00:04:55,611 --> 00:05:00,611
dispute.
You don't want them to end in bloodshed 

110
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:02,210
and combat because you know,
if your rag one and two and we tear each

111
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:07,211
other just threat shreds and the 
dominance dispute rack three is just 

112
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:08,600
going to move in.
It's really not a great strategy.

113
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:11,450
And so it'd be better if we could settle
our differences,

114
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:14,280
you know,
somewhat peacefully and so while.

115
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,860
So rats.
Anyways,

116
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,790
panksepp figured out that rats plan,
not only do they play,

117
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,470
they play fair and they seem to enjoy 
it.

118
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,600
He also figured out,
this was really cool too,

119
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,340
that if you give juvenile rats attention
deficit disorder drugs,

120
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,520
Ritalin suppresses,
pray,

121
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,610
play.
So that's worth thinking about.

122
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,030
It's like,
well,

123
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:40,031
why do you have to give juvenile human 
beings amphetamines in school?

124
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,760
Well,
because they need to play.

125
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,500
Well you don't,
you don't get to play.

126
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,210
They don't get to wrestle around.
I mean,

127
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:50,600
that's oppression as far as I can tell.
They don't get to wrestle around.

128
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,790
That's fine.
Feed him some amphetamines,

129
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:57,791
man.
That'll shut down the old place 

130
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:57,791
circuits.
Well,

131
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,221
here's the other problem is Panksepp 
found that if you don't let juvenile 

132
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:03,530
male rats play their prefrontal cortexes
don't develop properly.

133
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,090
Surprise,
surprise.

134
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:06,470
You're not letting them mature.
It's like,

135
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:07,850
what else would you expect?
So,

136
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,010
you know,
that's something to think about really 

137
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,010
hard.
I would say.
