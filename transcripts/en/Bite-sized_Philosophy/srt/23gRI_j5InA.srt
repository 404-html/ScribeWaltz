1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,920
So the blue fairy shows up,
so that's nature.

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:08,921
So what I'm saying is that nature will 
cut kids a break if you think of nature 

3
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:10,460
in the guise of,
well their mother for example,

4
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:15,461
but even the biology of other people,
because we're wired to accept behavior 

5
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:18,020
from children that we wouldn't accept 
from other people.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,440
So nature will forgive.
So she shows up in your heavenly guys 

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,850
and says what's going on?
And Pinocchio again,

8
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:31,340
because he's naive,
but also because he's not good.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,380
He's not evil either.
He's,

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,990
he's neither or both.
It depends on how you look at it.

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,410
And he also has no idea how smart he is 
and how smart he isn't or how smart the 

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,400
person he's talking to his.
And uh,

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,450
instead of admitting what he's done,
he lies about it.

14
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:52,451
And that's interesting because it does 
suggest that he understands at some 

15
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:56,090
level that he set himself up for this 
because you know,

16
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:58,040
he could just say,
you could have just told the truth,

17
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,370
this horrible Fox kidnap me and sold me 
to this slave holder.

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,810
Which is true.
It's a lot more true than the story he 

19
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,240
tells.
He tells a story about some monster,

20
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,280
you know,
a fictional monster.

21
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,000
He coulda told even three quarters of 
the truth and how to work,

22
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:22,001
but he doesn't.
He just obscures the story entirely and 

23
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:25,511
this is the part of the movie that 
people remember and I'd edited this out 

24
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:26,540
for years when I was talking about this 
movie.

25
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,710
I forgot what it was so significant.
His nose grows right and it grows too 

26
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:37,160
ridiculous length.
And why is that?

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,300
I think it was Mark Twain,
Samuel Clemens,

28
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:49,301
I think who said,
one of the advantages to telling the 

29
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:52,541
truth is that you don't have to remember
what you said and that God that's worth 

30
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,360
listening to because.

31
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,110
So there's a bunch of things I've 
learned as a clinician and one of them 

32
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,191
is because you're often in really weird 
situations with people if you're a 

33
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:07,580
clinician because things happen that 
don't happen normally and you don't know

34
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:12,581
what to do.
And so what I've learned is I just say 

35
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:12,581
what I just say,
what's happening,

36
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:13,910
whatever it is,
regardless of what it is,

37
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:18,911
you know,
I'll just try to describe it as 

38
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:19,100
accurately as I can and not worry about 
in some sense,

39
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:20,960
not worried about the consequences,
you know,

40
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:22,790
like I'm not going out of my way to 
cause trouble.

41
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,010
But if you're in a really,
and I'm telling you,

42
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:30,011
this can save your life at times,
especially if you're dealing with 

43
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:30,011
someone who's paranoid,
who's really paranoid,

44
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,130
you do not lie to someone who's paranoid
and violent.

45
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,890
Because as soon as you lie,
you're aligned with the forces that are 

46
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,981
persecuting them and they're going to be
war because paranoid it makes people 

47
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:42,260
hypervigilant,
like they're on amphetamines.

48
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,590
In fact,
you can make people paranoid by giving 

49
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,991
them enough and fed felonies and you can
make paranoid people more paranoid by 

50
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:53,861
giving them amphetamines.
So they're hypervigilant because they 

51
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:54,620
feel that everything is predatory and 
against them.

52
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,890
And so they're watching you like you 
would not believe way more than you're 

53
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,431
watching them.
And if you flicker ally while you're 

54
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:04,990
talking to them and they're really on 
the edge,

55
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,760
you,
you're done.

56
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,170
So it's what's one thing to really know 
if you're ever in a really bad situation

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,320
and you don't know what to do,
you tell the truth.

58
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:18,430
Minimally you don't disclose too much.
That's just another lie.

59
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,080
You tell the truth minimally and 
carefully and hopefully,

60
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,920
and you might get out of it,
you might get out of it,

61
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,680
but if you falsify it,
look the hell out.

62
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,040
So the truth is a real.
It's a real mechanism of protection in 

63
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,000
dangerous situations,
you know?

64
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,260
So if someone's trying to intimidate you
and you,

65
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,320
you think they might get violent that 
they asked you if you're afraid,

66
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:48,770
then you tell them that you're terrified
and that you hope that things will go 

67
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,130
okay.
Or you say,

68
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,260
I'll give you an example.
One time I was in an airport and uh,

69
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,060
we're in this lineup to fly back to 
Canada that said international flights.

70
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:06,540
And so as long line up like 50 people 
and we got it,

71
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,960
I got about three from the front.
It was still like 40 people behind me 

72
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,961
and the guy behind the counter decided 
that he was just going to shut down the 

73
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:15,390
line and that we could all go to this 
other line,

74
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:20,391
which was like 300 people long and I 
suggested that he not do that because 

75
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:25,341
we'd been standing there for half an 
hour and that he could just deal with 

76
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:27,240
the 20 of us that were last and and like
have a clue.

77
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,290
So he called the sheriff right away and 
this was down in Florida and it wasn't 

78
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,981
that long after nine slash 11.
And so these guys came up and they were 

79
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:40,221
armed and they came and said,
looked at me because of course he told 

80
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:42,210
them that I was causing trouble,
which I wasn't.

81
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:43,530
I was just trying to not

82
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,860
left.

83
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,240
What would you say?
An arrogant bureaucratic scum rat take 

84
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,021
advantage of me.
So which is not the same as causing 

85
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:56,021
trouble.
So anyways,

86
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:57,080
as soon as the cops came up,
I said,

87
00:04:57,081 --> 00:05:00,530
look,
I'm going to do exactly what you tell me

88
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:03,530
to do right now and I'm not going to 
cause any trouble,

89
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,020
but I would like you to hear what 
actually happened.

90
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,440
And so that,
that's a good example of a situation 

91
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,440
like that.
It's like if someone's got,

92
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,000
you know,
Bravo Bravado,

93
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,410
it's a very bad idea and I was going to 
do exactly what they told me because you

94
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:18,680
know,

95
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,320
they didn't know who I was and I didn't 
know what they had been told.

96
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,410
So anyhow,
the problem with lying is that it's a 

97
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,980
hydro and kids find this out very early 
[inaudible].

98
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:36,981
You tell one lie and what happens is it 
has one of the consequences that you 

99
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:37,240
expect.
Maybe you get away with it,

100
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:39,550
but it has three or four others that you
don't expect.

101
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,820
And so it's like it grows some,
some complexity and then you have to 

102
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,530
tack a lie on each of those little 
complexity outcrops.

103
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,560
And then they grow three more 
complexities and soon this little light 

104
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,221
turns into great big ball of lies.
And at some point it becomes painfully 

105
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:58,220
evident to everyone,
and by that time you're in such,

106
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,250
you see this with politicians like that 
guy who was sexting with Anthony Wiener.

107
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:04,850
Yeah.
Perfect name for him,

108
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:05,810
man.
It's so funny.

109
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,210
Uh,
I shouldn't make that comment because 

110
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,210
it's so obvious,
but it's still funny,

111
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,780
but you know,
he,

112
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,250
that's exactly what happened to him.

113
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,250
It's like,
it wasn't even so much the event 

114
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:18,250
because,
you know,

115
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:18,860
people are stupid,
they make mistakes.

116
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:22,820
And actually the public is somewhat 
forgiving if you say,

117
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,540
yeah,
Jesus,

118
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,810
I'm a real moron and you know,
like really seriously,

119
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:28,850
how could I do that?
But I did.

120
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:33,020
And like I'll try not to do it again.
But what happens with politicians is,

121
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,170
and I'm not speaking specifically of 
politicians,

122
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:41,171
is they'll make an error and it gets 
exposed and then they make three others 

123
00:06:41,171 --> 00:06:42,380
trying to cover it up with Nixon for 
example.

124
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,960
And then the whole thing just turns into
a complete scandal.

125
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,200
And maybe they could have got out of it 
at the beginning by just telling the 

126
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,540
truth.
It's like,

127
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,550
yes,
I'm an idiot.

128
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,550
You know,
I'll try not to do it again.

129
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:01,330
Well,
that isn't what happens in this case in 

130
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,611
Pinocchio grows this elaborate series of
lies and the ferry is willing to be a 

131
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:10,961
little generous to him because he's 
little and cute and he's still a puppet 

132
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:14,320
and she tells him not to do that and 
that she's going to give them a pass 

133
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:21,131
this time,
but that she isn't going to be able to 

134
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:21,131
intervene on his behalf.

135
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:21,131
Again.
