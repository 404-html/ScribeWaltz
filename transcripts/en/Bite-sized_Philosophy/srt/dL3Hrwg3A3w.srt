1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,290
You know,
this is something my wife has pointed 

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:05,290
out to.
She said,

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,601
well,
men are going to have to stand up for 

4
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:08,601
themselves,
but here's the problem.

5
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:10,350
I know how to stand up to a man who's,
who's,

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,770
uh,
unfairly trespassing against me.

7
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:18,771
And the reason I know that is because 
the parameters for my resistance are 

8
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:20,340
quite well defined,
which is we talk,

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,260
we argue,
we push,

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,600
and then it becomes physical,
right?

11
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:29,601
Like if,
if we move beyond the boundaries of 

12
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:29,730
civil discourse,
we know what the next step is,

13
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,600
okay,
that's forbidden in,

14
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:36,601
in discourse with women.
And so I don't think that men can 

15
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,260
control crazy women.
I don't think.

16
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,290
I really don't believe that.
I think that they have to throw their 

17
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:42,290
hands up in,
in,

18
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:42,690
in,
in what,

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,770
in,
in.

20
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,070
It's not even disbelief.
It's that the cultural,

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,100
there's no step forward that you can 
take under those circumstances because 

22
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,190
if the man is offensive enough and crazy
enough,

23
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,980
the reaction becomes physical right 
away.

24
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,980
Or at least the threat is there.
And when men are talking to each other 

25
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,480
in any serious manner,
that underlying thread of physicality is

26
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,510
always there.
Especially if it's a real conversation 

27
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:08,510
and it keeps the thing.
Civil Law is to some degree,

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,720
you know,
if you're talking to a man who wouldn't 

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,190
fight with you under any circumstances 
whatsoever,

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,490
then you're talking to someone to whom 
you have absolutely no respect,

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,070
but I can't see any way.
For example,

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,650
there's a,
there's a woman in in Toronto who's been

33
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,610
organizing this movement,
let's say against me and some other 

34
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,941
people who are going to do a free speech
event and she managed to organize quite 

35
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:35,430
effectively and she's quite offensive.
You might say.

36
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:37,380
She compared us to Nazis,
for example,

37
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:37,970
which,
you know,

38
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,010
publicly using the swastika,
which wasn't really something I was all 

39
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,440
that fond of,
but I,

40
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:48,441
I'm defenseless against that kind of 
female insanity because the techniques 

41
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:52,830
that I would use against a man who is 
employing those tactics are forbidden to

42
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:53,130
me.

43
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,460
So I don't know.
Like it seems to me that it isn't man 

44
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,251
that have to stand up and say enough of 
this even though that is what they 

45
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:04,941
should do.
It seems to me that it's same women who 

46
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:05,730
have to stand up against their crazy 
sisters and say,

47
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:10,731
look,
enough of that enough man hating enough 

48
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,030
pathology,
enough bringing disgrace on us as a,

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,120
as a gender,
but the problem there and then they'll 

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,991
stop.
My little tirade is that most of the 

51
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:22,320
women I know who are saying are busy 
doing saying things right.

52
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,700
They're off.
They have their career,

53
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:28,701
they have their family,
they're quite occupied and they don't 

54
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:30,951
seem to have the time or maybe even the 
interest to go after their crazy 

55
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:34,200
heartbeat sisters and so I don't see any
regulating force for that.

56
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,410
That terrible femininity and it seems to
me to be invading the culture and 

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,220
undermining the masculine power of the 
culture in a way that's,

58
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,240
I think fatal.
