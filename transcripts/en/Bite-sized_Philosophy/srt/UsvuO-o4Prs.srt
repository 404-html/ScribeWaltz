1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,930
The postmodernists,
they're the,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,020
they're the logical conclusion of the 
Nietzschean dilemma.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,150
God is dead value.
The value structure collapsed.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,680
The specter of rises of all value 
structures collapsing.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,420
That's the postmodernist dogma.
All value structures have collapsed.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,600
They're only there for the purposes of 
exclusion.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,660
They have no intrinsic value.
It's a very,

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,720
very powerful argument.
That's why it dominates the 

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,501
universities.
That and the fact that allows people to 

10
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:37,230
dispense with their moral 
responsibility,

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,290
which is something that's never 
discussed by the postmodernist,

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,650
but you have to give the devil his due.
What's the problem with postmodernism?

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,090
Well,
if all value structures have collapsed,

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,200
then there's nothing to do because in 
order to do something,

15
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:59,160
one thing has to be better than another 
because otherwise why do it?

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,940
And so people who are ensconced in the 
postmodern tradition are undermined by 

17
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,591
their own philosophy.
They can deconstruct their own 

18
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:13,461
deconstruction,
in which case they might as well just 

19
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:16,161
sit there and do nothing which would 
actually be preferable to what they're 

20
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:16,161
doing now.

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,170
So how do they extract themselves from 
that dilemma?

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,520
They do any illogically,
but they don't care because the 

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,060
postmodernists first of all,
don't believe in logic.

24
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:34,320
That's a reflection of the logos which 
they've dispensed with dialogue.

25
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:39,321
They don't believe that because that's a
reflection of the logos which they've 

26
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:40,800
dispensed with logic and dialogue are 
irrelevant.

27
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,190
Well,
that does bring up the problem of what 

28
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:46,190
to do.
Well,

29
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,311
the postmodernist finesse that by 
reverting to the Marxist doctrines from 

30
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:51,900
which postmodernism emerged and so they 
say,

31
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:52,830
well,
yeah,

32
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,230
you can't get any direction from 
postmodernism,

33
00:01:55,231 --> 00:02:00,231
but we don't.
We're not going to worry about that 

34
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:00,231
because we don't worry about such 
things.

35
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:04,220
What we'll do is just use slight of hand
to push forward the communitarian 

36
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:09,300
doctrines out of which our original 
hypothesis emerged and everyone says,

37
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:14,301
well,
we'll turn a blind eye to the paradox 

38
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:14,301
because we actually need something to 
do,

39
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,560
and plus to the degree that we're 
communitarian,

40
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,710
we can take out our nihilistic 
resentment and arrogance and in 

41
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,941
gratitude on every single person we 
deemed to have something more than we 

42
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:25,941
have.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And so if you're wondering why certain 
values can exist in the absence of any 

44
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:37,761
value,
you have to look no farther than to 

45
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:41,031
understand that people who are desperate
and chaotic will still be angry and 

46
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:45,771
destructive,
and they can manifest that perfectly 

47
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:46,190
with the moral mask that says,
well,

48
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,370
I'm not really after what you have 
because you have a little more than me.

49
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,550
I'm speaking on behalf of these people 
who have even less.

50
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,710
It's like it's absolute nonsense.
It's so funny watching Yale students 

51
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,050
complain about the privileged.
They're in the top one 10th of 100 of a 

52
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:08,350
percent of people who've lived in the 
entire history of the planet,

53
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,780
much less just the people that are on 
the planet.

54
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:14,740
Now they're dominating patriarchs in 
training,

55
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,250
right there,
baby representatives of the patriarchy,

56
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,040
and all they do is complain about that 
tiny,

57
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,070
tiny,
infinitesimal fraction of people who 

58
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,060
have slightly more than they have now.
It's appalling.

59
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,330
And their idiot professors pat them on 
the back and send them out the world to 

60
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,160
do that.
Instead of teaching them how to live,

61
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,800
they damaged their mental health.
They,

62
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,780
they,
they heard our society.

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,410
They're bringing things down and that's 
what they're aiming at.

64
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,320
The postmodernist managed to be 
nihilistic and totalitarian at the same 

65
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,020
time,
which is something that not even need to

66
00:03:56,021 --> 00:04:01,021
dreamed about despite the fact that he 
had the greatest imagination for 

67
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:03,790
pathology that perhaps ever existed.
In addition,

68
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:08,791
they combine the nihilism and 
totalitarianism with the worst aspects 

69
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:14,041
of dogmatic religion because what 
they've essentially established is a 

70
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:18,091
cult into which children who attend 
university are now indoctrinated at 

71
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:20,500
great cost.
I might add,

72
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,690
and with very little practical outcome.
