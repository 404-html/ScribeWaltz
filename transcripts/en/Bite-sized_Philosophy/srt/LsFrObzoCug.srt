1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,600
No,
if you look at plastic hero mythology,

2
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:08,601
which we're going to do in great detail,
what you see is that the typical myth of

3
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:12,480
it,
of humanity is we live in a place,

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,470
will say we have to live in a place and 
the place is doing quite nicely.

5
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:19,620
Thank you very much.
It's like the hobbits and,

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,780
and,
uh,

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,010
Frodo,
right?

8
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:24,360
The first one,
the Lord that the,

9
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,500
uh,
what was it called?

10
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:26,820
The hobbit.
The hobbit.

11
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:31,821
Okay,
so you've got a little shy or they're 

12
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:31,821
right.
It's all peaceful.

13
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:32,940
It's full of these little people who are
a little on the arrogant side.

14
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:35,640
They're kind of dopey.
They have no idea what the hell is going

15
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:37,860
on in the outside world,
but they think that's okay.

16
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:38,490
They think,
you know,

17
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:40,020
just,
you know,

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,810
peculiar people are concerned about that
sort of thing.

19
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:45,750
They got their little happy paradise 
going.

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,340
They live a long time,
they eat a lot,

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,750
you know,
they party a lot unbeknownst to them,

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,790
which is very interesting feature of the
story.

23
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,680
The only reason they have any peace at 
all,

24
00:00:55,681 --> 00:01:00,681
it's because they are descendants of old
kings continually patrolling the 

25
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:02,130
borders.
Right?

26
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,430
Those are the striders Aragorn.
He's the member of the race of old kings

27
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:08,880
who patrols the borders.
Well,

28
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:11,580
those are.
Those are ancestral figures.

29
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:13,920
It's like you can all sit here,
your little happy paradise,

30
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:18,840
but the only reason you can do it is 
because the sons of great kings have put

31
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,670
borders around your kingdom and you can 
think it's funny because in the hobbits,

32
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,880
hobbits basically despise strider.
You're like,

33
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:28,780
you're very,
very suspicious of him.

34
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,790
He's kind of dirty and dusty and they 
looks like he's been banged around all 

35
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,020
over the world.
He started like a trap.

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,480
It's like they don't know.
He's the son of a great king.

37
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,520
Good thing for them that he is,
however.

38
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:43,521
Okay,
so then you've got the little shyer and 

39
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,000
what happens even though things are 
stirring and what is it?

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,550
Well,
fundamentally it's a great dragon.

41
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,960
Well,
that's a snake,

42
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:50,760
except it's like medicine snake,
you know,

43
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:51,780
it's,
it's,

44
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,140
it's snake with fire and you can be sure
that fire was not only one of our 

45
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,530
greatest allies,
but one of our greatest enemies,

46
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:00,930
especially when we lived on the Veltin 
Africa,

47
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,880
because that thing would burn now in 
them,

48
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,330
you know,
and so get the hell away from that as 

49
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:08,430
well.
So anyways,

50
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:12,780
so one hobbit,
who's woken up by a wizard,

51
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,920
the wizard is a symbol of the cell from 
the union perspective.

52
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:21,921
So there's one hobbit who's a little bit
more creative and exploratory than the 

53
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:22,650
rest,
and everybody has a level of respect for

54
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:27,651
him,
but they think he's pretty damn 

55
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:27,651
peculiar.

56
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:27,870
He decides that he's gonna under the 
tutelage of the wizard.

57
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:32,190
He's going to go check out this dragon.
So he leaves the borders and he goes out

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,790
into the unknown.
And then the rest of it is an adventure.

59
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,800
And one of the things that's very 
interesting again,

60
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:42,801
from a union perspective is that what is
the hobbit have to become in order to 

61
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:46,500
conquer the Dragon?
A thief?

62
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,900
Now that's pretty weird,
a because you think,

63
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,520
hey man,
this guy's out to be a hero,

64
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:51,840
so he should be a hero.
It's like,

65
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:54,270
no,
he turns into a thief.

66
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,160
Why?
Well,

67
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:58,080
it's because if you're going to conquer 
a dragon,

68
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,200
you be a hell of a lot tougher than you 
are naive,

69
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,980
and so partly what happens is that for 
the hobbit to muster up the forces that 

70
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,050
are necessary for him to confront 
something that that is that fundamental,

71
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,470
he asked to transcend his towered.

72
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,820
What would you call it?
The the cowardice that he describes as 

73
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,310
morality.
Okay,

74
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:22,720
so need shift,
for example,

75
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,440
niche is often viewed as a critic critic
of morality.

76
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,070
It's like that's not true.
What?

77
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,080
Because nature identifies morality with 
cowardice,

78
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,200
but that's not what he does.
What Nisha says is this,

79
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,260
if you're too afraid to do something so 
you won't do it,

80
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,400
then you'll say that the reason that you
don't do it is because your moral.

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,480
That's not the reason.
The reason is it's you're too damn 

82
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:51,480
afraid to do it.
You might want to,

83
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,710
but you're too afraid.
That doesn't make you moral.

84
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,350
So what happens to the Harvard,
for example,

85
00:03:56,351 --> 00:04:01,351
is once he gets outside the kingdom,
he asked to develop a whole array of 

86
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,720
potentials that he never developed 
before because they were either not 

87
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,591
necessary in his civilized place or 
because they were forbidden as immoral 

88
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,480
by the cultural situation that he grew 
up there.
