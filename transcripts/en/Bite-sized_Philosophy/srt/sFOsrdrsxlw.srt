1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,260
So this week we've had the google thing,
there was the youtube thing that 

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,140
happened last week,
what's going on with censorship and what

3
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:12,070
should people do about it?

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,460
If you're in a workplace in 
pathological,

5
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:17,350
things are happening.
This is easy.

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:22,351
I can tell you how you know of 
pathological things are happening at 

7
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:23,920
your workplace or they're happening with
you one of the two.

8
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:28,921
But you can straighten that out if 
you're being required to do things that 

9
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:32,890
make you weak and ashamed,

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,060
then stop.
Don't do them.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,280
Like one of the things I learned from 
Solzhenitsyn and Frankl was that

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,110
systems go terribly under,
out of control when people don't stop 

13
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,461
them,
when they're going mildly out of 

14
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:55,461
control.
You know,

15
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:58,941
when you might say,
I should just keep my goddamn head down 

16
00:00:58,941 --> 00:00:59,040
and shut up.
It's like maybe you should like,

17
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,440
that's not bad advice.
You know,

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,680
you don't want to make unnecessary 
enemies and you don't need any more 

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,621
trouble than you need,
but you got to ask yourself on a day to 

20
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:10,950
day basis what makes you think you're 
not selling your soul?

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,480
You know?
And there's so much foolishness going on

22
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:19,680
in the mid level bureaucratic world now 
that's where all the tyranny seems to be

23
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:24,681
focused.
And the reason that it multiplies is 

24
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:25,980
because sensible people say nothing

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,790
when they should say something.
And what's so strange about that is that

26
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,750
there are way more sensible people than 
people who aren't sensible.

27
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:38,700
They're just not as noisy.
So what you'll turn out if like,

28
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,920
so let's say something's bugging the 
hell out of you at work,

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,650
well then you have to prepare it to find
another job.

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,680
That's the first thing you have to do.
I don't think that you should find 

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,431
another job,
but you should prepare to find another 

32
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:53,431
job.
And if possible,

33
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:58,201
you should prepare to find a better job.
Because if you can't tell someone to go 

34
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,170
to hell,
then you can't negotiate with them.

35
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,810
And if and if they've got you over a 
barrel,

36
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:03,970
then you can't say anything.
So you gotTa,

37
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,790
you gotta set yourself up.
So you've got some mobility and actually

38
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,410
that's a really good principal in your 
life,

39
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:08,890
period.

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,700
You should set yourself up so that you 
have a lateral move at hand.

41
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,220
And then you should find out,
well,

42
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:18,370
are there things at work that are 
disturbing my soul?

43
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,230
You know,
and you find that out.

44
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,460
First of all,
you ask yourself,

45
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:22,510
okay,
I'm disturbed at work.

46
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:27,511
Okay,
I'm probably week and deceitful and 

47
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:27,820
useless and lazy.
He might as well start with that.

48
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,030
And then you talk to some people like 
your wife,

49
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,560
your friends,
your coworkers,

50
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:35,680
and find out are you stupid,
deceitful and lazy,

51
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,200
or is there something not so good going 
on at work?

52
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:43,201
And so if you,
if you can then eliminate your own 

53
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:43,960
personal pathology as a cause of your 
dissatisfaction,

54
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,320
then maybe there's something rotten in 
the state of Denmark and maybe you 

55
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,760
should say something about it before the
whole goddamn thing collapses.

56
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:56,761
Because that can happen.
It can happen in companies a lot faster 

57
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:56,761
than people ever think.

58
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,210
You know?
And you may find that,

59
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,300
well,
first of all may find if you say 

60
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,300
something,
well first of all,

61
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,300
that's an adventure.
That's for sure.

62
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,750
That's a bloody adventure.
And you have to do it carefully and,

63
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,710
and you have to be prepared for it.
But it might be the best thing that ever

64
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:11,620
happened to you.
And the other thing is if you're careful

65
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,210
about it,
you get your words right.

66
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,180
Like in this is a,
this is strategic battle,

67
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:21,181
right?
It's not something you wander into 

68
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:22,531
carelessly.
Then you may find that there's lots of 

69
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:25,291
people who feel exactly the same way you
do and that you've actually caught and 

70
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,611
onto something.
You're a canary in a coal mine and not 

71
00:03:28,611 --> 00:03:31,321
just some like psychopathic mouthpiece.
So you got to ask yourself,

72
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:34,570
when you go and do what you do like,
is this making you stronger?

73
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,360
Is this making you weaker?
And if it's making you weaker,

74
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,660
then you got to ask yourself,
do you really want to be weaker?

75
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,030
Because the weaker you get,
the more your tyrannized.

76
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:45,430
And then worse than that,
like the weaker you get,

77
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:50,431
the more bitter you get.
And the more you'll work towards 

78
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:50,530
terrible things,
the more you'll snap it your wife,

79
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,180
the more you'll kick your kids.
You know,

80
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,270
like it's no joke to be tyrannized at 
work.

81
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,840
And so I would say you have an ethical 
responsibility as a citizen to 

82
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,510
forthrightly confront,
creeping tyranny,

83
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,690
no matter where it occurs.
And part of,

84
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,320
part of what we're learning,
I would say from these stories,

85
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:15,850
if we're learning anything at all,
is that if you're aimed at the good,

86
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,580
which is a question you really got to 
ask yourself,

87
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:21,070
you know,
if you're genuinely aimed at the good,

88
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,940
then take heart because you're a lot 
stronger than you think.

89
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,650
So

90
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,890
I have a followup question.
Okay.

91
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,250
So I'm speaking to,
there's lots of people who were in this 

92
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:35,250
situation like,
you know,

93
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,420
people at universities and corporations 
all over the place.

94
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:38,170
I,
you know,

95
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Google is not the only company that is 
not the worst repressive,

96
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,210
uh,
freedom of speech,

97
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,810
denying workplace codes and everybody 
feels alone,

98
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,730
right?
They're all like,

99
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,610
why should I stand up,
be a martyr,

100
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,830
get fired.
This guy at Google got fired.

101
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,840
Yeah.
What's the point?

102
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,740
And like,
I'm asking rhetorically.

103
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,900
No,
it's a good question.

104
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,960
And how do you,
how do you convince people that there's 

105
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,680
a point to,
to standing up when it appears to be 

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:13,680
futile?

107
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,060
Okay.

108
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Well,
the first thing I think is you convince 

109
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:19,800
them that it's not few tiles.
It might be difficult,

110
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,780
but it's not futile.
If you get your words right,

111
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,440
you have something to say.
There'll be an impact of those words.

112
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,840
It might not be the impact that you 
would choose,

113
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,050
but the.
But the other thing you got to tell 

114
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,870
people is pick your poison.
You don't.

115
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,000
You may be in a situation where you 
don't have a.

116
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,410
You don't have a cake.
Walk to the garden of Paradise.

117
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,710
You got tyranny or famine.
Those are your choices,

118
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,210
but you get to pick which one you have.
And I would say if,

119
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,660
if you're being oppressed and I mean in 
your soul by what you're required to 

120
00:05:56,281 --> 00:06:00,020
swallow at work,
well you think you're not paying a price

121
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:03,350
for that.
You got no self respect and,

122
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:03,870
and,
and,

123
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,360
and rightly so,
but worse than that,

124
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,840
you're an agent of your own destruction.
You're destroying your own ideal and 

125
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,870
you're letting people who are weak and 
corrupt when

126
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,090
and if you stood up and stood up 
properly,

127
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:22,040
but you have to put yourself in order to
do this.

128
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,210
At least to some degree,
right?

129
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:28,211
You can't do it casually.
You have to do it from some position of 

130
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:32,380
preparedness and strength.
Then what makes you think you couldn't 

131
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,000
scare them back into the corners and 
that would be a good thing and you know 

132
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,760
the alternative personally is bad 
because there's a psychological 

133
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,150
degeneration that goes along with it.
I've seen this with many,

134
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:49,151
many of the people that I've worked with
who have been tyrannized in the 

135
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:51,950
workplace to the absolute detriment of 
their psychological and physical health.

136
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Right?
To the point of collapse confronting 

137
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,730
these crazy,
crazy things when they were sensible 

138
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,880
people.
That's a terrible price to pay man.

139
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,100
Like it's,
it's a bad price.

140
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:09,190
And then if the foolishness isn't dealt 
with at the local level when it's still 

141
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:16,301
relatively trivial,
then it will multiply until it's dealt 

142
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:19,661
with at the social level and we're 
seeing signs of that already on two fa 

143
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:20,650
is a good sign of that,
you know,

144
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:25,651
and problems that aren't solved.
Multiply and soon people fight and you 

145
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:27,080
know,
edit,

146
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,070
argue,
then to fight.

147
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,040
Unless you want to fight and some people
want to fight and I can understand why,

148
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,540
but I wouldn't recommend it because

149
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,960
that doesn't lead good places.
It really doesn't lead good places,

150
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,770
so I would say you have a duty.
Maybe that's,

151
00:07:46,771 --> 00:07:49,460
that's where you stand up.
It's because you have a god damn duty to

152
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:54,461
stand up and say,
just say what you have to say it.

153
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,810
You don't even have to be trying to make
a point.

154
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,370
Exactly.
You're trying to get something done.

155
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:00,980
It's like,
this is how it looks to me.

156
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,840
That's what that guy had.
Google did.

157
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,630
He wrote this memo and he said he.
I talked to him today.

158
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,170
He said,
well,

159
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,320
he went to a diversity training seminar 
and he thought,

160
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,290
no,
I don't agree with that.

161
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,700
And so then they asked for feedback.
So we wrote this document a month ago.

162
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:19,940
This was written a month ago.
Got No real response to it.

163
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,270
Well,
it bounced around inside Google until a 

164
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,660
lot of people got interested in that.
It escaped into the outside world,

165
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:32,410
but all he was doing was.
He was told a bunch of things he didn't 

166
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,821
think were true.
He wrote down a bunch of things he 

167
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:37,250
thought were probably true.
He launched that out and said,

168
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,710
well,
I think these things are probably true.

169
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,550
It's like,
well,

170
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,680
probably their true well,
so he paid a price for it,

171
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:47,720
but maybe we'll see what sort of price 
he paid for it,

172
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:52,721
man.
It's going to be a lot tougher in two 

173
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:52,721
years than he was two years ago.
So.

174
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,720
No,
no,

175
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,830
they didn't answer his feedback.
No,

176
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,420
no,
but,

177
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,820
well,
you can watch the video,

178
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,220
the stories there,
but that's kind of the outline of it.

179
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,600
So,
sorry to monopolize this.

180
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,000
I have one other question about this and
I think it's important,

181
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,990
aside from Google just being a 
workplace,

182
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,480
right?
It also controls the on Youtube,

183
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,390
right?
Which,

184
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,970
which is post a new censorship scheme,
um,

185
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,910
and it controls a huge amount of the 
information that people get.

186
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:33,130
And so true.
And so what happens to society when 

187
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:39,150
companies such as Google,
which control our information start to 

188
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,500
censor,
not just how about ourselves and maybe 

189
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,200
the information that's coming out to the
rest of the world.

190
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,250
How much is this already happening and 
how much?

191
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,440
How about if we would have,
if we refuse to find out,

192
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,850
that would be good.
You know,

193
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:56,000
like I reviewed this,
this guy's document,

194
00:09:56,001 --> 00:10:01,001
I did that yesterday and everything he 
said was validated by the scientific 

195
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:04,760
literature.
So what has happened is that someone has

196
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:09,761
been fired publicly by a major 
corporation for stating well grounded 

197
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:14,710
scientific truths right there.
Exactly the sorts of things that I say 

198
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,271
in my classes for example.
And the reason that I say to them is 

199
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:21,731
because I read the literature.
It's not because I'm personally happy 

200
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:25,121
about the fact.
I think Iq research particularly is so 

201
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:28,220
dismal that you can't possibly read it 
without being seriously disheartened.

202
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,190
If I could reconstruct the world.
So that ICU,

203
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,730
the ICU research wasn't true.
Well,

204
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,980
it should be tempting,
you know,

205
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,470
but that's not how science works.
Science doesn't tell you what you,

206
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,450
what you want to hear,
it just tells you the way it bloody well

207
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:47,900
is,
and he got pilloried for.

208
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,990
He got pilloried for revealing a good 
fraction of current scientific knowledge

209
00:10:55,431 --> 00:10:57,290
about gender differences.
Okay.

210
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,100
That's not good.
And as you said,

211
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,470
that's a big company and it controls our
communication.

212
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,680
It's how about we do what we can to 
ensure that these large communication 

213
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:15,671
companies don't get to impose a 
factually false ideological structure on

214
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:23,630
the rest of the planet where you can 
think about supporting this.

215
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,290
This guy who blew the whistle,
there's a fundraiser for him online.

216
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,040
He could use some money.
He wants to sue google.

217
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,920
Yeah,
thank you.

218
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,750
Maybe we could.
Maybe we could let

219
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,750
them know that hiring a human resources 
director who's also concerned with 

220
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:48,630
equity is probably not a good idea for 
capitalist company.

221
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,810
Why in the world would you hire your own
enemies?

222
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,420
I don't understand that so.
Well,

223
00:11:55,421 --> 00:12:00,421
we'll see how the dialogue continues,
but back to the personal like you need 

224
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:05,680
to say what you think because that's 
where you come from.

225
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,440
Right?
And if you don't say what you think,

226
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:11,680
then you kill your unborn self.
That's what you do.

227
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:14,080
That's what Cain did when he killed 
Abel.

228
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,330
And that's why his punishment was 
unbearable.

229
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,540
You know you have things in you that are
struggling to come to the light.

230
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,670
That's the truth.
You need daughter and you need to either

231
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:25,720
that truth because without that truth,
who cannot live in the world because the

232
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:28,330
world is real and you need truth to live
in the world.

233
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,400
And if you stifle your truth,
well,

234
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,850
how,
how can that be anything but something 

235
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,040
that brings about hell,
how could it be any other way?

236
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,570
So you think,
well,

237
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:42,571
why should you speak up?
That's easy because the consequences of 

238
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:44,440
not speaking up,
although delayed are far worse.

239
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,420
That's the reason.
That's the reason.

240
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,760
If,
if,

241
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,080
if it can't be courage,
it could at least be prudent.

242
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,090
So.
Yep.
