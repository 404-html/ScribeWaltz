1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,090
Iliads idea was this,
that things fall apart of their own 

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,571
accord merely because they age that 
that's the first motif in the flood 

3
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:09,730
story and that's only to say that if you
build something,

4
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:13,410
it indicates if you build something and 
you just leave it the hell alone,

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,450
it will soon not work.
Right?

6
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:20,451
And that's entropy.
So one of the reasons that the flood 

7
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:21,090
always threatens is merely because of 
entropy.

8
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:26,091
And you see that reflected in the 
Egyptian story because one of the 

9
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:26,091
reasons that,
oh,

10
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:30,540
cyrus falls prey to seth is because 
these old,

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,120
you know,
he was a great hero when he was young 

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,330
and created the Egyptian state,
like the men of renown.

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,780
But now he's old and it's worse.
He's willfully blind,

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,840
but that's the next thing.
But the fact that he's old is just to 

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,570
start things fall apart of their own 
accord.

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,570
So once something is given to you,
you have to maintain it just to ensure 

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,740
its continued existence.
And so you actually,

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,890
you actually have a contract with most 
of the things that you own.

19
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,710
It's like a,
it's like a moral contract.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,920
Let's say you have a car or you've 
decided that you're going to sacrifice 

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,230
to have the car and so you've,
you've performed an ethical calculation,

22
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,890
but the car was only worth the sacrifice
as long as it functions as a car and so 

23
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:16,050
what that means is that to justify the 
sacrifice you've made,

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,140
to have the car,
you have to maintain the car because 

25
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,081
otherwise you're acting out the 
proposition that the thing you 

26
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:25,980
sacrificed for actually didn't have any 
value and so your obliterating that as a

27
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:30,981
useful contract and you run into the 
situation where the car will just 

28
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:33,960
deteriorate of its own accord and then 
you won't have a car at all.

29
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,220
Well,
so let's say,

30
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,480
how do you speed the process by which 
your car deteriorates?

31
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,680
Well,
that's easy.

32
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,160
You're driving it along the road and it 
starts to make a ticking noise.

33
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:44,580
Tick,
tick,

34
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:44,940
tick,
tick,

35
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:49,941
tick,
and you think I should go have that 

36
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:49,941
ticking noise checked because you've 
heard it and then you think,

37
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,090
Nah,
it won't matter.

38
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,290
It's like,
yeah,

39
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,830
probably it will matter.
And what is matter mean well matter his 

40
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,620
mother.
That's chaos to you no matter.

41
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,970
But what it means is that that little 
ticking noise is the birthplace of tire 

42
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,081
matt in your car.
That's a good way of thinking about it 

43
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:09,960
is that it's your first indication that 
the dragon of chaos is going to manifest

44
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:12,090
itself in your car.
That happens when you.

45
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,250
I've got a funny story about that.
So I had a friend in graduate school,

46
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,671
someone I really liked,
but I wouldn't call her mcelliott 

47
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:22,920
mechanically inclined,
let's put it that way.

48
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,000
And she had an old Honda and those 
things were notorious for rusting out.

49
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,370
This is 30 years ago when they were 
first produced.

50
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:34,371
They weren't adapted well to Canadian 
winters and we used to go into her car 

51
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:38,421
and her Honda and it got a little on the
scary side because it was so rusty 

52
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:40,190
underneath that you can actually see 
through the floorboards.

53
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,290
And that actually made me nervous 
because if you can see through the 

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,220
floorboards,
that means that they're not really 

55
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,240
floorboards.
What they are is like rust.

56
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,600
And so I mentioned the fact that that 
might be a problem to her a couple of 

57
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,251
times,
but she was sort of blind about it and 

58
00:02:58,251 --> 00:02:58,500
one day she was driving down St Lawrence
Street in Montreal,

59
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:03,130
which is the main running roughly north 
and south and her hood popped up it band

60
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:08,131
and popped up spontaneously.
And so she was really curious about 

61
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:08,131
that.

62
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:11,620
And so she was with this friend of hers 
and was just as clueless mechanically as

63
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:16,621
she was,
which is really quite remarkably 

64
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:18,871
clueless.
And so they pulled off into a service 

65
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:19,030
station and had the guy come out and 
look at it.

66
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:19,940
And well,
he,

67
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,230
he opened the hood obviously.
And what had happened was the body had 

68
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,410
fallen off the frame.
So.

69
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,500
And what had happened was the shock,
which is supposed to be attached to the 

70
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:31,870
car,
had pushed up through the,

71
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,420
through the,
the hood.

72
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,250
So literally the car body had fallen 
onto the ground and.

73
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,600
But she was,
she managed to drive the cart.

74
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,520
Okay.
So look,

75
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,760
that's,
I wouldn't exactly call that willful 

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,670
blindness because perhaps there is an 
element of willful blindness.

77
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:50,080
She didn't know anything about 
mechanics,

78
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,610
but you get the point,
right.

79
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:56,611
It's like,
let's say she would been in a fatal 

80
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:56,611
accident.
You might say,

81
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,931
well,
you can shake your fist at God for 

82
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:00,931
producing the circumstances,
but you know the fact that you could see

83
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:04,110
through the floorboards,
that's probably something that you might

84
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,280
have paid attention to,
and so it's always.

85
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:09,100
The question is this,
if things fall apart around you,

86
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,400
to what degree is it the mere tendency 
of things to degenerate entropically 

87
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,870
because they do that of their own accord
or have you sped the probability of 

88
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:23,911
decay by failing to pay attention?
When a little snake manifests itself 

89
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:24,670
inside your paradise.
