1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,420
There's this idea in Christianity that 
we've discussed briefly that the judge 

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,910
and the redeemer are the same figure.
Now you know in the book of revelation,

3
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:13,911
you may know this and you may not.
Christ comes back as a judge and he has 

4
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:18,600
a sword coming into a revelatory vision 
that that book,

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:22,260
it's a very strange.
It's the last thing you'd expect.

6
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:24,030
Conservative Christians is to believe 
in.

7
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:27,210
Believe me,
it's such a visionary hallucination,

8
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:32,211
the book of revelation,
but Christ comes back with a sword 

9
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:35,391
coming out of his mouth and he comes 
back as a judge and he divides the 

10
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:38,310
damned from the redeemed and most are 
damned in some are redeemed is a very,

11
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:43,311
very harsh.
Now young believed that the figure of 

12
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:45,270
Christ in the Gospels was too agreeable 
to merciful,

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,300
to tilted towards mercy and that that 
called out for a counter position and 

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,020
that was the counter position of 
judgment.

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,660
Very interesting hypothesis,
but then,

16
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:58,850
but then there's this melding of the two
ideas that the judge and the redeemer or

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,140
the same thing,
okay?

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,070
Now,
this young man told me that his life 

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,941
lacked purpose and direction and meaning
and that he was nihilistic until he 

20
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:16,401
started.
He read Zen and the art of motorcycle 

21
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:16,950
maintenance,
which is a book I actually liked quite a

22
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:21,951
bit.
I've read it three times at different 

23
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:23,511
decades of my life,
and one of the things that's very 

24
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:24,300
interesting about that book is that it's
an examination of the idea of quality,

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,960
of the idea that there are qualitative 
distinctions between things and that we 

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,310
have an instinct to make qualitative 
distinctions,

27
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:37,110
and so equality is tate of distinction 
is simply this is better than that,

28
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,510
which is a judgment.
Okay?

29
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:44,511
Now what ratzinger is hypothesizing is 
that the person in and up.

30
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,500
You know how the idea of the modern idea
is you're supposed to accept yourself.

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,690
I think that's an insane idea,
by the way.

32
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,050
Really I think.
I can't think of a more nihilistic idea 

33
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,630
then that you're already okay.
It's like,

34
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:58,410
no,
you're not,

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,600
and the reason you're not is could you 
can be way more than you are,

36
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:04,440
and so what do you want to be?
You want to be okay as you are or do you

37
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:08,970
want to strive towards what's better,
and this young man,

38
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,760
this Australia,
and he said that the reason that Zen and

39
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:16,761
the art of motorcycle maintenance had 
such an impact on him was because he 

40
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,360
wasn't happy with his current mode of 
being right.

41
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:23,361
He didn't consider the manner in which 
he conducted himself sufficient and the 

42
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:29,121
fact that the author of Zen,
it was laid out.

43
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:34,191
The notion that you could make 
qualitative distinctions and there 

44
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:37,131
really was a difference between good 
things and bad things are great things 

45
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:37,131
and evil things.

46
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:39,150
It gives you direction.
It gives you,

47
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,430
gives you the possibility of moving 
upward and and ratzinger is pointing out

48
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,580
at least to some degree that human 
beings are insufficient in and of 

49
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,331
themselves and need the movement upward.
And so they need to conceptualize 

50
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:55,350
something like the highest good and then
to strive for that.

51
00:02:55,351 --> 00:03:00,351
And the thing is is that there isn't any
difference between conceptualizing the 

52
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:05,200
good and being judged.
Because if you're going to conceptualize

53
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,620
the good and move towards what you have 
to do is separate from yourself.

54
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:13,621
All those things that aren't good and 
leave them behind and that's why the 

55
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:15,250
redeemer and the judge or the same 
thing,

56
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,980
and one of the things that's really 
appalling,

57
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:22,981
I think about our modern world is that 
we're rejecting the notion of 

58
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:23,920
qualitative distinctions.
He said,

59
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,930
well,
we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings

60
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,060
by saying that one thing is better than 
the other.

61
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,080
It's like,
okay,

62
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:34,081
fair enough.
It's not fun to be cast off with the 

63
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:34,960
damned.
That's for sure,

64
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,170
but if people are in fact insufficient 
internet in their present condition,

65
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,960
which seems to be the case.
I mean try finding someone who isn't.

66
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Then if you deny the possibility of 
qualitative distinction because you want

67
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:54,871
to promote a radical egalitarianism,
then you remove the possibility of 

68
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:56,950
redemption because there's no movement 
towards the good.

69
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,750
And it seems to me that it's a 
catastrophe to sacrifice the good for.

70
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,140
Well,
it's a catastrophe to sacrifice the good

71
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:07,910
for the equal because for us to be 
equal,

72
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:12,911
it would be mean as far as I can tell 
that we would all be equally unredeemed 

73
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:14,680
and miserable.
And so.
