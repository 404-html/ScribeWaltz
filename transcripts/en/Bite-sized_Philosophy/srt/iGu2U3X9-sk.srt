1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,560
I don't want my young children 
indoctrinated with dangerous ideas.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,140
Um,
and as time marches on,

3
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:11,141
I trust public education less and less.
I know that you have strong thoughts on 

4
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:14,060
the danger of the devouring oedipal 
mother who harms her child by protecting

5
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:19,061
them.
And that's certainly not what I aspire 

6
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:22,661
to.
I wonder if in spite of your idea that 

7
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:24,170
kids need to become tough and learn to 
slay dragons,

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,560
if you have anything good to say about 
the idea of homeschooling.

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,490
Well,
I don't have anything bad to say about 

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,891
it.
I do know that the government has 

11
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:39,010
recently taken moves to make it much 
more difficult for people to homeschool 

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,610
their children.
And it's not like five years.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,640
I mean,
15 years ago I would have presumed that 

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,321
the vast majority of people who were 
homeschooled schooling their children 

15
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:52,670
were to be viewed with skepticism.
Initially.

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:58,150
I'm not so sure about that anymore.
You know,

17
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:02,000
for example,
I was sent a poster today.

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,780
Someone sent me this link that they 
found in the local junior high school 

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,860
and one of the media pieces that were 
recommended on this poster was a movie 

20
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:18,431
called Hedwig.
And the angry inch now I thought that 

21
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:22,601
was a terrible movie even though I'm 
perfectly capable of enjoying bizarre 

22
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:22,880
movies,
but.

23
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:24,800
So it's a bizarre movie,
that's for sure.

24
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:28,190
But I also thought it was a terrible 
bitter movie.

25
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,560
Terrible and bitter.
Those are separate.

26
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,570
A movie can be bitter and be quite 
great,

27
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,820
but it was a terrible movie and it was a
bitter movie.

28
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,130
But I can tell you one bloody thing 
about that movie.

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,250
It's not required viewing for 12 year 
old kids,

30
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,080
that's for sure.
So I think you have increasing reason to

31
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:47,180
be skeptical of the public education 
system.

32
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:52,181
I also looked at the Elementary Teachers
Federation of Ontario's guidelines for 

33
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:55,490
education from kindergarten to grade 
eight.

34
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,730
And what that is in essence,
and I think I will do a video about it 

35
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,890
in the relatively near future,
is a blueprint for transforming children

36
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:08,891
into social justice warriors.
Have basically says that it's like you 

37
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:10,130
don't have to be a conspiracy theory to 
read that.

38
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:15,131
I mean,
we have social justice tribunals in 

39
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:15,260
Ontario and so the idea is,
well,

40
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:18,350
if you're going to get your children,
if you're going to get people to,

41
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,760
what would you say favor equity 
properly?

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,790
Well then you better start teaching them
while they're young.

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,080
It's like maybe not.
So now you,

44
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,060
you asked that question properly because
he's say,

45
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:37,550
well,
the terrible education system,

46
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,950
the wonderful mother homeschooling,
right?

47
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,090
That's the danger.
It's like,

48
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:46,091
no,
because it might not be the wonderful 

49
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:49,241
mother homeschooling.
It might be the pathological mother 

50
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:52,031
using the pathology of the education 
system as an excuse to get her talons 

51
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:53,120
into her children.
Right?

52
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:58,121
Because that's certainly equally 
possible or perhaps even more possible 

53
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:58,820
because at least in the public 
education,

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,200
there's some necessity for consensus.
So that's something that you have to be 

55
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:09,460
very aware of and work to prevent.
Right.

56
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:11,290
And so I would say if you're going to do
that,

57
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,760
probably best not to do it on your own 
and you need.

58
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,220
It's like you need a board of advisors 
or something like that.

59
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:20,620
And so maybe it can't just be you and 
you have to figure out,

60
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:25,621
well what,
what is the name and how are you going 

61
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:28,971
to manage that and what makes you think 
you can do it even if it's being done 

62
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:28,971
badly publicly.

63
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:30,730
What makes you think you could do it 
better?

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,590
I mean,
my general advice is,

65
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:34,120
and people have asked me this,
in fact,

66
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:39,121
I had a conversation with the guy who 
was tiling my backyard this morning 

67
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:42,730
about something his son had said to him 
that he was taught at school recently,

68
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,560
which really made the tyler who had come
from a rather authoritarian country,

69
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,980
step back on his heels and think,
I'm not so sure I should be sending my 

70
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,210
kid to public school anymore and maybe I
shouldn't be living in Toronto even,

71
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,720
you know.
But my general advice is keep an eye on 

72
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,400
your kids and discuss with them what 
they're learning and,

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,720
and help equip them with the tools to

74
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,870
not only to articulate their own 
viewpoint in response to what they're 

75
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,821
being taught now at.
The problem is you might not have the 

76
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:19,821
time,
nor the ability to do that.

77
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:24,021
That's no simple thing and increasingly 
if you're unwilling to have your 

78
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:29,241
children participate in what is 
increasingly indoctrination and not 

79
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:34,161
education,
thanks to in no small part to the 

80
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:34,530
Ontario Institute of Studies on 
Education,

81
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:39,531
which is an institution that I 
particularly despise because I think 

82
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:44,091
that all it does is almost all it does 
now is produce indoctrinates of 

83
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:46,500
children.
It's not an easy,

84
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,200
it's not an easily easy problem to 
solve,

85
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,340
so more more power to you wanting to put
your children in a situation where 

86
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:03,300
they're not being indoctrinated,
but the alternative is very,

87
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:06,540
very complicated and difficult.
So

88
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,420
yeah,
thanks.
