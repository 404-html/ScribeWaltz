1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,450
There's this idea in union psychology 
called the circumambulation and young 

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,861
had this idea that you had a potential 
future self which would be in potential 

3
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:15,741
everything that you could be and that it
manifests itself moment to moment in 

4
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:20,520
your present life by making you 
interested in things and the things that

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:25,521
you're interested in are the things that
would guide you along the path that 

6
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:28,941
would lead you to maximal development.
Now it sounds like a metaphysical idea 

7
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:32,040
or a or a mystical idea even,
but,

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,380
but it's not.
It's not.

9
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:36,510
It's a really profoundly biological 
idea.

10
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:38,100
The idea is something like,
well,

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,880
your setup so that you're automatically 
interested in those things that was 

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,810
fully expand you as a well adapted 
creature.

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,950
Well,
like there's nothing radical about that 

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,950
idea.
How else,

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,770
what else could possibly be the case 
unless there's something fundamentally 

16
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,510
flawed about you that is what the 
situation would be.

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,750
It's kind of interesting to think about 
how that would be manifest moment to 

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:02,760
moment,
but the idea is something like,

19
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,150
well,
your interest is captured by those 

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,150
things that lead you down the path of 
development.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,350
Will that better be the case?
Okay,

22
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:15,351
so that's fine,
and so there's some utility in pursuing 

23
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:16,350
those things that you're interested in 
and that's the call to adventure,

24
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:21,351
let's say.
So in the call to adventure takes you 

25
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:24,861
all sorts of places.
Now the problem with the call to 

26
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:24,861
adventure is like,
what the hell do you know?

27
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:29,690
You might be interested in things that 
are kind of warped and bent and often 

28
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,191
it's the case that when new parts of 
people manifest themselves and grip 

29
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:39,171
their interest,
say they do it very badly and shoddily 

30
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:41,610
and so you stumble around like an idiot.
When you try to do something new,

31
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,460
that's where the fool is the precursor 
to the savior from the,

32
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,650
from the symbolic perspectives.

33
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,650
Because you have to be a fool before you
can be a master and if you're not 

34
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:51,650
willing to be a fool and you can't be a 
master,

35
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,541
so so you're going to.
It's an error error ridden process and 

36
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:02,691
that's also laid out the old testament 
stories because the first thing that 

37
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:02,691
happens to all these patriarchal 
figures,

38
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:06,690
when God kicks them out of their 
father's house when they're like 84,

39
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,930
is that they.
They run into all sorts of trouble and 

40
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,230
some of it's social and some of it's 
natural,

41
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,940
some of it's a consequence of their own 
moral inadequacy,

42
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,580
so they're fools and.
But,

43
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,610
but the thing that's so interesting is 
that despite the fact that they're 

44
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,001
fools,
they're still supposed to go on the 

45
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:27,591
adventure and that they're capable of 
learning enough as a consequence of 

46
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:32,271
moving forward on the adventure so that 
they straightened themselves out across 

47
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:32,271
time.

48
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:35,430
And so it's something like this and this
circumambulation that young talked about

49
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:38,490
was this continual,
we'll return to this.

50
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,300
This continual circling in some sense of
who you could be.

51
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,770
You might notice,
for example,

52
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:45,480
that there are themes in your life.
You know,

53
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,000
when you go back across your 
experiences,

54
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,920
you see,
you kind of have your typical experience

55
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:53,790
that sort of repeats itself and there 
might be variation on it,

56
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,270
like a musical theme,
but it's,

57
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,390
it's like you're circling yourself and 
getting closer to yourself as you move 

58
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,740
across time.
That's the circumambulation.

59
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,050
Now you remember that for a sec because 
we'll go back to it.

60
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,410
Okay,
so imagine that something glimmers 

61
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,631
before you.
It's an an interest that's dawning and 

62
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:12,631
you decide,
well,

63
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:13,150
first of all,
you're paralyzed.

64
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,630
You think,
well,

65
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:16,630
how do I know if I should pursue that?
It's probably a stupid idea,

66
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,480
and the proper response to that is,
you're right.

67
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,480
It probably is a stupid idea because 
almost all the all ideas are stupid and 

68
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,101
so the probability that as you move 
forward on your adventure that you're 

69
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:31,270
going to get it right.
The first time is zero.

70
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,540
It's just not going to happen,
and so then you might think,

71
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:39,541
well,
maybe I'll just wait around until I get 

72
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:39,700
the right idea and which people do.
Right?

73
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,980
So they're like 40 year old,
13 year olds,

74
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:46,981
which is not a good idea.
So they wait around until it's waiting 

75
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:48,610
for Godot until they finally got it 
right.

76
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:51,250
But the problem is you're too stupid to 
know when you've got it right.

77
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:56,251
So waiting around isn't going to help 
because even if the perfect opportunity 

78
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:59,410
manifested itself to you in your 
incomplete form,

79
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,670
the probability that you would recognize
it as the perfect opportunity is zero.

80
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,820
You might even think it's the worst 
possible idea that you've ever heard of 

81
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,010
anywhere,
highly likely,

82
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,120
highly likely.

83
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,060
So,
so you ha,

84
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,990
there's a niche,
a niche called that,

85
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:14,390
uh,
will,

86
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,900
will to stupidity,
which I really liked.

87
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,620
So because he thought of stupidity as 
being,

88
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,050
you know,
it's,

89
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:26,051
it's,
you have to take it into account 

90
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:26,051
fundamentally and work with it.
And so,

91
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,500
and so you can take these tentative 
steps on your pathway to destiny and you

92
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:34,120
can assume that you're going to do it 
badly.

93
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,390
And that's really useful because you 
don't have to beat yourself up.

94
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:40,210
It's pretty easy to do it badly.
But the thing is,

95
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:42,790
it's way better to do it badly the not 
to do it at all.

96
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,850
And that's the continual message that 
echoes through these historical stories 

97
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:50,740
in genesis.
It's like these are flawed people.

98
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,920
They should have got the hell out of 
their house way before they did.

99
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,220
Um,
and they go out and they stumble around 

100
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,310
in tyranny and feminine self betrayal 
and,

101
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,800
and violence.

102
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,800
And,
but it's a hell of a lot better than 

103
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:07,800
just rotting away at home.
And that's the,

104
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,420
that's great.
So that's good and so why is that?

105
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:10,990
Well,
okay,

106
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:15,991
so you,
you start your path and you think that 

107
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:18,121
you're heading towards your star and so 
you go in that direction and then 

108
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,690
because you're here,
the world looks a particular way,

109
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:27,691
but then when you move here,
the world looks different and you're 

110
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:29,530
different as a consequence of having 
made that voyage.

111
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:34,531
And so what that means is that now that 
thing that glimmers in front of you is 

112
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:38,611
going to have shifted its location 
because you weren't very good at 

113
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:42,280
specifying it to begin with and now that
you're a little sharper and more focused

114
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:47,281
than you were,
it's going to reveal itself with more 

115
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,570
accuracy to you.
And so then you have to take a,

116
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,130
you know,
it's almost like 180 degree reversal,

117
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,650
but it isn't because you know,
you've,

118
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,720
I mean you've gone this far and that's a
long ways to get that far,

119
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,320
but that's a lot farther than you would 
be if you just stayed where you were 

120
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,140
waiting.

121
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,950
And so it doesn't matter that you 
overshoot continually because as you 

122
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:20,771
overshoot,
even if you don't learn what you 

123
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:24,431
should've done,
you're going to continually learn what 

124
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:27,161
you shouldn't keep doing.
And if you learn enough about what you 

125
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:31,571
shouldn't keep doing,
then that's tantamount at some point to 

126
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:32,810
learning at the same time what you 
should be doing.

127
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,680
So it's okay.
So it's like this.

128
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,960
Now what's cool about it though,
I think is that as you progress,

129
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:45,710
the degree of overshooting starts to 
decline,

130
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:50,711
right?
And that we know that there's nothing 

131
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:50,990
hypothetical about that.
As you learn a new skill,

132
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,030
like even to play it,
play a song on the piano,

133
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:54,800
for example,
you overshoot madly,

134
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,600
you're making all sorts of mistakes to 
begin with.

135
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:01,601
And then the mistakes they disappear.
There's a great ted talk,

136
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:10,301
I think it was about this guy a up a 
really advanced computational recording 

137
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:15,221
system in his home and recorded every 
single utterance his young child made 

138
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,970
while learning to speak.

139
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,120
And then he put together the child's 
attempts to say certain phonemes and put

140
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:27,710
them in list and you can hear the child 
deviating madly to begin with.

141
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,110
And then after hundreds and hundreds of 
repetitions,

142
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:35,111
just zeroing right in on the exact 
phoneme so you know you might not know 

143
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,920
this,
but when kids babble,

144
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:38,810
because they start babbling when they're
quite young,

145
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:44,020
they babble every human phoneme 
including all sorts of phonemes that 

146
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,221
adults can't say,
and then they they die into their 

147
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:50,930
language so that after they learned,
say English,

148
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:53,840
then there's all sorts of phonemes they 
can no longer here or pronounced,

149
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,250
but to begin with,
it's all there.

150
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,410
Just really quite interesting.
But so they Z,

151
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,740
as they learn a particular language,
they zero in on the proper way to 

152
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,090
pronounce that and their errors 
minimize.

153
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:07,490
And every time you learn something,
that's how it is.

154
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:12,491
And that's really useful to know too 
because it means that it's okay to 

155
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,870
wander around stupidly before you fix 
your destination.

156
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,270
Now you see that echoed in exodus,
right?

157
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,660
Because what happens is that the 
Egyptians or the Hebrews escape 

158
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,480
materiality,
which is kind of whatever you do 

159
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,410
personally and psychologically,
when you escape from your previous set 

160
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,270
of stupidly held and ignorant and 
stubborn axioms,

161
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,280
it's like away from that tyranny.
It's like,

162
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,870
great.
I freed myself from that.

163
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,360
Well then what?
Well you think,

164
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:39,350
well,
now I'm on the way.

165
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:39,980
It's no,
you're not.

166
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:43,490
Now you're in the desert where you 
wander around stupidly,

167
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,750
you know and worship the wrong things 
until you finally organize yourself 

168
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,080
morally again and head in the proper 
direction,

169
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,750
so that's worth knowing too because you 
think,

170
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,550
well,
I got rid of a lot of things,

171
00:08:56,551 --> 00:09:01,551
baggage,
excess baggage that I didn't need in my 

172
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:01,551
life,
and now everything's okay.

173
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:01,551
It's like,
no,

174
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:05,871
it's not.
You've got rid of a whole set of 

175
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:06,930
scaffolds that were keeping you in place
even though they were pathological.

176
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,140
Now you have nothing and nothing 
actually turns out to be better than 

177
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,161
something pathological,
but you're still stuck with the problem 

178
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:17,350
of nothing,
and that's well,

179
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:20,040
that's exactly why exodus is structured 
the way that it is.

180
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,830
It's that you escaped from maturity.
It's hooray.

181
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,210
We're no longer slaves.
Yeah,

182
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:28,680
well now you're nihilistic and lost.
It's not necessarily an improvement,

183
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,950
but it is,
but it is the pre.

184
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,230
See,
it's also useful to know that because 

185
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,260
you can also be diluted into the idea 
that imagine that you're trying to 

186
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,680
become enlightened,
which might mean to turn all those parts

187
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,810
of you on that could be turned on.
You think,

188
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:44,940
well,
that's just a linear pathway uphill.

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,220
You know,
it's just from one success to another.

190
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:48,120
It's no,
it's not.

191
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,450
It's like here you are and you're not 
doing too badly in the first step is a 

192
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:53,450
complete bloody catastrophe.

193
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,010
It's worse and then maybe you can pull 
yourself together and you hit a new 

194
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,660
plateau and then that crumbles and 
shakes and bang.

195
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:05,661
It's worse again and so because part of 
the reason that people don't become 

196
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:09,621
enlightened is because it's punctuated 
by intermittent deserts essentially by 

197
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:13,050
intermittent catastrophes,
and if you don't know that well,

198
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:18,051
then you're basically screwed because 
you go ahead on your movement forward 

199
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:18,630
and you collapse and you think,
well,

200
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:19,980
that didn't work.
I collapsed.

201
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:20,760
It's like,
no,

202
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,290
that's par for the course.
It's not indication that you failed.

203
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,130
It's just indication that it's really 
hard and that when you learn something,

204
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:34,131
you also unlearn something and the thing
you unlearned is probably useful and 

205
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:35,160
unlearning it actually is painful.
You know,

206
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:37,260
let's say if you have to get out of a 
bad relationship,

207
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,230
it's like not every,
not any real.

208
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,930
There isn't any relationship that's a 
hundred percent bad,

209
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,500
and so when you jump out of it,
well maybe you're in better shape,

210
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:49,020
but you're still lonesome and 
disoriented and you don't know what your

211
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,910
past was and you don't know what your 
present isn't.

212
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,580
He don't want know what your future is.
It's that's not.

213
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,500
That's why people stay with the devil 
they know instead of you know,

214
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,030
looking for the devil they don't know 
so,

215
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,350
so anyways,
the fact that you're full of faults 

216
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,600
doesn't mean you have to stop and thank 
God for that.

217
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:14,601
That's a really useful thing and the 
fact that you're full of faults doesn't 

218
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:18,471
mean that you can't learn and so you can
pause it in an ideal and you're going to

219
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:23,631
be wrong about it,
but it doesn't matter because what 

220
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:23,850
you're right about his positing,
the ideal moving towards it,

221
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,240
if the actual ideal is conceptualized 
perfectly well first surprise,

222
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,190
surprise,
because like what are you going to do?

223
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:37,191
That's perfect.
So it doesn't matter that it's 

224
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:37,191
imperfect,
imperfect,

225
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:38,910
it just matters that you do it and that 
you move forward.

226
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,120
So that's really,
that's really positive news as far as 

227
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm concerned because you could actually
do that,

228
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,180
right?
You can do it badly.

229
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,130
Anyone can do that.
So that's,

230
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,920
that's useful.
Okay.

231
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:53,910
So like if you were an efficient person,
you would have just done that but you're

232
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,350
not.
But who cares,

233
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:56,680
you know,
and you still end up in the,

234
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,660
in the same place and maybe the trip is 
even more interesting.

235
00:12:00,661 --> 00:12:02,400
Who knows?
Probably too interesting.
