00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,910
Hello,
Dr Peter says,

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:01,930
Hey,
there we go.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,700
That's a night.
I'd like to ask you about two different 

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,381
psychological disorders.
The first being borderline personality 

5
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:11,770
disorder,
so two lectures ago,

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,270
somebody asks you about it and you gave 
very sparse answer.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,510
I can't remember exactly what you said,
but it seemed like it was a of it,

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,630
there was too much complexity to just 
answer it right there and then,

9
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:30,631
and then somebody else.
All Cox asked you about the same 

10
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:33,400
disorder in your Patriot on live stream 
recently and when they,

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,430
when they asked you that you kind of,
you kind of stopped for a moment and 

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,050
something I don't know,
something kind of flicked on in your 

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,751
head and it seemed like in you and you 
thought for a couple seconds and then 

14
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:45,910
you said,
you know what,

15
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:49,840
I don't think that I can answer that 
right now because it's just too,

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,930
it's just too bloody complex.
And I was wondering,

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,160
uh,
just like,

18
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:59,610
uh,
many young men have gravitated towards 

19
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,941
your lectures.
Do you think that there's something 

20
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:04,771
about this particular disorder that a,
there's something about people with this

21
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:09,850
particular disorder that might gravitate
to your insights and your lectures?

22
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,340
Okay.
Okay.

23
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:14,370
So now I would say probably no to the 
second one,

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,460
but I could comment more about 
borderline personality disorder.

25
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,800
I think I have enough mental energy to 
do that tonight.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,280
So technically speaking,
it's often considered the female variant

27
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:29,780
of antisocial personality disorder.
So it's,

28
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:30,470
it's,
it's,

29
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,490
it's classified or it's classified in 
the domain of externalizing disorders,

30
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:40,050
acting out disorders,
and I think what happens,

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,160
we don't understand borderline 
personality disorder very well mean.

32
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:47,850
It's characterized by tremendous 
impulsivity,

33
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:56,110
radical confusion of identity and then 
this pattern of idealization of,

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,880
of people with whom the person afflicted
with a disorder is associated with 

35
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:08,730
radical idealization of those people and
then radical devaluation of them.

36
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,150
And then there's another theme that sort
of weaves along with it,

37
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:17,151
which is the proclivity of people with 
borderline personality disorder to 

38
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:22,581
presumed that they will be abandoned and
then to act in a manner that makes such 

39
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:28,011
abandonment virtually certain.
And so it's a very complicated disorder,

40
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:34,731
but that I think gets at the crux of it.
One of the things that's interesting 

41
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:40,761
about people with borderline personality
disorder and my experience is that 

42
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:44,511
they're often quite intelligent and you 
see in the person with borderline 

43
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:48,690
personality disorder,
something like that,

44
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,750
the waste or the squandering of 
tremendous potential,

45
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,930
they seem capable of thinking through 
the nature of their problems and 

46
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,901
analyzing them and discussing it,
but not capable whatsoever of 

47
00:03:02,901 --> 00:03:03,130
implementing any solutions.

48
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:04,640
And

49
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,960
technically there's no relationship 
between Iq and conscientiousness.

50
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,170
It's very weird because if you read the 
neuropsychological literature and you 

51
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:27,350
read about the functions of the 
prefrontal Cortex,

52
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:32,351
they're usually conceptualized in 
intellectual terms and they're 

53
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:34,010
associated with planning and 
strategizing and so forth.

54
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,180
And

55
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,490
that's what conscientiousness is,
is planning and strategizing and 

56
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,550
implementation.
But the correlation between Iq and 

57
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,431
conscientiousness is zero.
And so as the correlation between 

58
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:52,210
working memory and conscientiousness,
zero and zero is a very low correlation.

59
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,670
Right?
I mean really it's hard to find things 

60
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,670
in psychology that are correlated at 
zero.

61
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,620
Things tend to be correlated to some 
degree.

62
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:05,621
They tend to be interrelated.
The borderline seems to be able to 

63
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:10,190
strategize and to abstract,
but not to be able to implement

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,030
and

65
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,370
and so this,
the intellect per se seems to be 

66
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,750
functional,
but it's not embodied in action.

67
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,090
It's very so it can be frustrating to be
associated with someone who has 

68
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,151
borderline personality disorder because 
they can tell you what the problem is 

69
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:31,180
and even tell you what the solution 
might be,

70
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:33,070
but there's no implementation.

71
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:33,930
Okay,

72
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,470
so maybe something went wrong 
developmentally.

73
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,990
We don't know exactly how these sorts of
things come about.

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,500
The other thing that seems to be 
characteristic of borderline people with

75
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:49,501
borderline personality disorder is that 
they remind me very much of people who 

76
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:54,061
are two years old and in some manner 
like people with borderline personality 

77
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:56,830
disorder can have temper tantrums.
In fact,

78
00:04:56,831 --> 00:05:01,831
they often do and you know now and then 
you see a temper tantrum and they're 

79
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:02,680
usually thrown by two year olds.
Right?

80
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,950
Most people grow out of temper tantrums 
by the time they were about three.

81
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,770
They're very rare at four,
which is a good thing because if they're

82
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:12,220
still there at four,
that is not a good diagnostic predictor.

83
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,030
That's a good diagnostic predictor,
but it's not the kind that you want and 

84
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:23,581
you know,
it's funny the way that we respond to 

85
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:26,161
two year old temper tantrums because the
two year old will throw themselves on 

86
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:29,461
the ground and eat their hands and their
legs on the floor and scream and yell 

87
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:30,220
and turn red or even blue.

88
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,250
I saw a child once who was capable of 
holding his breath during a temper 

89
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,060
tantrum until he turned blue,
which was really an impressive feat.

90
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,260
You should try that,
right?

91
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:43,261
It's really hard because you really have
to work at it and you see that in adult 

92
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,250
borderlines.
They'll have temper tantrums.

93
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:47,290
And the funny thing is when a two year 
old does it,

94
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,310
it's like it's,
you know,

95
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:52,360
it's a little off putting,
but when an adult does it,

96
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,630
it's completely bloody terrifying and it
happens very frequently with 

97
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,110
borderlines.
And so I would also say to some degree,

98
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,860
they didn't get properly socialized 
between that critical period of 

99
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,711
development between two and four.
And you see the same thing with adult 

100
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:12,251
males who grow up to be antisocial 
because a large proportion of adult 

101
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:14,570
males who grow up to be anti social are 
aggressive as children,

102
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,710
as two year olds.

103
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,010
And so there's a small proportion of two
year olds who are quite aggressive.

104
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:24,011
They'll kick and hit and bite and steal 
if you put them with other two year 

105
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:27,011
olds,
it's about five percent of the of the 

106
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:27,011
males,
smaller fraction of the females,

107
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,330
but most of them are socialized by the 
time they're four,

108
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,380
but there's a small percentage who 
aren't and they tend to stay anti social

109
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:35,360
and they tend to turn into longterm 
offenders.

110
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,810
And and the,
the critical period for socialization 

111
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,871
development seems to be between two and 
four and it seems to be mediated by 

112
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,560
pretend play in rough and tumble play in
those sorts of mechanisms.

113
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,930
And if it isn't instantiated by the age 
of four,

114
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,370
it doesn't happen and it doesn't look 
like it's addressable.

115
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,340
Now,
there are dialectic behavioral therapies

116
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,360
that have been developed for people with
borderline personality disorder and 

117
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,360
their purported to be successful.
