1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Do you know if you take people,
and I've told you this and you expose 

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,100
them voluntarily to things that they are
avoiding and are afraid of,

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,130
you know,
that they know they need to overcome in 

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:12,130
order to meet their goals,
their self defined goals.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,790
If you can teach people to stand up in 
the face of the things they're afraid 

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,241
of,
they get stronger and you don't know 

7
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:23,211
what the upper limits to that art 
because you might ask yourself like if 

8
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:26,481
for 10 years if you didn't avoid doing 
what you knew you needed to do by the 

9
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:27,690
depth,
by your own definitions,

10
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:32,691
right?
Within the value structure that you've 

11
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:32,691
created,
to the degree that you've done that,

12
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:35,430
what would you be like?
Well,

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,640
you know,
there are remarkable people who come 

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,411
into the world from time to time and 
there are people who do find out over 

15
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:45,450
decades long periods what they could be 
like if they were who they were.

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,690
If they said if they spoke their being 
forward and they get stronger and 

17
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:54,210
stronger and stronger and we don't know 
the limits to that.

18
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:56,700
We do not know the limits to that.
And so you could say,

19
00:00:56,701 --> 00:01:01,701
well,
in part perhaps the reason that you're 

20
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:03,441
suffering unbearably can be left at your
feet because you're not everything you 

21
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:06,240
could be and you know it.
And of course that's a terrible thing to

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,490
admit and it's a terrible thing to 
consider,

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,680
but there's real promise in it,
right?

24
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:15,681
Because it means that perhaps there's 
another way that you could look at the 

25
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:18,390
world and the number another way that 
you could act in the world.

26
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:23,391
So what it would reflect back to you,
it'd be much better than what it 

27
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:24,600
reflects back to you now.
And then the second part of that is,

28
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:29,601
well,
imagine that many people did that 

29
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:29,601
because we've done a lot as human 
beings.

30
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:32,250
We've done a lot of remarkable things.
And I've told you already,

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,320
I think before that today,
for example,

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,590
about 250,000
people will be lifted out of abject 

33
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,660
poverty.
And about 300,000

34
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:42,750
people attached to the electrical power 
grid we're making.

35
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:47,751
People were lifting people out of 
poverty collectively at a faster rate 

36
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,860
that's ever occurred in the history of 
humankind by a huge margin.

37
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,580
And that's been going on unbelievably 
quickly since the year 2000.

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,120
The UN had planned to have poverty 
between 2000 and 2015 and it was 

39
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,840
accomplished by 2013.
So there's inequality developing in many

40
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:06,690
places and you hear lots of political 
agitation about that.

41
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,900
But overall the tide is lifting everyone
up and now it's a great thing and we 

42
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,461
have no idea how fast we can multiply 
that if people got their act together 

43
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:17,490
and really aimed at it.
Because you know,

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,500
my,
my experience is with people that were 

45
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,790
probably running at about 51 percent of 
our capacity.

46
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,980
Something mean you can think about this 
yourselves.

47
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,190
I often ask undergraduates how many 
hours a day you waste or how many hours 

48
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,051
a week you waste.
The classic answer is something like 

49
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:36,120
four to six hours a day.
You know,

50
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:40,320
inefficient studying,
watching things on youtube that not only

51
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,870
do you not want to watch,
that you don't even care about that make

52
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,300
you feel horrible about watching.
After you're done,

53
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,630
that's probably four hours right there.
Now you think,

54
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:51,180
well that's 20,
25 hours a week.

55
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:54,300
It's 100 hours a month,
that's two and a half full work weeks.

56
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,480
It's half a year of work weeks per year,
and if your time is worth $20 an hour,

57
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,100
which is a radical underestimate.
It's probably more like 50.

58
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,500
If you think about it in terms of 
deferred wages,

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,850
if you're wasting 20 hours a week,
you're wasting $50,000

60
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:14,851
a year and you are doing that right now 
and it's because you're young wasting 

61
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:19,201
$50,000
a year as a way bigger catastrophe than 

62
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:20,350
it would be for me to waste it because 
I'm not going to last nearly as long and

63
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:22,150
so if your life isn't everything,
it could be.

64
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,260
You could ask yourself,
well,

65
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,410
what would happen if you just stopped 
wasting the opportunities that are in 

66
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,101
front of you?
You be who knows how much more 

67
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:32,830
efficient,
10 times more efficient,

68
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,370
20 times more efficient.
That's the prieto distribution.

69
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,700
You have no idea how efficient,
efficient people get.

70
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,280
It's completely.
It's off the charts

71
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,520
well and if we all got our act together 
collectively and stopped making things 

72
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,390
worse because that's another thing 
people do all the time.

73
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,570
Not only do they not do what they should
to make things better,

74
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,690
they actively attempt to make things 
worse because they're spiteful or 

75
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,961
resentful or arrogant or deceitful or or
homicidal or genocidal or all of those 

76
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:09,180
things all bundled together in an 
absolutely pathological package.

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,380
If people stopped really,
really trying just to make things worse,

78
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,470
we have no idea how much better they 
would get just because of that.

79
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,280
So there's this weird dynamic that's 
part of the existential system of ideas 

80
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,630
between human vulnerability,
social judgment,

81
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,910
both of which are are,
are,

82
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,120
are major causes of suffering and the 
failure of individuals to adopt the 

83
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,200
responsibility that they know they 
should adopt.

84
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,180
And that's the thing that's interesting 
too,

85
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:41,181
is that like one of the,
another thing I've asked often asked my 

86
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,510
undergraduate classes is,
you know,

87
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,540
there's this idea that people have that 
people have a conscience and you know 

88
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,780
what the conscience is.

89
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,780
It's,
it's this feeling or voice you have in 

90
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,530
your head just before you do something 
that you know is stupid,

91
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:59,040
telling you that probably you shouldn't 
do that stupid thing.

92
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,830
You don't have to listen to it strangely
enough.

93
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,310
But you go ahead and do it anyways,
and then of course exactly what the 

94
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,420
conscience told you was going to happen 
inevitably happens so that you feel even

95
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:12,150
stupider about it than you would if it 
happened by accident.

96
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,970
Because you know,
I knew this was going to happen.

97
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,150
I got a warning.
It was gonna happen and I went and did 

98
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,911
it anyways.
And the funny thing too is that that 

99
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:25,131
conscience operates within people and we
really don't understand what the hell 

100
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:25,131
that is.

101
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,500
So you might say,
well,

102
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:31,501
what would happen if you abided by your 
conscience for five years or for 10 

103
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:32,410
years?
What sort of position might you be in?

104
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:37,411
What sort of family might you have?
What sort of relationship might you be 

105
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:40,801
able to forge?
And you can be bloody sure that a 

106
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:43,471
relationship that's forged on the basis 
of who you actually are is going to be a

107
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:48,721
lot stronger and more welcome than one 
that's forged on the basis of who you 

108
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:48,850
aren't.
Now,

109
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:53,851
of course,
that means that the person you're with 

110
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:55,621
has to deal with the full force of you 
in all your ability and your 

111
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,830
catastrophe.
And that's a very,

112
00:05:56,831 --> 00:06:00,860
very thing to negotiate,
but if you do negotiate it well,

113
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,861
at least you have something,
you have somewhere solid to stand and 

114
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:09,671
you have somewhere to live.
You have a real life and it's a great 

115
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:11,120
basis upon which to bring children into 
the world,

116
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:16,121
for example,
because you can have an actual 

117
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:16,310
relationship with them instead of 
torturing them half to death,

118
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:21,311
which is what happens in a tremendous,
a tremendously large minority of cases.

119
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,490
Well,
it's more than that too because,

120
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:28,520
and this is what I'll close with and 
this is why I wanted to introduce social

121
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,930
units since readings to you,
you see,

122
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,230
because it isn't merely that your fate 
depends on whether or not you get your 

123
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:40,091
act together and to what degree you 
decide that you're going to live out 

124
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:42,470
your own genuine being.
It isn't only your fate,

125
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,170
it's the fate of everyone that you're 
networked with.

126
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,700
And so you know,
you think,

127
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:49,010
well,
there's 9 billion,

128
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:54,070
7 billion people in the world.
We're going to peak at about $9 billion 

129
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,500
by the way.
And then it'll decline rapidly,

130
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:57,050
but 7 billion people in the world.
And who are you?

131
00:06:57,051 --> 00:07:00,290
You're just one little dust mote among 
that 7 billion,

132
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,540
and so it really doesn't matter what you
do or don't do,

133
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:07,541
but that's simply not the case.
It's the wrong model because you're at 

134
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,280
the center of a network,
you're a node in a network.

135
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,010
Of course that's even more true now that
we have social media.

136
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,190
You'll,
you'll know a thousand people at least 

137
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,831
over the course of your life and they'll
know a thousand people each and that 

138
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,330
puts you one person away from a million 
and two persons away from a billion.

139
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,840
And so that's how you're connected and 
the things you do.

140
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,400
They're like dropping a stone in a pond.
The ripples move outward and they effect

141
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:34,370
things in ways that you can't fully 
comprehend.

142
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:39,371
And it means that the things that you do
and that you don't do are far more 

143
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:39,680
important than you think.

144
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,840
And so if you act that way,
of course,

145
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:46,830
the terror of realizing that is that it 
actually starts to matter what you do.

146
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:51,831
And you might say,
well that's better than living a 

147
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:51,840
meaningless existence.
It's better for it to matter.

148
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,940
But I mean,
if you really asked yourself,

149
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,040
would you be so sure if you had the 
choice,

150
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,890
I can live with no responsibility 
whatsoever.

151
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:04,070
The price I pay is that nothing matters 
or I can reverse it and everything 

152
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,721
matters,
but I have to take the responsibility 

153
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,691
that's associated with that.
It's not so obvious to me that people 

154
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:11,691
would take the meaningful path.

155
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,280
No.
When you say,

156
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:18,281
well,
nihilists suffer dreadfully because 

157
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:18,281
there's no meaning in their life and 
they still suffer.

158
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:18,281
Yeah,
but the advantages,

159
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:21,340
they have no responsibility.
So that's the payoff.

160
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,090
And I actually think that's the 
motivation.

161
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:23,390
Say,
well,

162
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:26,390
I can't help being nihilistic.
All my belief systems have collapsed.

163
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:27,170
It's like,
yeah,

164
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:32,171
maybe.
Maybe you've just allowed them to 

165
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:34,631
collapse because it's a hell of a lot 
easier than acting them out and the 

166
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:34,631
price you pay is a meaningless 
suffering,

167
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:39,371
but you can always whine about that and 
people will feel sorry for you and you 

168
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:39,560
have the option of taking the pathway of
the martyr.

169
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,840
So that's a pretty good deal.
All things considered,

170
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,080
especially when the.
When the alternative is to bear your 

171
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,060
burdens properly into live forthrightly 
in the world,

172
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:52,580
well,
what Solzhenitsyn figured out in so many

173
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:54,800
people in the 20th century,
it's not just him,

174
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:59,760
even though he's the best example,
is that if you live a pathological life,

175
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,900
you pathologize your society,
and if enough people do that,

176
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:08,520
then it's held really,
really,

177
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,860
and you can read the Gulag archipelago.
If you have the fortitude to do that and

178
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:18,861
you'll see exactly what hell is like,
and then you can decide if that's a 

179
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:20,100
place you'd like to visit or even more 
importantly,

180
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:25,101
if it's a light.
If it's a place you'd like to visit and 

181
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:27,801
take all your family and friends because
that's what happened in the 20th 

182
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:27,801
century.
