1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,980
Part of spiritual development is to 
recognize the satanic tendencies that 

2
00:00:05,991 --> 00:00:10,991
characterize you and to fully wrestle 
with them and to and to integrate them.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,830
That's the thing.
It's not so much to cast them away,

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,140
it's to transmute them,
you know,

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,280
and you can see the difference between 
people who've done that and people who 

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,741
haven't,
at least to some degree because people 

7
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:29,471
who haven't integrated the shadow at all
are naive and you can tell that when you

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:34,571
look at them and you can tell that when 
you talk to them and because they're 

9
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:38,171
naive,
they're often resentful as well because 

10
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:38,930
they get taken advantage of it and 
someone who's integrated that more,

11
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:42,890
they're dangerous in the martial arts 
sort of way,

12
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:45,380
which is they're dangerous,
but they don't have to be.

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,770
They don't have to use it because their 
presence radiates.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,180
What would you say it?
It doesn't radiate threat.

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,850
Exactly.
Well certainly strength,

16
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:01,330
but it's.
It's,

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,600
it's,
it's the potential for havoc.

18
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,000
That's the right way of thinking about 
it.

19
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,450
There's a,
there's an implicit potential for havoc 

20
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,530
and that's really necessary.
It,

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,720
it.
One of the things that gives people self

22
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:20,721
respect,
this is an interesting thing about the 

23
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:22,651
integration of the shadow because 
recognizing yourself as the locus of 

24
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,170
evil,
let's say actually in some sense gives 

25
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,151
you far more respect for yourself 
strangely enough because the same 

26
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:35,740
respect that you might have for a wild 
animal or even a monster.

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,710
It's like in those so then maybe you 
learn to treat yourself differently like

28
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,810
I think this is particularly true with 
regards to the discipline of children.

29
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:49,330
You know,
if you know that you're a monster and 

30
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,011
that that will manifest itself in your 
life consciously or unconsciously and 

31
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:53,330
unconsciously,
it's,

32
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:54,520
it's,
it's not good,

33
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,530
then you become better at disciplining 
children and the reason for that is that

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,860
you don't want to expose them to your 
dark side.

35
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,400
And so if they behave and don't provoke 
you,

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,800
which means they'll also behave for 
other people,

37
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:14,070
then you don't.
The monstrous part can stay in abeyance 

38
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,420
and then that's great,
but if you don't understand yourself as 

39
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,921
capable of wreaking havoc,
and that can be the kind of havoc that 

40
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:22,921
unfolds over decades,
right?

41
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:24,640
Because if you're going to abuse a 
child,

42
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,330
it's the primitive form of abuse,
the physical abuse,

43
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,540
the sophisticated form of abuse is the 
continual undermining of the child's 

44
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,651
courage across perhaps their entire life
and that there's a terribly monstrous 

45
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:42,781
element to that,
and if you're not respected properly by 

46
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:48,061
the child,
say you will absolutely take revenge on 

47
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:50,470
them and you know that's a whole in some
sense,

48
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,720
that's the whole Freudian psychoanalytic
story.

49
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:55,390
It's just not all of it,
but it's a huge part of it.

50
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,430
So interesting that you say that you 
have to the fact that you're dangerous

51
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,120
or become dangerous.
Because I'd also say that if you haven't

52
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:09,121
done that kind of shadow work,
if you haven't made friends with your 

53
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:09,121
anger,
if you haven't integrated it,

54
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:12,070
you're actually more dangerous because 
then things will happen that will.

55
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,770
It will come out in a way that you don't
to.

56
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,830
Right.
It comes out disintegrated.

57
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,800
So it comes out as an autonomous spirit,
right?

58
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:21,920
Under no one's control and that's like a
burst of rage.

59
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:23,450
Let's say.
You know,

60
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,480
when you,
when you hear about a mother who's done 

61
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:28,480
something terrible to one of her 
children,

62
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:28,760
it's,
that's the reason is that,

63
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,680
you know,
she,

64
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:35,770
maybe she's just been laid off.
Maybe she went out and had too much to 

65
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,650
drink.
Maybe she's hung over,

66
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,150
you know,
she's,

67
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,590
she's angry and lonesome and she's 
overwhelmed by the responsibility of the

68
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:47,591
children and she has a child who's 
testing and she doesn't know how to 

69
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:52,961
limit it.
And one day the child tests at exactly 

70
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:55,670
the wrong time and it's like mayhem and 
everybody goes,

71
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:56,540
well,
what happened?

72
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,320
It's like,
well,

73
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,430
seven terrible things came together at 
the same time and produced this outburst

74
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:09,701
of disintegrated rage and like,
look the hell out when that happens.

75
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,200
You know?
So yeah,

76
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,270
you want to have that.
You either you either have that or it 

77
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:22,091
has you.
Those are the options and you don't 

78
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,360
become safe by being castrated.
