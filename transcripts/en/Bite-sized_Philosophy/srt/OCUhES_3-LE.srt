1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,910
First contributors to poverty are,
well,

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:05,410
it's not so good to have a low Iq.
You know,

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,730
people don't like the idea of Iq because
it seems so arbitrary,

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,750
you know,
have a high Iq.

5
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:15,210
Well it's not like you deserve it.
Exactly.

6
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:18,900
It's your setup that way pretty much 
right from the beginning.

7
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:20,340
It's very,
very,

8
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:21,900
very,
very stable.

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,170
You can make a high Iq person stupider 
by not educating them up to the level of

10
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:32,391
their possibility,
but taking someone who has a low Iq and 

11
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:35,571
trying to raise that.
It's like if you can figure out how to 

12
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:37,881
do that,
well you know it's Nobel prize time for 

13
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:40,770
you because people have tried that a lot
and most recently with those,

14
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:45,771
you know,
Luminol lumosity games and that sort of 

15
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:48,081
thing.
And the evidence that those produce 

16
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,470
anything other than brilliant 
performances on the lumosity game itself

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,260
is basically zero.
We haven't been able to figure out how 

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,201
to see because intelligence is across 
domain phenomena and you can get really 

19
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:06,321
good in a single domain by practicing 
like mad and what you'd want is to 

20
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:10,641
practice like mad in a single domain and
hope that it generalizes to other 

21
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:14,331
domains.
That's the holy grail of intelligence 

22
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:14,331
increase.
It's like,

23
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:15,870
no,
no one's done it.

24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,930
People claim it,
but the claims never hold up and people 

25
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,190
have been trying for a long time to do 
it and they haven't been able to do it.

26
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:23,820
And

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,020
differences in Iq really make a 
difference.

28
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,630
You know,
I mean you guys,

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,720
average Iq is probably one slash 25.
One 30 ad at 1:15.

30
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:44,751
You're at the 85th percentile and 1:15
would barely get you going for you.

31
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,170
For Harvard University,
1:30,

32
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,110
you're probably graduate school 
material,

33
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,610
you know,
1:45.

34
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,460
You're up there at the range where you 
can probably do pretty much whatever you

35
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:01,410
want.
Although as you get smarter,

36
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,870
the scatter between your abilities 
increase.

37
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,620
So you might have a very high verbal Iq 
but not be so good at mathematics or the

38
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,740
other way around,
but it's a massive contributor to 

39
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,741
lifetime success.
And I don't know what to do about that.

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,200
I mean why do smart people make more 
money?

41
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,620
Well they get to where the edge of 
production is faster.

42
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,340
So if you have a thousand people and you
rank order them by ICU,

43
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:32,750
the smart people are going to come up 
with a new ideas first and they're gonna

44
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,850
have more ideas and they're going to 
strategize better.

45
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,600
And you know,
with an Iq of 90,

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,960
which is 15 percent of the population,
you think about that 15 percent of the 

47
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:52,381
population.
That's pretty much the threshold for 

48
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,440
reading instructions and being able to 
follow them.

49
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,510
So you know,
and our society is increasingly 

50
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,440
sophisticated.
So it's by no means obvious.

51
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,780
You know,
the Liberals Think,

52
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:09,781
well society is unfair because there's 
unemployment and the Conservatives think

53
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,200
while there's a job for everyone,
but none of them think,

54
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,400
well,
there are massive,

55
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:20,401
massive,
massive differences in people's ability 

56
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:23,670
far greater than anyone realizes.
And that poses a structural problem.
