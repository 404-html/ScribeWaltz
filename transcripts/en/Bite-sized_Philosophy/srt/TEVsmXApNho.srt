1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
Now this,
the baboon here who's supposed to be 

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:05,760
basically just a fool.
When the story was first written,

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:10,761
he turned into what's essentially a 
shaman across time and so he represents 

4
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:15,441
the self from the union perspective.
Now the self is everything you could be 

5
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:19,611
across time,
so imagine that there's you and there's 

6
00:00:19,611 --> 00:00:22,611
the potential inside you.
Whatever that is and potential is an 

7
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:25,140
interesting idea because it's represents
something that isn't yet real.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,080
Yet we act like it's real because people
will say to you,

9
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:33,081
you should live up to your potential and
that potential is partly what you could 

10
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:37,281
be if you interacted with the world in a
manner that would gain you the most 

11
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:38,010
information,
right?

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,310
Because you build yourself out of the 
information in the piagetian sense,

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,550
but it's deeper than that too because we
know that if you take yourself and you 

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,851
put yourself in a new environment,
new genes turned on in your nervous 

15
00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:53,391
system,
they encode for new proteins and so 

16
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:53,391
you're full of biological potential.

17
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:58,340
That won't be realized unless you move 
yourself around in the world into 

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,780
different challenging circumstances and 
that'll turn on different circuits.

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,140
So it's not merely that you're 
incorporating information from the 

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,140
outside world in the constructivist 
sense,

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,640
it's that by exposing yourself to 
different environments,

22
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:13,641
you put different physiological demands 
on yourself all the way down to the 

23
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:17,190
genetic level and that manifests new 
elements of you.

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,530
And so one of the things that happens to
people,

25
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:22,020
and this is a very common cultural 
notion,

26
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,260
is that you should go on a pilgrimage at
some point to somewhere central in that 

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,521
would be say like the rock pride rock in
the lion king because you take yourself 

28
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:36,141
out of your dopey little village and 
that's just the little bounded you that 

29
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:36,780
everyone knows and that isn't very 
expanded.

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,680
And then you go somewhere dark and 
dangerous to the central place and while

31
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:43,260
you do that,
you have adventures and they toughen you

32
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,880
and pull more out of you.

33
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,880
Like partly because you're becoming 
informed,

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,180
which means information.
It means you're becoming more organized 

35
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,080
at every level of analysis.
But there's also more of you too.

36
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,070
And so that's a very classic idea.
And then in in cathedrals in Europe,

37
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:01,770
especially at charter,
there's a big maze on the floor,

38
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:06,771
a circular maize,
which is a symbolic representation of 

39
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:06,870
the pilgrimage for people who couldn't 
do it.

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,870
And so it's a huge circle divided into 
quadrants,

41
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:13,860
which is a union Mandela.
And you enter the maize at one point and

42
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:16,230
then you have to walk through the entire
maze north,

43
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,130
east,
west,

44
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,140
and south before you get to the center.
And the center is symbolized by a flower

45
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,120
that's carved in stone.
It looks like this.

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,070
It's big.
This maze,

47
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:27,630
hey,
it's large so that you can walk it.

48
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,720
And that's a symbolic pilgrimage.
It takes you to the center.

49
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,720
That's the center of the cross because 
it's in a cathedral.

50
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:37,080
And that's the point of acceptance,
of voluntary suffering.

51
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,110
That's what that means.
And so you walk through,

52
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,220
you can call that a circum ambulation.
You go to all the corridors of the world

53
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:48,250
to find yourself.
And so while the self is,

54
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,800
is the baboon in this particular,
in this pr,

55
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,180
I think he's a mandrill actually in this
particular representation.

56
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:56,910
And he lives in the tree.
He lives in the tree of life.

57
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:01,911
It's a bail bab tree in this particular,
so the spirit that inhabits the tree of 

58
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:05,110
life and he's the eternal wise man.
That's a way of thinking,

59
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,780
so is the king,
but he's.

60
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,330
He's sort of a superordinate king or an 
outside king in some sense.

61
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:14,560
He's the repository of ancient wisdom 
and the king is the manner in which that

62
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,950
wisdom is currently being acted out in 
the world and so their friends,

63
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:21,130
and that means that the king is a good 
king because if they,

64
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,330
if the king was a bad king,
he would be alienated from himself and 

65
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,881
that would make him shallow and one 
dimensional and that would make him a 

66
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:29,881
bad ruler.

67
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:31,450
No union with the traditions of the 
past.

68
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,660
To be a good ruler,
you have to rescue your father from the 

69
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,751
underworld and integrate that,
and of course that's a main theme in 

70
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:39,751
this entire movie.
