1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,990
For a long time I understood nihilism 
very well.

2
00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:07,991
I could,
I could understand its rationale 

3
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:11,020
associated with the tragedy of life 
associating with suffering and evil 

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,130
associated with the observation of 
finitude and the arbitrary and unjust 

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,910
nature of the world,
but the more I've thought about it,

6
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:20,900
the less I've come to believe that 
there's any excuse for it whatsoever,

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,040
and I think the reason for that is that 
it forestalls effort.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,640
It forestalls the ability to discover 
for yourself maybe there's no reason to 

9
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:36,440
be so God damn hopeless except that it's
easier to be useless now,

10
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:37,520
and I'm not.
Believe me,

11
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:42,521
I'm not making that case.
I'm not saying that that's what's be 

12
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:45,050
setting people who are clinically 
depressed,

13
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:47,090
for example.
That's not my point.

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,420
Clinical depression is a terrible thing.
There's lots of reasons to be rendered 

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to be,
to be tossed into a catastrophic 

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
condition.
That isn't what I mean.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,150
I mean that kind of cynical,
arrogant,

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,390
rational,
hyper-intelligent nihilism that throws 

19
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,081
the world away as if it's of little use 
before it's been properly engaged with

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,640
better to engage with it and see what 
happens and better to make the 

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,460
assumption that if the world isn't 
returning to you,

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,820
what it is that you need,
then either you're not doing it right or

23
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:25,760
you've conceptualized what you need 
badly.

24
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,320
Why not at least open yourself up to 
that possibility,

25
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,260
right?
Because you could be wrong.

26
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,550
Hopefully if you're suffering,
this is a great thing to know.

27
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,070
Hopefully if you're suffering,
you're wrong,

28
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,800
because if you're suffering and you're 
right,

29
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,180
then there's nowhere to go,
so it's very useful to find out whatever

30
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:52,181
errors you might be committing.
Another thing that's really interesting 

31
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:53,000
about the Jews in the Old Testament,
it's a remarkable thing.

32
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,970
Every single time they get flattened by 
God,

33
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,940
it's always their fault.
They never say,

34
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,410
the world that God created was corrupt 
and God is evil.

35
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:06,150
They never say that no matter what 
happens,

36
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:08,460
right,
no matter what catastrophe occurs,

37
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:13,140
when they have every reason to at least 
put that hypothesis forward,

38
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,210
they don't.
They say,

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,960
we aired,
we walked off the path,

40
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,140
it's our fault,
and that's hard,

41
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:27,141
you know,
because it puts all the weight of human 

42
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:27,141
catastrophe on the human being.
That's very hard,

43
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,530
but the upside is

44
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,700
it gives you the control.
It opens up the door that it opens up 

45
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,900
the possibility that you could be the 
person that could set it right.

46
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,840
If you would just let go of what's in 
your way,

47
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,670
whatever that is.
