1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,820
Being on forgetful to entertain 
strangers for thereby some have 

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,811
entertained angels unawares.
This is a commentary from Matthew Henry,

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,430
who is a nonconformist minister and 
author,

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,120
cheerful and obliging.
Manners in showing kindness are great,

5
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:19,990
ornaments to piety or are condescending.
Lord Vouch,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,290
safest,
not personal visits to us,

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,070
yet still by his spirit.
He stands at the door and knocks.

8
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:32,071
When we are inclined to open,
he deigns to enter by his gracious 

9
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:35,131
constellations.
He provides a rich feast of which we 

10
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:35,131
partake with him.

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,990
This is from revelations 3:20.
Behold,

12
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:43,991
I stand at the door and knock.
If any man hear my voice and open the 

13
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:47,321
door,
I will come into him and will sup with 

14
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:47,321
him and he with me.
Well,

15
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,350
the hyperlink nature of those quotes is 
quite obvious.

16
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,440
There's 10 or 15 things being said at 
the same time,

17
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:59,441
right?
One is a reference to the idea that if 

18
00:00:59,441 --> 00:00:59,441
you ask for something,
it will be given to you.

19
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:00,830
Right?
It was a very strange idea,

20
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:04,240
but I like that idea a lot and I believe
my,

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,440
in my experience,
that has been true.

22
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,830
If it was that I wanted what I was 
asking for because that's the real 

23
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,830
issue,
right,

24
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,360
because the question is if you want 
something,

25
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,570
what does it mean to want it and what it
means is to sacrifice whatever is 

26
00:01:19,971 --> 00:01:22,760
necessary to get it because otherwise 
you don't want it,

27
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,220
and so there's an equation here and I'm 
not claiming it's ultimate accuracy,

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:33,250
but the equation is something like you 
don't want it unless you're willing to 

29
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,540
sacrifice for it and if you don't want 
it,

30
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:38,210
you're not going to get it because 
you're scattered.

31
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,110
But if you do want at any make the 
proper sacrifices,

32
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:47,111
then God only knows what might happen 
and that's a c.

33
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:52,751
One of the things I really like about 
the existential philosophers is their 

34
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:58,061
emphasis on personal responsibility.
You know that many of them had an 

35
00:01:58,061 --> 00:02:01,481
emphasis on the role that people had in 
shaping their own destiny.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The exits for the existentialists,
and I think this was a consequence of 

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,410
the religious substructure,
of,

38
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,200
of philosophical thinking.
It was self evident that life was tragic

39
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,740
and bitter,
but and then fair enough,

40
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,770
but that isn't where it ended.
The next issue was,

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,750
well,
there are better ways,

42
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,640
better and worse ways of dealing with 
that,

43
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:27,641
and the better way of dealing with the 
fact that life is tragic and better is 

44
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:27,641
to

45
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,780
pause it,
the self you could be and live 

46
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,331
authentically in relationship to that 
and then the next issue and some.

47
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,380
This is something kierkegaard talked 
about,

48
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,980
particularly when he talked about the 
necessity of being a knight of faith,

49
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:46,981
is that the thing is,
and this is I think part of the light 

50
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:48,880
part of life that's the intractable 
adventure.

51
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,670
No one can take the adventure of life 
away from you,

52
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,240
that they can't do it with good advice,
for example,

53
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,510
because no one can demonstrate to you 
that if you straighten out a name at 

54
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,041
what you want and make the proper 
sacrifices that your life will turn out 

55
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,160
in the manner that you might want it to 
turn out.

56
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,390
It isn't in anyone else's purview to 
make that judgment.

57
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:14,380
The only person that can possibly figure
that out is you.

58
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,750
It's something that can't be stolen from
you.

59
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,750
I would say it's your destiny.
It's a destiny that cannot be stolen 

60
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,810
from you and you can forgo it.
You can say,

61
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:27,811
well,
I'm not willing to put in the effort 

62
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:27,811
because what if I fail?
Well,

63
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:28,090
first of all,
if you don't put in the effort,

64
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,150
you will fail because life is hard and 
it takes everything out of you to do it 

65
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:39,541
properly so you will fail and if you 
make the proper sacrifices,

66
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:45,151
you might fail.
That's why I like the ambiguity and the 

67
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:47,521
story of Cain and Abel because we're 
never really told why God rejects canes 

68
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:51,721
offerings.
There's hands that came maybe isn't 

69
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:52,090
doing as good a job as he should,
and he certainly gets bitter about it,

70
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,120
but there's no smoking pistol.
It doesn't say,

71
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,300
well,
Cain is a bad guy.

72
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,050
He made terrible sacrifices,
so god rejected him.

73
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,230
You never know.
Cain might've been working pretty damn 

74
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:04,230
hard and things still didn't work out 
for them,

75
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,611
and I think that ambiguity is 
appropriate in the story because that 

76
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:10,350
ambiguity ambiguity is in life.
You'd be.

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,400
You'd be a fool to say that everything 
always works out for everyone if they 

78
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,480
just do things right.
I mean,

79
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:19,390
I think that's a very,
that's a very careless thing to say,

80
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:23,170
given how much tragedy and catastrophe 
there is in the world and how much of it

81
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:26,830
seems to be undeserved,
but that still has very little bearing I

82
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:28,420
think on,
on,

83
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,230
on your own individual adventure and the
necessity for

84
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,900
the necessity for opening the door to 
who you could be and,

85
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,440
and the necessity to do that.
Seriously.

86
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,710
And I do believe and I think I,
I think that's why this most impossible 

87
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,460
of versus you know,
knock and the door will open.

88
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,820
Why that's believable is that I have 
never met anyone who couldn't 

89
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,950
hypothesize a better them in some 
manner.

90
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
All they had to do is ask.
It's like,

91
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,850
well,
how could you be better?

92
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,710
Thank well here's three ways.
It's like,

93
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,850
it's no problem,
right?

94
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:15,550
You can think about that no time flat.
Maybe it's small ways,

95
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,820
but you can almost always at least think
of something stupid that you're doing 

96
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,590
that you could quit.
And so that means that you do have this.

97
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,620
It's a strange thing and people that we 
have this built in capacity to pause it 

98
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,580
a higher self and then to move towards 
it and maybe maybe that's part of where 

99
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,171
the religious instinct really came from 
speaking like really reductionistically 

100
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,520
like as a materialist.
As an evolutionary psychologist,

101
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,490
we have this notion of the transcendent 
ideal,

102
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:47,491
right?
That that seems to be pervasive across 

103
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:47,491
cultures.
Well,

104
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:50,221
maybe that's the ultimate manifestation 
of the human proclivity to be able to 

105
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,790
pause it an ideal at all and to move 
forward.

106
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,840
You pause it.
An ideal,

107
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,330
okay.
That you need that to move forward.

108
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,380
Well,
if you can pause it,

109
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,220
an ideal,
why can't you pause it?

110
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,810
The ultimate ideal?
Well,

111
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:04,811
if you can then instantly you've got to 
religious sensibility instantly and so 

112
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:07,340
maybe that's because I've puzzled like 
as a biologist,

113
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:11,390
what the hell is the basis of the 
religious instinct because the idea that

114
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,570
it's mere superstition,
like we can just dispense with that.

115
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,060
That's a wrong.
It's a human universal.

116
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,730
You can evoke religious experiences all 
sorts of ways,

117
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,030
so we're not going to play that game.
There's some reason that that instinct 

118
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,751
exists and this the first thing to do 
with it is to try to reduce it to 

119
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:30,260
something that's biological and leave it
at that.

120
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,300
Not to mess with the metaphysics,
but it certainly could be the case that 

121
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,130
it's the ultimate extension of our 
capacity to pause it and ideal and we 

122
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:39,130
also might say,
well,

123
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,280
that's good enough because while the 
ideal moves you forward,

124
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:48,281
it fills your life with meaning.
There's no doubt about that because it 

125
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:50,981
is in the movement towards your ideal 
that life's meaning is to be attained 

126
00:06:50,981 --> 00:06:51,920
and then the question is,
well,

127
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:55,520
how much meaning is there in moving 
forward towards an ultimate ideal?

128
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:56,510
Well,
more meaning,

129
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,760
even though it's more difficult.
How much?

130
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,000
Well,
that's the open question.
