1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,920
Any more pages and stuff coming up.
Oh yeah.

2
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:02,510
Yeah,
of course.

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,260
Think with psm.
I mean,

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,730
I was saying this to him,
to his wife.

5
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:08,520
It's like when you're making music and 
writing and stuff,

6
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:11,400
oftentimes you quote the greats and you 
know,

7
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:15,090
you quote a hunter s Thompson or you're 
a young or whatever,

8
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,980
but they're all dead,
you know,

9
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:19,360
and they didn't.
They were already.

10
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:21,090
Or if there are audio recordings of 
them,

11
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:23,520
they're not very good and there aren't 
that many of them.

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,910
And here we have peterson like spitting 
fucking napalm on a daily basis,

13
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:31,980
like dropping,
laying in hours of audio everyday.

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,280
It's all fucking brilliant.
It's all incredibly valuable.

15
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:40,281
And it's also incredibly sonorous 
musical and beautiful and important and 

16
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:42,090
necessary right now.
If I did nothing else in my life,

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,120
even if I didn't even eat,
I could just sit there making peterson 

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,300
music forever because there's so much 
material.

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:48,930
So,
um,

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,620
I will continue to make Peterson stuff 
and it will continue to be useful when 

21
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,860
there's also many,
many other things to draw into music and

22
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:01,140
make useful in that fashion.
It's basically,

23
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:06,141
it appears to be a new genre or at least
a new way of sort of communicating ideas

24
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:09,720
and stuff and I've always done it.
I've always made mixed tapes that bought

25
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:13,350
in people talking and bringing in ideas 
and meeting musical.

26
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,450
Just like now there's a real big 
appetite for it and thanks to those 

27
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,400
lovely robots over at Youtube.
It's just an expanding universe of,

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,400
of a potential for people actually 
wanting to listen to it and being able 

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,811
to do it.
Isn't there will be a jd and low fi 

30
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:32,811
genre?
Well,

31
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:34,710
there is no other people are doing it 
now.

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,970
If you go,
if you go look it up,

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
there's actually loads of people doing 
it now to like varying degrees of 

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,670
success.
But lots of people are doing it and I've

35
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:43,920
been doing it with other things and 
it's,

36
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,280
it's called meaning wave now.
Um,

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,600
someone called it that in a car.
There was a genre.

38
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,460
It's now,
yeah,

39
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,090
it's a thing.
It's called meeting wave.

40
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,370
Uh,
it combines music,

41
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:59,700
aesthetics of low fire and vapor wave 
and vapor trap and,

42
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,770
and cloud rap and with meaningful spoken
stuff.

43
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,790
So it's not just peterson?
No,

44
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,850
it's now just,
it's Kinda like the intellectual dark 

45
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:11,850
web thing I guess.
But with music,

46
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,620
yeah,
struggle for power size each other up 

47
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:28,081
and elect the competent and they do that
at every level of society.

48
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,700
Side rail crew in southern Saskatchewan.
Rough guys,

49
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:41,701
like a lot of them have been in prison.
You know when you first came onto the 

50
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:45,821
rail crew,
you got a stupid nickname and people 

51
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:48,410
tease,
and I remember this one kid called 

52
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,940
lunchbox because he came to the rail 
crew with a lunch bucket that looked 

53
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:57,530
like his moment packed in.
That was a bad idea.

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,810
So they him lunch buckets,
but she wasn't very happy about.

55
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,390
That was a mistake.
He should have taken it with a smile and

56
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:09,620
then he was always to bowman if you 
asked him to do something even wide,

57
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,000
why

58
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,100
it's about 60 men on this stretched on 
the trucks.

59
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,490
Soon.
Anonymous philosophers were throwing 

60
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,470
pebbles out during her.
So on and so the gateway,

61
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,400
let's see if we can get that lunch 
bucket.

62
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,530
And that was purposeful because he 
didn't,

63
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,030
he couldn't take a job.
It's like,

64
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,420
well,
let's see if he could take this job,

65
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,220
and then it just got more and more 
peevish and the pebbles got bigger and 

66
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,641
bigger.
Learned anything from experience,

67
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,820
but you come.
It's like you take a job,

68
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,800
can you be useful?
Can you at least be amusing?

69
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,100
Is there something worthwhile?
No.

70
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,680
It's like,
okay,

71
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:18,681
well then you're rounding because you 
never know when we actually might need 

72
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:22,070
to depend on you.
