1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What role do women play in relationship 
to men or first they make themselves 

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,390
conscious?
Let's not ever forget about that because

3
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:11,391
the.
I would say the primary role that women 

4
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:13,761
have in relationship to men is to make 
them self conscious and men don't 

5
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:17,031
precisely like that.
There's nothing that will make a man 

6
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:18,150
more self conscious than being rejected 
and why?

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,180
Because why is he rejected?
Will obviously mother nature in the 

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,640
guise of that particular woman has said,
you're not so bad for a friend,

9
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:31,641
but there's no reason that your genetic 
material should propagate itself into 

10
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:31,641
the future.

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:36,690
Right?
Well,

12
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:38,970
and it's not like men are exactly happy 
about being made,

13
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,220
but made self conscious by women.
Right?

14
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:46,221
It's a major source of continual tension
between men and women and it's no 

15
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:49,701
wonder,
but it's also the case and this is 

16
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:49,701
something really cool and interesting to
know.

17
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:50,750
You know,
we do.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,670
You've divulged dive,
divulged,

19
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,200
die,
whatever.

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,320
That's it diverged.
We diverged from the common ancestor 

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,710
between us and chimpanzees about 6 
million years ago.

22
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,390
Here's why.
At least in part,

23
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,450
chimpanzee females are non discriminant 
maters.

24
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,870
They'll meet with any mail when they go 
into heat,

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,040
which human females don't.
When they go into heat,

26
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,190
then any male is allowed access.
Now the dominant males chased the 

27
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,721
subordinate males away and so the 
dominant males are more likely to leave 

28
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:26,781
offspring,
but it's not because of the female 

29
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:26,781
choice.
It's not the case with human beings.

30
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:29,210
Human females engage in hyperthermia and
hyperthermia is the,

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,460
and this is also true cross culturally 
and it's also quite.

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,870
It's just as extensive in Scandinavia,
not quite a bit of attenuation,

33
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:39,300
but not much.
Women mate across and up.

34
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:42,000
Dominance hierarchies,
manmade across and down.

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,720
Okay,
well that has to be the case because if 

36
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:47,790
obviously it has to work that way.
If one goes up,

37
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:52,791
the other has to go down.
The socioeconomic status of a woman is 

38
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:57,020
almost determined,
almost zero of her attractiveness 

39
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,011
towards a man.
Whereas the socioeconomic status of a 

40
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:03,711
man is a major determinant of his 
attractiveness towards a woman and it 

41
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:04,320
isn't as well either because that's been
tested.

42
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:09,321
It's his capacity to generate and be 
productive and to share because that 

43
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:11,850
beats the hell out of wealth.
Wealth can disappeared,

44
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:16,851
right,
but the capacity to be productive and 

45
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:16,851
share,
that's,

46
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:19,650
that's a much more important element and
why not be chosen on the basis of that,

47
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:24,651
especially because women have to have 
infants and infants make the women 

48
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:25,860
dependent and the woman is just looking 
logically,

49
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,130
rationally and from an evolutionary 
perspective for someone who is useful 

50
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,731
enough to give a hint to lend a hat so 
women make intense demands on men and 

51
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:39,861
it's no wonder,
but the thing is is that because women 

52
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:40,140
engaged in hyperglycemia,
at least in part,

53
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,410
we diverge quite rapidly from 
chimpanzees because the selection 

54
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,580
pressure that women placed on men 
developed the entire species.

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,890
Now there's two things that happened as 
far as I could tell.

56
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,440
The men competed for competence,
let's say.

57
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,040
So the male hierarchy is a mechanism 
that pushes the best man to the top 

58
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,541
virtually by definition and then that's.
That's the effect of that is multiplied 

59
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:07,291
by the fact that women who are 
forgiveness peel from the top and so 

60
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:10,501
that the males who are the most 
competent are much more likely to leave 

61
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:14,580
offspring.
And that seemed to be what drove our 

62
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:14,580
cortical expansion,
for example,

63
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,271
which happened very,
very rapidly over the course of 

64
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:18,271
evolutionary time.
