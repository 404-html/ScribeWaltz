1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,350
So I got out a textbook,
it was called race class and gender and 

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,281
it's,
it's an anthology that's used in 

3
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:12,070
cultural studies courses in women's 
studies courses and it's Sorta the goto 

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,091
texts.
So I'm told and I'm reading it and I 

5
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:19,031
turned it and I would turn to page 14 
and I can tell you it's page 14 because 

6
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:21,170
I was so astounded by what I found and 
it said,

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,910
uh,
we.

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,140
Oh,
it says objectivity as found through 

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,031
rational thought is a western and 
masculine concept that we will challenge

10
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:33,050
throughout this text.
Yeah,

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,280
right.
Yeah.

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,150
Yeah.
And I said it's too bad.

13
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:41,151
It's too bad that you're shocked by that
because the want to go for irrational pc

14
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,640
types have been saying exactly that 
since the 19 seventies.

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,950
Like,
that is exactly.

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,780
Make no mistake about it.
This is why mcclachi is wrong.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,200
This isn't,
this isn't something they're secreting 

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,200
in.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,540
This is the dead statement.
Oh yeah.

20
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,850
They said,
um,

21
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,210
the,
the whole notion of logic and coherence 

22
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,690
and empirical data for that matter,
the very nature of evidence.

23
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,110
Let's question,
let's question the definition of 

24
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,110
evidence because the underlying idea.
Remember,

25
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,290
the underlying idea here is that all 
hierarchies are predicated on power,

26
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,610
so if the reason that I put forward 
something as evidence isn't because it's

27
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,280
evidence,
it's because it's evidence that I get to

28
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,790
have that position of power,
and so if you're a postmodernist and you

29
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:24,120
say,
well,

30
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:29,121
I'm going to question your evidence,
what you think you're saying is you're 

31
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:30,540
going to question my claim to that 
arbitrary power.

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,350
The whole idea that there's evidence 
outside of claims of arbitrary power.

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,200
The postmodernist dispensed without the 
19 seventies.

34
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,320
That's Derrida.
That's exactly what he said it all.

35
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:46,321
This time I've been trying to get 
samples of thousands so that I could 

36
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:46,321
say,
this is a little bit.

37
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,960
We can say something God just in 
generalized.

38
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,350
No,
no.

39
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:54,351
That just demonstrates how thoroughly 
entrenched you are in the reining 

40
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:54,390
patriarchal ideology,
I guess,

41
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,030
and I was just hoping to get beyond 
anecdotal.

42
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,270
There's no beyond that.
There's no beyond anecdotal.

43
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:02,180
That's become a methodology.
That's audible.

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,880
It's called auto.
Ethnography is a technical term for it 

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,440
and auto ethnography is the publication 
of a journey of a,

46
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,500
of a private diary essentially in a 
hypothetically reputable,

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,160
reputable academic journal.
It it's only because of in the last 

48
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,220
three or four years that these things 
have been happening and I said,

49
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:26,700
well,
where do they get this?

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,390
How do they,
how do they find these thoughts?

51
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,080
Yes.
Well,

52
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,180
we don't.
We don't want to fall into the mistake 

53
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,601
of making,
of making the assumption that this 

54
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:41,241
hasn't been thought through.
People are not just misunderstanding 

55
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,050
what evidence is.
That isn't what's happening at all.

56
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,260
When they say they want to question the 
definition of evidence,

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,560
that's exactly what they mean when they 
say we want to question the definition 

58
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,521
of evidence because the definition of 
evidence currently supports the 

59
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:56,700
scientific power structure in chemistry 
say,

60
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,800
and that's fundamentally dominated by 
let's say white men.

61
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,040
We can go after the definition of 
evidence itself and that's how we're 

62
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,281
going to bring it down and so the next 
people on the hit list are going to be 

63
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:11,671
the biologists.
They're already under attack from the 

64
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:11,680
social justice.
It said that mathematics is whiteness,

65
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,220
you know?
Yeah,

66
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,470
yeah,
definitely.

67
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,960
I didn't know that mathematics could 
have a race.

68
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,650
Yeah,
but thing.

69
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,250
The thing is there's nothing logical 
about these claims.

70
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,940
Once you accept this central axioms,
the axioms are straightforward.

71
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,420
The world is a battle ground of power 
hierarchies.

72
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,780
That's what it is.
There isn't anything else outside of 

73
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,571
that,
and each power hierarchy generates its 

74
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:39,961
own internal narrative including rules 
for what constitutes evidence that 

75
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:46,411
support and buttress the structure of 
that hierarchy and because the 

76
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:51,421
hierarchy's exclude,
then it's in the best interests of the 

77
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:51,760
people who are excluded to invert the 
hierarchy,

78
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,880
and of course they also regard that as 
just even though that's part of the 

79
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,571
incoherence of the entire argument,
that's where they have to turn to to 

80
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:01,150
Marxism,
but make no mistake about it.

81
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,130
This isn't.
This isn't accidental.

82
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:05,500
It isn't.
People misunderstanding what constitutes

83
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:07,360
evidence.
Not at all.
