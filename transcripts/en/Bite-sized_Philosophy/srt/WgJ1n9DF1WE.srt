1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,450
And then the worst snake of all his 
malevolence,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,020
and that's I think that's technically 
correct because one of the things that 

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:09,810
you view,
for example,

4
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:12,000
when you're looking at posttraumatic 
stress disorder,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,240
is that it's almost always the case that
someone who suffers from post traumatic 

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,201
stress disorder,
which you might think of as a real real 

7
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:25,041
life re incarnation of the fall,
is that people encounter something 

8
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:29,490
malevolent and it breaks them because 
it's the worst thing to understand.

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,350
It's like suffering is one thing,
man,

10
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:32,460
that's,
that's bad enough.

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,590
Vulnerability and suffering,
that's bad enough,

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,040
but to encounter someone who wishes that
upon you and will work to bring it 

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,091
about,
that's a whole different category of 

14
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,251
horrible,
especially when it also reflect 

15
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:49,401
something back to you about yourself.
Because if someone else can do that to 

16
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:53,931
you and they're human,
that means that you partake of the same 

17
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:53,931
essence.

18
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:56,400
Strangely enough,
that's actually the cure to some degree,

19
00:00:56,401 --> 00:01:00,180
to posttraumatic stress disorder is like
if you've been victimized,

20
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:05,181
you're naive and you've been victimized.
The way out of that is to no longer be 

21
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:07,410
naive and to no longer be victimized,
and that means that you.

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,840
You see this reflected in the Harry 
Potter idea,

23
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:14,841
for example,
that the reason that Harry Potter can 

24
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,580
withstand voldemort is because he's got 
a piece of a already been touched by it 

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,150
and the way that you.
The way that you keep the psychopaths at

26
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:24,360
bay is to develop the inner psychopaths 
so that you know when,

27
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:27,630
when you see what right and then,
but that's a voluntary thing.

28
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:28,340
It's,
it's so.

29
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:31,500
It's like a.
it's like a a set of tools that you have

30
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:34,950
at your disposal which has full 
knowledge of evil and that does.

31
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,620
Nina said,
if you look into an abyss for too long,

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,230
you risk having the abyss gaze back into
you.

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,260
Right?
The idea is that if you look at 

34
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,091
something monstrous,
you have a tendency to turn into a 

35
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:48,600
monster and people are often very afraid
of looking at monsters.

36
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:51,570
Things exactly for that reason,
and then the question is,

37
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:53,100
well,
should you turn into a monster?

38
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:55,530
And the answer to that is yes,
you should,

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,310
but you should do it voluntarily and not
accidentally,

40
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,460
and you should do it with the good in 
mind rather than falling prey to it by 

41
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,300
possession essentially,
because that's the alternative.

42
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,640
And how does it possess you?
That's easy.

43
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,690
You're suffering makes you better.
Your bitterness makes you resentful,

44
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,290
you're resentful,
mate means meat,

45
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,090
makes you vengeful.
And once you're on that road,

46
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:19,890
you go down that a little bit farther,
man,

47
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,450
while you end up fantasizing in your 
basement about shooting up the local 

48
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:26,970
high school and then killing yourself,
right?

49
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:30,630
Because that's sort of the ultimate end 
of that line of pathological reasoning.

50
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,110
Beings should be eradicated because of 
its intrinsic evil.

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,250
And I'm exactly the person to do it and 
I'll cap it off with an indication of my

52
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,890
own lack of worth just to hammer the 
point home.

53
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,370
Right?
And if I can garner a little post post 

54
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,110
post you miss fame along the way,
well that'll satisfy my primordial 

55
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,020
primate dominance hierarchy,
a imaginings to at least in fantasy.

56
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,290
So you know,
it's the full package if you want to go 

57
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:57,290
down that route.
And of course people don't like to think

58
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,830
about that sort of thing and it's no 
bloody wonder,

59
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,230
but without the capability for mayhem,
Europe,

60
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:02,890
you're,
you're,

61
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,180
you're a potential victim to mayhem,
so you need your sword.

62
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,330
It should be sheath,
but you need to have it and it's very 

63
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,271
frequently the case.
If you treat someone with posttraumatic 

64
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:15,271
stress disorder,
the.

65
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:15,820
There's two things you have to do.

66
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,270
You have to help them develop a very 
articulated philosophy of evil because 

67
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,070
otherwise their brain bothers him over 
and over and over.

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,770
Why?
Why were you so deal with naive?

69
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,620
How did you become victimized?
Why were you such as soccer?

70
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,130
These are good questions.
You don't want to have that happen to 

71
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,130
you again.
You don't want to be exploited twice.

72
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,340
Okay?
So your eyes have to open up.

73
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,010
We know the price of that from the 
Egyptian myth,

74
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,260
right?
You come into contact with Seth,

75
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,240
what happens?
Even if you're a god,

76
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,110
you lose it.
I,

77
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,640
it's no joke,
man.

78
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,030
It's no joke.
And then the cure for that is the 

79
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,610
movement down into the underworld and 
the revitalization of the father.

80
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,330
That's the identification with the 
forest that created culture,

81
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,360
right,
and that then there's you and that 

82
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,360
together.
Then you can withstand malevolence.

83
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,310
Maybe you can withstand tragedy and 
malevolence and then that's the whole 

84
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:05,310
secret,
right?

85
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,440
Because that's what you want in life.
You need to be able to withstand tragedy

86
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,850
and you need to be able to withstand 
malevolence because those are the forces

87
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,140
that are always working against you,
and so it's.

88
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,250
This is associated with the union idea 
of incorporation of the shadow,

89
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,660
right?
You have to be.

90
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,080
We know this God,
we know how predators work with regards 

91
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,730
to children.
Even if you're a pedophilic Predator and

92
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:31,030
you're looking at a landscape of 
children,

93
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,390
the child that you're going to go after 
is the one that's timid and won't fight 

94
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,351
back.
You've picked your victim and predatory 

95
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:42,340
people in general are exactly like that 
man there because they're predators.

96
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,730
They're not going to attack someone 
who's who's going to fight back.

97
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,210
In fact,
the issue is likely not to even come up.

98
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,600
They're going to be looking for someone 
one way or another that cannot 

99
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,310
conceptualize what they are and then 
perfect.

100
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,770
It's,
it's open season and it's open season,

101
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,980
and so if you're treating someone with 
posttraumatic stress disorder,

102
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,540
first they need an introduction to the 
philosophy of malevolence and second,

103
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,930
they have to learn to become dangerous 
because that's the only way out.

104
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,180
What's the alternative?
They get these recurrent thoughts about 

105
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,551
their vulnerability in the face of 
malevolence and their own naive nutty 

106
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:24,600
because by definition,
if someone psychopathic has exploited 

107
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:24,940
you,
you're too naive.

108
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,950
It's.
It's a definitional issue.

109
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,820
You can say,
well,

110
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:30,340
that's no fault of mine.
How the hell could I be prepared?

111
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,630
Fair enough,
man.

112
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,430
Perfectly reasonable objection doesn't 
solve your problem because it's an.

113
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,750
It's an eternal problem.
