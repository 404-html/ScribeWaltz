1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,080
It's really fun to look at these old 
pictures once you kind of know what they

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:04,950
mean.
You know,

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,290
the delayed.
At least that's what I've discovered is 

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,080
that once I kind of understand the 
underlying rationale for.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,490
I mean someone worked hard on that.
That's an engraving,

6
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:19,491
right?
They took a long time making that 

7
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:19,770
picture there are serious about it.
And when you understand what it means,

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,060
you know,
all those people there,

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,370
their prostate,
prostrate at the,

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,140
um,
at the,

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,300
at the revelation of the law.
It's like,

12
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:34,301
well,
no wonder it's like breaks the law and 

13
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,251
see what happens.
Break the universal moral law man and 

14
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:36,251
see what happens.
You know,

15
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:38,510
I see people in that situation will,
as you all do all the time,

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,480
perhaps me more than you because I'm a 
clinical psychologist,

17
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:46,481
you know,
and if the people I'm seeing having 

18
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:48,800
broken the universal law than you can 
bloody well be sure that people around 

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,520
them have.
It's no joke,

20
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,510
like you make a mistake and things will 
go seriously wrong for you.

21
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,570
And so it's no wonder that you'd be

22
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,220
terrified at the revelation of the 
structure that governs our big.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,920
One of the things that's so remarkable 
about the old testament,

24
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,720
this is another thing,
nature commented door.

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,760
He was a real admirer of the Old 
Testament,

26
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:12,910
not so much of the New Testament.
He thought it was a sin for Europe to 

27
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,350
have glued the new testament onto the 
old testament because he thought the old

28
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:20,351
testament was a really accurate 
representation of the phenomenology of 

29
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:22,760
Ba.
It's like stay awake,

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,820
speak property,
be honest or watch the hell out because 

31
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,410
things will come your way that you just 
do not want to see at all.

32
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,530
And it might not just be you,
it might be everyone you know and 

33
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,260
everything about your culture that is 
demolished for,

34
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:41,090
for generation after generation.
It's like stay awake and be careful.

35
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,210
And I like.
I think that people only don't believe 

36
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,120
that when they're being hubris stick.

37
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,910
And I think that most people know that 
deep in their hearts,

38
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:51,860
you know,
when you get high on your horse,

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,170
that happens fairly often.
If you have any sense,

40
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:54,680
you think,
Geez,

41
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:59,681
I better be careful and tap myself down 
a fair bit because if I get too puffed 

42
00:01:59,681 --> 00:01:59,681
up,
man,

43
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:04,330
something's going to come along and take
me out at the knees and everyone knows 

44
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,080
that pride comes before a fall.
It's like if you have any.

45
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:11,081
That's why it says in the Old Testament 
that fear of God is the beginning of 

46
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:13,931
wisdom.
It's like I've never in all my years as 

47
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:15,380
a clinical psychologist and this is 
something that really does terrify me.

48
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,590
I as I have never seen anyone ever get 
away with anything at all.

49
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,930
Even once you know,
there's that old idea that God has a 

50
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:25,930
book,
you know,

51
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:26,660
and it keeps track of everything in 
heaven.

52
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,560
It's like,
okay,

53
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:28,310
okay.
You know,

54
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,950
maybe it's not a book,
fine,

55
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,580
but that is a really useful thing to 
think about because while I'd maybe you 

56
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,751
disagree,
maybe you think people get away with 

57
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:40,751
things all the time.
I tell you,

58
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:43,901
I've never seen it.
What I see instead is that thing 

59
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:43,901
happens,
right?

60
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:46,070
They,
someone twists the fabric of reality and

61
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:51,071
they do it successfully because it 
doesn't snap back at them that moment 

62
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,780
and then like two years later something 
unraveled and they get walloped and they

63
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:54,500
think,
oh my God,

64
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:56,720
that's so unfair.
And then we track it.

65
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,790
It's like,
well,

66
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,560
what happened before that?
This?

67
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,120
Well then what?
This,

68
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,550
and then what this,
and then what?

69
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,310
Oh,
oh,

70
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,440
this,
oh,

71
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:08,320
that's where it went wrong.
It's,

72
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:13,321
yeah,
because you can't twist the fabric of 

73
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,220
reality without having it snapped back.
It doesn't work that way.

74
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,410
And why would it?
Because what are you going to do?

75
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,870
Twists the fabric of reality?
I don't think so.

76
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,090
I think it's bigger than you,
you know,

77
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:25,450
and I think that one of the things that 
really tempts people is the idea that,

78
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,740
well,
I can get away with it.

79
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,760
It's like,
yeah,

80
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,800
you try,
you see how well that works.

81
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,540
So like,
you,

82
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,570
you get away with nothing and that is 
the beginning of wisdom and it's 

83
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,740
something that deeply terrifies me.
And you know,

84
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,870
ever since last September when I came to
a broader public attention,

85
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:46,951
one of the things I'd be terrified of 
making a mistake because I certainly 

86
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:48,640
know I'm more than capable of making a 
mistake and thank God so far,

87
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:51,370
either I haven't made one or no one's 
found out about it.

88
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,950
So,
but it's like,

89
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,100
you know,
we walk on a very thin and narrow edge 

90
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,520
and we're very lucky when things aren't 
degenerating into chaos around this or 

91
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,540
rapidly moving too far,
too much order and it's not an easy 

92
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,980
thing to stay on that line.
And you can tell when you stay,

93
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,060
you're on that line because the things 
are deeply meaningful and engaging when 

94
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,741
you're on that line.
But if you're not existentially 

95
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:17,860
terrified about the consequences of 
wavering off that,

96
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:20,860
then you are truly not awake.
So.

97
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,930
And that's what I see in this picture,
you know,

98
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:27,931
it's like look out man,
because there are rules and if you break

99
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,920
them,
God help you.

100
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:38,290
Thank you.
