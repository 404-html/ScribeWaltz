1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,110
The internal problem is how do you deal 
with tragedy and malevolence and you can

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:04,440
say,
well,

3
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:05,640
I'm not prepared.
It's like,

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,470
yeah,
fair enough.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,650
Unsurprising.
Especially if you were over protected as

6
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:13,290
a child.
It's not a good idea to overprotect your

7
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:18,291
kids because the snakes are going to 
come into the garden no matter what you 

8
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:22,101
do,
and so then you instead of trying to 

9
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:23,250
keep the damn snakes away,
what you do is you are a mere child with

10
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:28,251
something that can help them chop them 
into pieces and make the world out of 

11
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:31,641
them so that the trick for human 
thriving in the face of suffering and 

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,230
malevolence is strength,
not protection.

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,920
It's a completely different idea.
We also know this clinically.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,040
We know for example,
that if you treat people with exposure 

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,520
therapy for agora phobia,
which is roughly speaking,

16
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,980
the fear of chaos,
I would say the fear of everything.

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,250
You don't make them less afraid.
You make them braver.

18
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,400
It's not the same thing because with an 
agoraphobic,

19
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:58,401
see what happens to them is the fault.
They never conceptualized death and 

20
00:00:58,401 --> 00:00:59,880
suffering.
They're naive,

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,670
right?
It.

22
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,730
It never enters their.
The theater of their imagination and 

23
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,030
it's because they're protected from it,
but then something happens.

24
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:08,550
This often happens to women in their 
forties because they're.

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,400
They're the people most likely to 
develop agoraphobic.

26
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,210
Something happens there.
They've been protected from chaos by 

27
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,601
authority their entire life,
so maybe they had an overprotective 

28
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:23,900
father and then they went to an 
overprotective boyfriend and then they 

29
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,980
went to an over protective husband and 
maybe they were willing to be subjugated

30
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:28,560
to all three of those because of the 
project protection.

31
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,110
Right,
so so that's the bargain.

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,190
They stay weak and dependent and maybe 
they have to because that's the only way

33
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:37,890
they can appeal to the person who's 
hyper protective,

34
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:42,891
but the price they pay for that is that 
they're not sufficiently competent and 

35
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:43,020
then something happens in their life.

36
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,510
Often in their forties,
they develop heart palpitations maybe as

37
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:51,511
a consequence of menopause.
Their heart starts to beat a radically 

38
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,020
and they think,
oh no,

39
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:53,070
death.
It's like,

40
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,600
well,
who are you going to talk to about that?

41
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,720
Right.
There's no protection from authority for

42
00:01:57,721 --> 00:02:02,721
that.
Or maybe their friend gets divorced or 

43
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:02,721
maybe their sister dies or something 
like that.

44
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:06,390
It brings up the specter of mortality 
and maybe the specter of malevolence and

45
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:11,391
mortality and it brings it up in a way 
that authority recourse to authority 

46
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:13,980
cannot solve,
and so then they have panic attacks.

47
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:15,000
What happens?
They go out,

48
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,680
they get afraid,
they feel their heart beating.

49
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,900
Then they get afraid of their heart 
beating because they think,

50
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,160
oh no,
I'm going to die.

51
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,750
And they think,
oh no,

52
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:26,751
I'm going to die and I'm going to make a
fool of myself while I'm doing it and 

53
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:26,751
attract a lot of attention.

54
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:30,570
So the two big fears come up,
mortality and social judgment,

55
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,880
and then they have a panic attack.
It's like fight or flights going out of 

56
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:35,880
control.
Very,

57
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,891
very unpleasant.
Then they start to avoid the places 

58
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:42,681
they've had a panic attack.
Then they ended up not being able to go 

59
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:42,720
anywhere.
So then tie A.

60
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,240
Matt has come back,
write a huge monster,

61
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,790
a little victim.
And so what do you do with them?

62
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,370
Well,
there's no saying no.

63
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,940
There's no tire map that's done right 
there.

64
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,610
Naivety is over.
They,

65
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,830
they've had a direct contact with the 
threat of mortality and social judgment.

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,040
They've met the terrible mother and 
they've met the terrible father and 

67
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,740
there's no going back.
There's no saying,

68
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,180
oh,
the world is safe.

69
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,100
It's not safe.
Not at all.

70
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,790
It's not safe.
The fact that you think it's safe means 

71
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,941
that you were living in an unconscious 
bubble that was sort of provided to you 

72
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:17,950
by your culture.

73
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,780
It's a gift and now that's been 
shattered and so now what do you do?

74
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,380
Well,
the answer is you retreat until you're 

75
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:28,380
in your house and there's nowhere you 
can go.

76
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,110
You're the ultimate frozen rabbit,
right?

77
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,660
And your life is hell because you can't 
function.

78
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,980
The alternative is let's take apart the 
things you're afraid of.

79
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,870
Let's expose you to them carefully and 
programmatically,

80
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,850
and then you'll learn that you can.
You're actually tougher than you think.

81
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,330
You never knew that and maybe you didn't
want to take on the responsibility 

82
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,140
because you know people play a role in 
their own demise,

83
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:58,141
so to speak.
When you had an opportunity to go out 

84
00:03:58,141 --> 00:03:58,900
and explore or withdraw because you were
afraid,

85
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,150
you chose to withdraw because you were 
afraid,

86
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,400
so it's not only that you were over 
protected,

87
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:08,401
often it's that you were willing to take
advantage of the fact that you are 

88
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:10,690
overprotected and run back there 
whenever you had the opportunity,

89
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,240
you know,
so maybe you're a kid in the playground,

90
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:13,420
right?

91
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,880
And you're having some trouble with 
other kids and you know,

92
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:20,881
in the back of your mind,
I should deal with deal with this 

93
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:20,881
myself,
but you go and tell your mom and get her

94
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:23,290
to intervene and you know that that's 
not right.

95
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,360
You know that you're breaking the social
contract,

96
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,850
but it's easier.
And so that's what you do.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,720
You run off to an authority figure and 
hide behind the great father,

98
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,160
right?
Roughly speaking,

99
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,070
while the problem with that is you don't
learn how to do it yourself.

100
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,950
So then you have to relearn it painfully
when you're 40.

101
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,250
So then you take people out,
you say,

102
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:43,840
well,
what are you afraid of?

103
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Rank it from one to 10.
So 10 is we'll make a list of 10 things 

104
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,070
you're afraid of the least,
the thing that we're least afraid of.

105
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,680
We'll call number 10.
So we'll start with that.

106
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,490
Okay,
well,

107
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:55,870
I'm afraid of elevators.
Okay,

108
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:58,030
well let's.
Let's look at a picture of an elevator.

109
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,300
Let's have you imagine being in an 
elevator.

110
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,330
Let's go out to an elevator and let you 
watch the terrible jaws of death open 

111
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,410
because that's how you're responding to 
it symbolically,

112
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,210
right?
And you're going to do that.

113
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:14,740
Add it at the.
The closest proximity you can manage.

114
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,420
You find out,
you go do that.

115
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,430
It works.
You're nervous as hell,

116
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:21,280
especially from an anticipatory 
perspective,

117
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,960
shaking.
You go out,

118
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,490
you stop,
you watch it happen,

119
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,970
and he actually calmed down.
You do that 10 times and it no longer 

120
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:29,970
bothers you.
Well,

121
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,260
what you've learned that you didn't die,
but more importantly than that,

122
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,100
you've learned that you could withstand 
the threat of death.

123
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,220
That's what you've learned,
and then you move a little closer and 

124
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,981
then you move a little closer and then 
you move a little closer and finally 

125
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:43,981
you're back in.

126
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:45,550
What's no longer the elevator from a 
symbolic perspective?

127
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,540
It's a tomb,
right?

128
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,200
It's,
it's,

129
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,250
it's a place of enclosure and isolation 
and you learn.

130
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,920
It turns out I can withstand that and 
then you're much more together,

131
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,990
much more confident,
and that's often one of the things that 

132
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,080
often happens in situations like that.
I've seen this multiple times,

133
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:08,081
is that if you run someone through an 
exposure training process like that and 

134
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,780
toughen them up,
they'll often start standing up to 

135
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,571
people around them in a way they never 
did before because they wouldn't stand 

136
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:19,451
up for themselves before because they 
weren't willing to undermine that 

137
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:20,720
protection.
See,

138
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:25,721
if you're protecting me,
I can't bother you because I can't 

139
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:29,990
afford to forsake your protection,
so if I'm going to play that game,

140
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:33,170
I'm going to be high hide behind you,
then I can't challenge you,

141
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,070
so that's no good because that's 
sometimes white people.

142
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,100
You see this with guys very frequently.
They're still deathly afraid of their 

143
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,610
fathers judgment when they're in their 
thirties or forties.

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,510
It's like,
well,

145
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:45,350
why?
Well,

146
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,280
because they still want to believe that 
there's someone out there that knows and

147
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:54,281
so they're willing to accept the 
subjugation because it doesn't force 

148
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:57,701
them to challenge the idea that there's 
someone out there that knows because 

149
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:58,250
that's the advantage of having your 
father as a judge,

150
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,230
right?
Because he knows,

151
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,610
well,
what if he doesn't?

152
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,100
What if no one knows any better than 
you?

153
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,630
Well,
that's a rough thing.

154
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,210
You don't until you realize that you're 
not an adult.

155
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Right?
That's really technically the point of 

156
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,031
realization of adulthood is that no one 
actually knows what you should do more 

157
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:16,430
than you do.
I mean,

158
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:18,920
it's a horrible realization because what
the hell do you know?

159
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,580
It's a terrible realization and people 
will often pick slavery,

160
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,210
permanent slavery to the spirit of the 
great father,

161
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:29,330
let's say over that realization,
and it's completely understandable,

162
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,360
but the problem with it is,
is that there's more to you than you 

163
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,211
think,
and so if you continue to hide behind 

164
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:39,881
that figure,
then you never have a chance to 

165
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:40,880
understand that there's more to you than
you think far more than you think.

166
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,060
Maybe there's enough to you so that you 
can actually withstand the threat of 

167
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,520
mortality without collapsing.
Maybe even withstand the threat of 

168
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,700
malevolence without collapsing.
Who knows?

169
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,930
It's certainly possible and it's not an 
abstract question.

170
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,960
It's exactly the sort of question that 
you address in the psychotherapeutic 

171
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,551
process.
It's always the question that you 

172
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:08,861
address and the answer is often in the 
affirmative because people can get 

173
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:13,241
unbelievably tough and you know that 
because people work in emergency wards 

174
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:13,460
in hospitals,
right?

175
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:16,940
Or they work in,
in palliative care wards or they work as

176
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:21,941
mortuary assistance.
I mean these people have bloody rough 

177
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:21,941
jobs,
you know,

178
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:23,990
are there on the front line of police 
investigation into,

179
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,080
you know,
highness child abuse crimes and so 

180
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,990
they're confronting malevolence on a 
regular basis and you know,

181
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:34,991
those are very stressful jobs,
but people do them and some people do 

182
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:40,091
them without even being damaged by them.
Although that's a harder thing because 

183
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:40,970
you can see horrible things,
you know,

184
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,230
things you will never forget.
