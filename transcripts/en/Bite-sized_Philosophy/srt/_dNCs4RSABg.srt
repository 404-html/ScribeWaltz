1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,170
Now I'm going to read you some things 
from Friedman who wrote the 

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:05,170
disappearance of God.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,950
He was trying to look at the underlying 
structure of the stories.

4
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:12,850
Now,
Friedman noted that the books in the Old

5
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:17,050
Testament were written by a lot of 
different people at very different times

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:22,330
and then they were sequenced by other 
people for reasons that we don't exactly

7
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:27,331
understand,
but there's still an underlying 

8
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:31,351
narrative.
There's multiple underlying narrative 

9
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:32,740
unity's despite the fact of that rather 
arbitrary sequencing,

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,230
and that's a strange thing.
You know,

11
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:38,920
I guess you could say if you had a 
collection of ancient books and you were

12
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:41,620
trying to put them together,
you try to put them together in some way

13
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:43,750
that made sense.
Right,

14
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:48,751
and it wouldn't make sense unless you 
stumbled across some kind of underlying 

15
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:49,300
narrative that allowed you to order 
them,

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,960
and so it's not entirely surprising that
that they're ordered in a manner that's 

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,980
comprehensible.
But Friedman's comments on the 

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,950
underlying narrative structure,
part of it was,

19
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,870
well,
we'll go through this.

20
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:08,050
The books of the Old Testament were 
composed by a great many authors 

21
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:08,930
according to both traditional religious 
views and modern critical scholarship,

22
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,380
the phenomenon of the diminishing 
apparent presence of God across so many 

23
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,951
stories through so many books by so many
authors spread over so many centuries is

24
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:21,860
consistent enough to be striking,
impressive and ultimately mysterious,

25
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,690
but the hiding of the divine phase is 
only half the story.

26
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:31,691
There's another development also 
extending across the course of the 

27
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,811
entire narrative of the Hebrew Bible,
which we must see before we can 

28
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:38,291
appreciate the full force of this 
phenomena and before we can pose the 

29
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,200
solution to the mystery of this,
of how this happened.

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,440
Gradually from genesis to Ezra and see 
that there is a transition from divine 

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,250
to human responsibility for life on 
earth.

32
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,290
The story begins in genesis with God in 
complete control of the creation,

33
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,470
but by the end,
humans have arrived at a stage at which 

34
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,260
in all apparent ways,
they have responsibility for the fate of

35
00:01:57,261 --> 00:02:00,110
the world.
The first two human beings,

36
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,800
Adam and eve,
take little responsibility themselves.

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,490
They do not design or build anything 
when they're embarrassed over their 

38
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:10,490
nudity.
They do not make clothes.

39
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,650
They cover themselves with leaves.
It's God who makes their first clothing 

40
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:15,650
for them.

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,400
No.
I'm by no means a fully developed 

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,400
personality.
No,

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,280
it is not an every man either.
Broadly speaking,

44
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:25,970
he reflects a step beyond Adam and eve 
and human character and responsibility.

45
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,170
Abraham,
beyond that counts of divine commands 

46
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,100
that Abraham does carry out.
The narrative also includes a variety of

47
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:36,890
stories in which Abraham acts on his own
initiative.

48
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,890
He divides land with his nephew lot.
He battles kings.

49
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:42,740
He takes concubines.
He argued with his wife Sarah.

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,940
On two occasions,
he tells kings that Sarah,

51
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,580
his sister,
out of fear,

52
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:50,240
that they will kill him to get his wife,
and he arranges his son's marriage.

53
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,910
In the place of the single story of 
Noah's drunkenness,

54
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:54,470
there are,
in the case of Abraham,

55
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:58,370
the stories of man's life,
the Abraham section that's developed the

56
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:02,650
personality and of a man of man to a new
degree in biblical narrative,

57
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,930
while picturing in him a new degree of 
responsibility.

58
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,780
It is not just that Abraham has kindler 
kinder,

59
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,010
gentler,
more intrepid,

60
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:14,011
more ethical,
or a better debater than his ancestor 

61
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:14,920
noah.
Rather both the Noah and Abraham stories

62
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:19,921
or pieces of a development of an 
increasingly stronger stance of humans 

63
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:20,980
relative to the day before the story is 
over.

64
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,280
Humans will become a great deal,
stronger and bolder than Abraham.

65
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,040
I don't know what that means,
you know?

66
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,870
See,
it isn't.

67
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,180
It is certainly the case that the 
individual exists in the modern world,

68
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,510
the differentiated self aware,
self conscious individual,

69
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,660
and it's certainly the case that that 
wasn't the case at some point in the 

70
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,260
past and so it's the case that there's 
been a development,

71
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,330
I don't know if you could call it a 
progression,

72
00:03:57,331 --> 00:04:02,331
but a development of the autonomous 
individual over some span of historical 

73
00:04:02,521 --> 00:04:04,590
time.
Now we don't know how long that's been,

74
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:07,440
but my suspicions are,
it hasn't been that long.

75
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,060
I mean,

76
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,970
I read once about a Neolithic ceremony 
that involve the particular placement of

77
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:22,821
a bear skull in a cave,
and then I read that and they had found 

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,570
these placements in caves that were at 
least 25,000

79
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:32,571
years old and then I read that they 
found caves in Japan among the Ainu who 

80
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:36,771
were the indigenous inhabitants of 
Japanese territory and rather archaic 

81
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:41,181
people who had the same ceremony with 
the bear and that put the skull in the 

82
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:45,831
same orientation and place in caves and 
that that tradition remained unbroken 

83
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:47,970
for about 25,000
years.

84
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,070
And you think,
well,

85
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,110
is it possible for an oral or ritual 
tradition to remain on broken for spans 

86
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,850
of tens of thousands of years?
And the answer to that is not only is it

87
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:59,970
possible,
it's actually the norm because like

88
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,470
one chimpanzee is like the next 
chimpanzee,

89
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,120
right?
In the progression,

90
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:10,121
in the biological progression.
If you took a chimpanzee troop now and 

91
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:13,781
you went back 25,000
years and you looked at a chimpanzee 

92
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:13,781
troop,
it'd be the same thing.

93
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:17,621
There's no historical progression.
That's how you can tell the chimps 

94
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,700
really don't have culture because if 
they could even create one,

95
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:24,230
1000th of a percent of culture,
transmissible culture progeneration,

96
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,350
it wouldn't take more than about a 
million years before they'd have a whole

97
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:31,790
civilization and they don't.
They're the same as they were and so the

98
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:36,791
continuity,
the stability and unchanging nature of 

99
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,271
his species,
essentially speaking is the rule that 

100
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:44,800
the variant is us.
It's like what the hell happened after 

101
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,430
the last ice age?
Fifteen thousand years ago,

102
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,760
we went from tribal uniform stable to 
whatever the hell we are now.

103
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,710
It's this transition from

104
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,030
generic too.
It's something like that and I can't 

105
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,821
help but think that that's reflected in 
this text and it has something to do 

106
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,240
with this transition of consciousness 
from,

107
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,490
from what?
From possession by the generic divine to

108
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,820
dominance by this specific individual.
It's something like that.

109
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:18,620
Is that a neurological transformation?
Is that what this is a record of been?

110
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,980
We don't know.
One of the things you said about God 

111
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,561
because human relationship with God as 
an object of belief is very complex.

112
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,570
He in his technical writing,
he always talks about the image of God.

113
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:35,060
He never talks about God.
He talks about the image of God.

114
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,120
He said that the image of God dwells 
within us,

115
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,160
not the same thing as God dwelling 
within.

116
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,220
Right?
Because we could mean all of these 

117
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,580
capacities that we have for transcendent
consciousness could be a byproduct of 

118
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,640
biological evolution that could have no 
reflection.

119
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:54,641
They can have no relationship whatsoever
to an actual transcendent reality.

120
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:59,801
There's no way of telling the 
transcendent reality seems to manifest 

121
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:03,371
itself as an element of experience,
but that doesn't mean that it has in 

122
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:06,041
reality outside of this objective,
even if it's even if it exists as it 

123
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,270
clearly does,
but

124
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,900
Friedman suggests that what's happening 
in the biblical narrative is the 

125
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,921
sequential emergence of the individual 
as a redemptive force and that the old 

126
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:34,151
testament documents that implicitly,
unconsciously as a consequence of 

127
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,210
descriptive fantasy and that that's 
what's going on in the book and that so 

128
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,400
the Cosmos is under the control of 
generic daddy to begin with.

129
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:51,401
Something like that.
And then that controls shifts to 

130
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:56,140
localized,
identifiable increasingly personal and 

131
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,251
detailed individuals.
And you see that in Noah and then you 

132
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:01,650
see the neighborhood and then you see it
in Moses,

133
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,340
and then there's this working out of 
what it would mean to be a fully 

134
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,760
developed individual.
And that's what these stories,

135
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:10,410
they're there,
they're there,

136
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,580
they're like prototypes there.
There are attempts to to to bring about 

137
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,121
the proper motive being right and so 
Abraham is a is a manifestation of that 

138
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:21,270
because he enters into a covenant with 
God.

139
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:23,880
He's selected by God or interesting to a
partnership with God.

140
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:28,881
It's not exactly obvious.
God provides him with forward motion and

141
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:34,701
intuition and leads them towards a 
successful mode of being.

142
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:36,840
And it's complex,
successful motive being.

143
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:39,840
Because Abraham is a very complex life.
There's plenty of ups and downs,

144
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:40,260
right?
It's,

145
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,570
it's not unbroken

146
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,660
security of being towards the divine 
hand.

147
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:51,661
Abraham lies and cheats and deceives and
does all sorts of things that that a 

148
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:54,430
real person would do.
And and Moses for example,

149
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:59,431
killed.
And so these people that the biblical 

150
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:02,340
people are very genuine individuals,
but they're given with all their faults,

151
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,480
right,
with all their sins,

152
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:08,481
with all their deceit,
they're still put forth as potential 

153
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,460
modes of proper models of potential 
proper being in the world.

154
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,640
And the entire Corpus of the Bible seems
to be nothing but an attempt to keep 

155
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,591
throwing up variance of the personality.
Trying to experiment to find out what 

156
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,470
personality works in the world.
