1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,240
And with regards with regards to the 
universities,

2
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:09,241
I thought at one point that the best 
thing to do would be to cut their 

3
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:11,761
funding by 25 percent,
let them fight amongst themselves for 

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,791
the remnants because it would force the 
universities to decide exactly what's 

5
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:18,391
important and what isn't.
So I would say the humanities and much 

6
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:21,541
of the social sciences have has turned 
into a postmodern Neil Marxist 

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,260
playground for radicals.
The scholarship is terrible.

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,380
Eighty percent of humanities papers 
aren't cited once,

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,860
once.
And so what that means is that they 

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,141
write papers for each other and they 
sell them to libraries and that's how 

11
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:34,330
the publishers make their money and no 
one reads them.

12
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:39,331
But the publishers can print them 
because the libraries have to buy them 

13
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:39,331
and they're buying them with your tax 
money.

14
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:44,280
And so all of you who are sitting here 
are funding and postmodern radical neo 

15
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,711
Marxist agenda that has its roots in the
university and your tax money is going 

16
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:50,620
towards that.
And if you want proof of that,

17
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:53,140
you just go online and look at the 
websites,

18
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:55,660
especially of of disciplines like 
women's studies,

19
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:57,520
which has pathological right to the 
core,

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,730
but it's not just women's studies,
it's all the ethnic studies group

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,580
you.

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,300
It's anthropology,
it's sociology,

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,330
it's social work,
and most of all it's education and 

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:11,330
noisy.
For example,

25
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,490
in Ontario is perhaps a part from the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission,

26
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,500
the most dangerous institution in 
Canada.

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,200
Thank you.
It should

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,570
be defunded.
It's as simple as that.

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,670
They don't do the research they purport 
to do.

30
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:28,760
They're not interested in it at all.
In education.

31
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:33,110
They're interested in the indoctrination
of people as young as they can fund a as

32
00:01:33,111 --> 00:01:35,720
young as they can get their hands on,
so to speak.

33
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:41,050
Now we need to figure out,
our society needs to figure out how to 

34
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,760
stop shunting public tax money to 
radical left wing activists.

35
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:46,040
If we were doing that for radical right 
wing activists,

36
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:51,041
there would be an absolute storm,
but it's happened incrementally since 

37
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:51,680
the 19 sixties and it needs to stop.
