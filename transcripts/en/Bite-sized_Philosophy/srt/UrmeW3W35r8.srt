1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:06,910
Here's an interesting thing,
so one of the postmodernists claims is 

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,710
that diversity is necessary and they 
make it racial and they make it sexual.

3
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:13,970
They may get ethnic and all of that.
That's actually technically incorrect by

4
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:14,630
the way,
because

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,540
I study individual differences,
so those are the differences between 

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,991
people and I know the literature.
So you know about James Damore memo 

7
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:30,421
right from Google.
He wrote that partly because he was 

8
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:32,611
watching my videos,
which is why he wanted me to interview 

9
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:35,131
him and I'm a believer that there are 
biological differences in temperament 

10
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:40,081
between men and women apart from the 
other obvious differences and that 

11
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,621
they're actually not trivial and that 
they maximizing in the societies that 

12
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:47,770
have the most have moved farthest to 
producing egalitarian states,

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,470
the Scandinavian countries,
and that.

14
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:55,471
The reason for that is that there's two 
reasons why men and women different 

15
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:58,381
temperament.
One is biological and the other is 

16
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:00,781
environmental,
and if you remove the environmental 

17
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:00,781
variation,
which you do,

18
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:04,831
if you make the state egalitarian,
you maximize the genetic variation and 

19
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:09,750
that's been demonstrated in the 
scientific literature over about four 

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,261
decades and no one wanted it or hope for
it and they weren't biased and looking 

21
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:17,821
for it because that was exactly the 
opposite of what social scientists 

22
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:20,731
wanted to find because social scientists
lean heavily to the left and what they 

23
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:24,571
wanted to find was you flatten out the 
state so that everyone has equal 

24
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:26,080
opportunity and the differences between 
people disappear.

25
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:31,230
That is not what happened.
The opposite happened that wasn't wrong 

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,970
and no one was happy about it and no 
one's happy about it.

27
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:38,971
Now you can actually tell when you've 
discovered something in the social 

28
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:39,790
science because you're not happy about 
it,

29
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,540
but

30
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,180
if you take.
Let's say there's a big difference 

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,180
between men and women in terms of trait,
agreeableness,

32
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,950
compassion and politeness.
On average,

33
00:01:56,951 --> 00:02:01,270
women are more agreeable than men and 
the difference is approximately this.

34
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:04,510
If you take random pairs of men and 
women out of the population,

35
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,180
let's say you had to make a bet on who 
was more agreeable,

36
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,540
if you bet that it was the woman,
you'd be right 60 percent of the time,

37
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,200
well that's not that much means you'd be
wrong.

38
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,410
Forty percent of the time,
that's almost 50 percent of the time,

39
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,680
so this is a big difference by social 
science standards,

40
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,500
but that's the magnitude of the 
difference.

41
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:25,120
There are some differences that are 
bigger,

42
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:28,570
like the difference between men and 
women's interest in people versus things

43
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:31,030
is actually bigger than that.
That's the biggest difference we know,

44
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,150
but it's a big difference.
Let's say the agreeable this difference,

45
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:39,151
but still they the shared attributes of 
men and women far outweigh the 

46
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,010
attributes that differentiate them 
because you could ask are there more 

47
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,760
differences within groups or between 
them?

48
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,390
Now the postmodern answered that is 
between them.

49
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,290
That's why you need diversity by group,
right?

50
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:01,350
That's why you need different races.
That's why you need different 

51
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,350
ethnicities,
sexual preferences and all of that.

52
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,250
Well,
that's wrong.

53
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,170
There's more differences within the 
groups and there is between them.

54
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:10,380
You don't get diversity by crossing the 
groups.

55
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:13,860
You get diversity by group,
by selecting across individuals.

56
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:19,130
In fact,
the idea that there is more differences 

57
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,771
between groups said there is between 
individuals is actually the fundamental 

58
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:23,970
racist idea is the fundamental racist 
idea,

59
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:24,780
which is,
well,

60
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:29,781
let's say you're Asian Oriental to use 
the old word to discriminate the one 

61
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:36,670
type of Asian say from the other.
You're so different from me that there's

62
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,690
no overlap between our groups and you're
also so different and there's so little 

63
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,570
difference within your group that now 
that I know that you're not me,

64
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:48,000
you're not one of mine.
I actually know what you're like,

65
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,170
no,
technically that's incorrect.

66
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,810
That's wrong.
That isn't how you get diversity.

67
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,740
Now diversity is actually necessary 
because people,

68
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:06,741
different intelligence and they 
different temperament and the different 

69
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:09,321
skills and so you actually need 
diversity because otherwise you can't 

70
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:12,440
take advantage of all those differences.
So you need diversity,

71
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,680
but you need genuine diversity and like 
what would genuine diversity mean?

72
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,580
If you're trying to put together a work 
team,

73
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:24,581
you want enough,
you want people have sufficient 

74
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:26,981
diversity so that they more or less so 
that you gathered together the 

75
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:32,711
appropriate talents to produce the 
implement that's necessary to work 

76
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:36,161
properly in the world.
That's a competence marker because 

77
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:39,230
otherwise your business is going to fail
and so the proper diversity with regards

78
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:41,150
to employment is the diversity that

79
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,750
meets the requirements of the business 
essentially.

80
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,660
Obviously that's why you try to hire 
people carefully and not randomly.

81
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:52,870
Let's say.
