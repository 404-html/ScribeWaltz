1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,010
Joanna says,
some researchers see shame as something 

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,601
that is very disruptive.
The consensus seems to be that it is an 

3
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:10,080
emotion that is always disruptive.
Do you agree with this?

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,820
No,
that's absolutely ridiculous.

5
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:16,821
And only modern psychologists and 
probably social psychologists would be 

6
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:20,770
foolish enough to even dare deposit 
sense something so absolutely observed.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,660
Psychopathy and shamelessness are the 
same thing.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,600
So shame isn't shame.
No emotion is always destructive.

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,490
Any emotion taken to an extreme can be 
disruptive,

10
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,990
just like any value taken to an extreme,
you know,

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,250
made into one thing can be destructive.
So,

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,250
um,
joy can be destructive.

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:49,330
I mean,
people who are manic are in some sense 

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,010
possessed by a radical excess of 
positive emotion and they,

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,100
they get incredibly impulsive and so,
and it's terribly destructive.

16
00:00:55,201 --> 00:01:00,201
I mean,
there's almost no form of insanity 

17
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:02,511
that's more destructive than mania.
People will go out and spend all their 

18
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:06,081
money,
all their family's money and well and 

19
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:09,951
engage in all sorts of hyper optimistic 
interactions with the world.

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,840
It will result in their complete rude.
So,

21
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,930
you know,
people think of happiness as an 

22
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:17,930
untrammeled positive.
Well,

23
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,570
if you think of happiness as positive 
emotion,

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,300
which is partly true because it's also 
the absence of negative emotion.

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,760
If you think of happiness as only a 
good,

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,790
then you have no idea about the 
pathologies of positive emotion and 

27
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,870
their manifold and shame.
It's like if you do something stupid and

28
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:38,871
destructive to yourself or to yourself 
and the broader social community,

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,840
you should feel shame and you should pay
attention to it and you should learn 

30
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,110
from it,
and if you're not capable of doing that,

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,160
that then people should stay the hell 
away from you because you're shameless,

32
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,400
and of course for most of western 
history,

33
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:58,401
and I don't know enough about other 
forms of history to also make the same 

34
00:01:58,401 --> 00:01:58,680
comment to call someone.
Shameless was,

35
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:01,140
it was.
It was a tremendous insult.

36
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:06,141
It meant that they didn't have enough 
sense to be appalled by their own 

37
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:09,620
pathology and that's.
That's just not a good thing at all.
