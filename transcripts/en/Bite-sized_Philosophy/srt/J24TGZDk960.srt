1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,350
We're having a conversation,
I'm deciding I'm going to listen to you.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,370
Right?
That's different than how people 

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:10,800
generally communicate because usually 
when they communicate,

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,930
they're doing something like,
okay,

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,050
we're going to have a conversation and 
I'm going to tell you why I'm right and 

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,101
all win.
If you agree or maybe you're having a 

7
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:23,040
conversation where I don't know what 
you're trying to do,

8
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:28,041
maybe you're trying to impress the 
person you're talking to so you're not 

9
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,681
listening to them at all.
You're just thinking about what you're 

10
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:30,681
gonna.
Say Next.

11
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:30,681
Okay,
so that's not this.

12
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:35,600
This is.
You might have something to tell me and 

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,910
so I'm going to listen on the off chance
that you'll tell me something that would

14
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:43,911
really be useful for me to know and so 
you could take about it as an as an 

15
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:48,081
extension of the Piagetian.
Piaget talked about the fundamental,

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,500
the fundamentally important element of 
knowledge being to describe how 

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,681
knowledge is sought,
the process by which knowledge is 

18
00:00:57,681 --> 00:00:57,681
generated.

19
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:00,980
Well,
if you agree with me and I find that 

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,410
out,
I know nothing more than I knew before.

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,470
I just know what I knew before hand.
Maybe unhappy about that because it 

22
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,430
didn't get challenged,
but I'm no smarter than I was before,

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,350
but maybe you're different than me and 
so while I'm listening to you,

24
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,440
you'll tell me something I wouldn't.
I don't like.

25
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,590
Maybe it's something I find contemptible
or difficult,

26
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:21,591
whatever.
Maybe you'll find you'll tell me 

27
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:23,631
something I don't know and then I won't 
be quite as stupid and then maybe I 

28
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:25,680
won't run painfully into quite as many 
things.

29
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,840
And that's a really useful thing to 
know.

30
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:32,841
Especially if you live with someone and 
you're trying to make longterm piece 

31
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:34,840
with them as they are not the same as 
you and they're away.

32
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,860
They look at the world and the facts 
that they pull out of the world aren't 

33
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,381
the same as your facts and even though 
you're going to be overwhelmed with the 

34
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:44,790
proclivity to demonstrate that you're 
right,

35
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,290
it is the case.

36
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,290
The two brains are better than one,
and so maybe nine of the 10 things they 

37
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:56,040
tell you are dispensable or maybe even 
49 out of 50,

38
00:01:56,041 --> 00:02:01,041
but one thing all you need to get out of
the damn conversation is one thing you 

39
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:05,121
don't know.
And one of the things that's very cool 

40
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:07,821
about a good psychotherapeutic session 
is that the whole conversation is like 

41
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:12,591
that all you're doing is trying to 
express the truth of the situation as 

42
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,460
clearly as possible.
That's it.

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,240
And so now rogers' proposition,
and I'll tell you why he derived it,

44
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,370
was that if you have a conversation like
that with someone,

45
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,640
it will make both of you better.
It will make both of you with 

46
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,190
psychologically healthier.
So there's an implicit presupposition 

47
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,710
that the exchange of truth is curative.
Well,

48
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:42,710
that's a very cool idea.
I mean,

49
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,860
it's a very deep idea.

50
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,710
Uh,
I think it's the most profound idea.

51
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,310
It's the,
it's the idea upon western civil upon 

52
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,700
which Western civilization,
although not only Western civilization,

53
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:57,540
is actually predicated the idea that 
truth produces health.

54
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,300
But for Rogers that was entire purpose 
of the psycho therapeutic alliance.

55
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,180
You come to see me because you want to 
be better.

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,690
You don't even know what that means 
necessarily.

57
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:10,150
Neither do I.
we're going to figure that out together,

58
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,890
but you come and you say,
look,

59
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:16,180
things are not acceptable to me and 
maybe there's something I could do about

60
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:21,181
that.
So that's the minimal precondition to 

61
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:21,181
engage in therapy.
Something's wrong.

62
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:24,100
You're willing to talk about it 
truthfully and you want it to be better.

63
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Without that,
the therapeutic relationship does not 

64
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,740
get off the ground.
And so then you might ask,

65
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:34,741
well,
what relationships are therapeutic and 

66
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:37,081
answered.
That would be if you have a real 

67
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:37,081
relationship,
it's therapeutic.

68
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:39,130
If it isn't,
what you have is not a relationship.

69
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,530
God only knows what you have.
You're a slave,

70
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,590
they're a tyrant.
You know you're both butting heads with 

71
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,651
one another.
It's a primate dominance hierarchy 

72
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:49,651
dispute.
Oh,

73
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:53,431
I didn't know.
You're like two cats in a barrel or two 

74
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:53,431
people with their hands around each 
other's throats.

75
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:57,550
But what you have is not a relationship.
So alright,

76
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,090
we may say that the greater the 
communicated congruence of experience,

77
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:03,520
awareness and behavior on the part of 
one individual,

78
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,080
that's a reference to the same idea that
I was describing with regards to yoke.

79
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,220
So let's say you come and talk to me and
you want things to go,

80
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:17,221
well,
well I'm going to have to more or less 

81
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:17,221
be one thing because if I'm all over the
place,

82
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,530
you can't trust any continuity in what I
say.

83
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,940
There's no end.

84
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,570
There's no reason for you to believe 
that I'm capable of actually telling you

85
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,750
I'm capable of expressing anything 
that's true.

86
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,440
So the truth is something that emerges 
as a consequences of getting yourself 

87
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,251
lined up and beating all the.
What would you call all the impurities 

88
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:42,370
out of your,
out of your,

89
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,270
out of your soul,
for lack of a better word.

90
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,930
You have to be integrated for that to 
happen and you do that at least in part 

91
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,051
by wanting to tell the truth.
The more the ensuing relationship will 

92
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:57,670
involve a tendency towards reciprocal 
communication with the same qualities.

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,050
So one of the things that I've been 
quite influenced by Rogers,

94
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,230
one of the things I tried to do in my 
therapeutic sessions is first of all to 

95
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,070
listen to really listen and then we'll,
well I listen,

96
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:13,240
I watch and well I'm listening.
Things will happen in my head,

97
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,720
you know,
maybe I'll get a little image of 

98
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,521
something or I'll get a thought or a 
question will emerge and then I'll just 

99
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:20,521
tell the person what that is.

100
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,090
But it's sort of directionless,
you know?

101
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:25,660
It's not like I have a goal except that 
we're trying to make things better.

102
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,870
I'm on the side of the person.
I'm on the side of the part of the 

103
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,990
person that wants things to be better,
not worse.

104
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,650
And so then those parts of us have a 
dialogue and the consequence of that 

105
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,880
dialogue is that certain things take 
place and then I'll just tell the person

106
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,400
what happened.
And it isn't that I'm right.

107
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,490
That's not the point.
The point is,

108
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:49,491
is that they get to have an hour where 
someone actually tells them what they 

109
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:50,830
think.
Here's the impact you're having on me.

110
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,350
You know,
this is making me angry,

111
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,350
this is making me happy.
This is really interesting.

112
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,380
This reminds me of something that you 
said an hour ago that I don't quite 

113
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:01,380
understand,
and the whole,

114
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,970
the whole point is not for either person
to make the proposition or convinced the

115
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:12,521
other that their position is correct,
but merely to have an exchange of 

116
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:17,381
experience about how things are set up 
and it's extraordinarily useful for 

117
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:22,571
people because it's often difficult for 
anyone to find anyone to talk to that 

118
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:22,571
will actually listen.

119
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,090
And so another thing that's really 
strange about this listening is that if 

120
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,301
you listen to people,
they will tell you the weirdest bloody 

121
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:31,400
things so fast.
You just cannot believe it.

122
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,580
So if you're having a conversation with 
someone and it's dull,

123
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,700
it's because you're stupid.
That's why you're not listening to them 

124
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,841
properly because they're weird.
They're like wombats or albatrosses or 

125
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:46,250
rhinoceroses or something like they're 
strange creatures.

126
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,520
And so if you are actually communicating
with them and they were telling you how 

127
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:51,830
weird they really are,
it would be.

128
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,100
It would be anything but boring.
So.

129
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,040
And you can ask questions.
That's a really good way of listening,

130
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,100
but you know one of Roger's points as 
well.

131
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:06,101
You have to be oriented properly in 
order to listen and the orientation has 

132
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:09,761
to be.
Look what I want out of this 

133
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:10,130
conversation is that the place we both 
end up is better than the place we left.

134
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,380
That's it.
That's what I'm after,

135
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,480
and if you're not after that,
you got to think,

136
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,600
why the hell wouldn't you be after that?
What could you possibly be after that 

137
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,801
would be better than that?
You walk away smarter and more well 

138
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:26,570
equipped for the world than you were 
before you had the conversation,

139
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,910
and so does the other person.
Well,

140
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:32,350
maybe if you're bitter and resentful and
angry and anxious and you know,

141
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,140
generally annoyed at the world,
then that isn't what you want.

142
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:39,770
You want the other person to walk away 
worse and Youtube because you're full of

143
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:43,400
revenge,
but you know you'll get what you want if

144
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:48,401
you do that.
So we know from our research that such 

145
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,630
empathic understanding,
so already defined that.

146
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,900
I want to hear you.
I want to hear what you have to say so 

147
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:55,900
we can clarify it and move forward.

148
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,640
I want to have your best interests in 
mind and mine as well,

149
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,030
but you know both at the same time your 
families too.

150
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:04,970
If we could manage that,
we're after making things better.

151
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,480
We know from our research that such 
empathic understanding,

152
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,700
understanding with a person,
not about him.

153
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:15,701
It's such an effective approach that it 
can bring about major changes in 

154
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:18,611
personality.
Some of you may be feeling that you 

155
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:19,340
listen well to people and that you have 
never seen such results.

156
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,490
The chances are very great that you have
not been listening in the manner that 

157
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:24,860
I've described.
Fortunately,

158
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:29,861
I can suggest a little experiment that 
you can do to test the quality of your 

159
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:33,851
understanding.
The next time you get into an argument 

160
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:34,130
with your wife or your friend or a small
group of friends,

161
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:38,150
stop the discussion for a moment and for
an experiment institute this rule.

162
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Each person can speak up for himself 
only after he has first restated the 

163
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,061
ideas and feelings of the previous 
speaker accurately would accurately 

164
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,380
means is they have to agree with your 
restatement.

165
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,830
Now,
that's an annoying thing to do because 

166
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:56,830
if someone is talking to you and you 
disagree with them,

167
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,350
the first thing you want to do is take 
their argument,

168
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:01,290
make the stupidest possible thing out of
it that you can.

169
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,780
That's the straw man,
and then demolish it.

170
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,500
It's like so then you can walk away 
feeling good about it and you primate 

171
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,850
diamonds dominated them really nicely.
So,

172
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,740
but that isn't what you do.
You say,

173
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:18,741
okay,
well I'm going to take what you told me 

174
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:18,741
and maybe I'm even going to make your 
argument stronger than the one you made.

175
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,930
That's useful if you're dealing with 
someone that you have to live with 

176
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:24,420
because maybe they can't bloody well 
express themselves very well,

177
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:28,410
but they have something to say.
So you make their argument strong.

178
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,560
Alright,
then you see what this would mean.

179
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,710
It would mean that before presenting 
your own point of view,

180
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:39,711
it'd be necessary for you to really 
achieve the other speakers frame of 

181
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:42,801
reference to understand his thoughts and
feelings so well that you could 

182
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:44,220
summarize them for him.
Sounds simple,

183
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,620
doesn't it?
But if you'll try it,

184
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:50,160
you'll find that it's the most difficult
thing that you've ever done.

185
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,510
Okay,
good.

186
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,730
We'll leave it at that and then we'll 
see you on Tuesday.
