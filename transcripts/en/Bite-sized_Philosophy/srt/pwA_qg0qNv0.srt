1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,150
I started telling you last week about 
this idea of the voyage to the 

2
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:11,031
underworld and I want to tell you a 
little bit more about that.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,920
You in particular conceptualize the 
voyage to the underworld as a journey 

4
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:24,231
into the unconscious and the unconscious
for the psychoanalyst is a place of 

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,530
fantasy and dream and implicit 
presupposition and habit and that's all 

6
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:32,760
correct.
You know,

7
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:37,761
we,
there is an unconscious and it's 

8
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:39,150
perfectly reasonable to conceptualize it
that way,

9
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:44,151
that the big difference I think between 
the psychoanalysts and the later more 

10
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:48,471
empirical scientists is that the cycle 
analyst sort of envisioned your psyche 

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,830
as a place of living partial 
personalities instead of cognitive 

12
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,110
computational systems.
You know,

13
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:09,111
they,
they took into account the fact that 

14
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,080
you're alive and that the parts of you 
are alive and you know there's,

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,290
there's a neuroscientist named 
[inaudible].

16
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,230
I don't know how to say his name,
Gaza,

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,320
Nigga.
That's wrong because that is adding guy.

18
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,290
Yeah,
I think that's it.

19
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,740
Anyways,
he did some of the earliest experiments 

20
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,490
on split brains and so sometimes if you 
have intractable epilepsy,

21
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:34,491
which I wouldn't recommend by the way,
I'm one of the surgical procedures for 

22
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,940
mediating its negative effects is 
something called a,

23
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,480
you cut the corpus callosum and it's 
very large,

24
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,980
very large structure in the brain that 
connects the two separate hemispheres.

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,300
And No,
it's not obvious why we have two 

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,101
separate hemispheres,
although I'll tell you a little bit 

27
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:55,101
about why I think it is,
but anyways,

28
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:56,970
they do communicate.
And uh,

29
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,450
what [inaudible] demonstrated was that 
you could tell one hemisphere something 

30
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,490
without the other one knowing that both 
hemispheres we're conscious and that the

31
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:14,820
consciousness was somewhat independent.
It really strange.

32
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,120
It's very interesting.
Makes very interesting readings,

33
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,600
reading,
you know,

34
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,440
because it suggests that fragments of 
ourselves,

35
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:27,441
you could think of,
you have fragments of yourself within 

36
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:27,980
you that are like low resolution 
representations of you,

37
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,020
you know,
and the,

38
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:32,190
and the psychoanalysts would think of 
those more as they're kind of like,

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,960
they're kind of like one I giants.

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,400
That might be a way of thinking about 
it.

41
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:37,500
If you were thinking about it in a 
fantastical way,

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,680
so there's the angry you and you know 
you've all come in contact with the 

43
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:46,590
angry you.
It's a rather rigid.

44
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,300
That's the first thing you might say 
about it.

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,480
It's impulsive and short term.
It doesn't think much about the past 

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,400
unless it's bad things about whoever 
you're angry at,

47
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,350
in which case it thinks about them a 
lot.

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,960
It's not too concerned with longterm 
future consequences and mostly at wants 

49
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,611
to be right and you know when angry you 
disappears and normal,

50
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:14,410
you assuming such a thing exists 
reappears.

51
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,920
You can be perfectly shocked about how 
angry you behaved and in fact sometimes 

52
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,060
if angry you really gets out of hand 
like it might in a battle and a war.

53
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,390
It might do things that you just can't 
imagine that you would do and under 

54
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,441
those circumstances you can reveal parts
of yourself to yourself that are so 

55
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:43,531
foreign and so horrifying that it will 
leave you with posttraumatic stress 

56
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:51,061
disorder because it is the case that 
many but not all.

57
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,630
People who suffer from post traumatic 
stress disorder,

58
00:03:55,631 --> 00:04:00,631
especially if it's battlefield related,
get it because of something they did 

59
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,480
rather than something they saw or 
something that happened to them.

60
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,390
And that's really worth thinking about.
You know,

61
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,500
I mean there's a lot of weird potential 
nested inside people and you know,

62
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:16,501
you don't see it under normal 
circumstances because the circumstances 

63
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:19,741
are normal and part of the reason that 
we liked the circumstances to be normal 

64
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,720
is precisely so that we don't see those 
parts of people.

65
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,160
We don't want to see.
