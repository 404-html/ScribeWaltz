1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,640
Alright,
so what does the frame look like?

2
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:04,320
Well,
I think it looks something like this,

3
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:07,290
and this is as far as I can tell,
this is the bare bones.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,180
This is the bare bones of a variety of 
things.

5
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:12,840
It's a barebone story.
It's a bare bone conceptual framework.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,950
It's a bare bone [inaudible] scientists 
to speak in Heideggerian terms.

7
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,350
It's like it's the bare bones world that
you live in.

8
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:22,740
You're always in one of these worlds.
There's no getting out of them.

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,310
You can move from one to another,
but you're always in a world like this 

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,491
and so this is the world that you're in.
You're somewhere because you have to be 

11
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:34,320
somewhere now.
You might not know where that is,

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,440
which means that somewhere that you are 
is chaotic,

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,740
in which case you need to go over your 
past in great detail and figure out 

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:42,780
where you are.

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,250
It's like you're lost,
you're lost,

16
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:47,700
and the problem with being last is when 
you're lost,

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,790
you don't know where to go.
And the problem with not knowing where 

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,300
to go is there's a million places that 
you could go and a million places is too

19
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:58,440
many places for you to go without dying.
So being lost is not good.

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,820
So you need to know where you are.
One of the things that we built online,

21
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:07,821
my partners and I is this program called
past authoring that helps people lay out

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,710
the,
the,

23
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,770
the narrative of their past to identify,
to break their life down into six 

24
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,401
stages,
epochs we called them and then to 

25
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:21,561
identify the emotionally significant 
moments in each park and to write them 

26
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:24,390
out what happened negatively,
what happened positively,

27
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,510
what the consequences were,
what you derive from it,

28
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:29,190
perhaps what you could've done 
differently,

29
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:34,191
perhaps what you learned from it,
all of that so that you can narrow in 

30
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:38,210
zero in on determining precisely where 
it is that you are right now.

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,910
And people are often loathe to do that 
because they actually don't want to know

32
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,940
because they'd rather be spread out in a
sort of half blind manner in the fog.

33
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,740
Hoping that the place that they're at is
better than it really is.

34
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,890
And deluding themselves by remaining 
vague than to figure out I'm right here 

35
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,451
right now with these specific problems,
but it's actually better to to do that 

36
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:06,240
because if you have a set of specific 
problems and you've really narrowed them

37
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:11,241
down and really specified them,
then you can probably start fixing them 

38
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:14,850
and you can start fixing them and Mike 
Microwave's bit by bit,

39
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:17,160
but there's no way you can do that 
without knowing where you are.

40
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,820
It's impossible and you can kind of tell
if you don't know where you are.

41
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,150
It's quite straightforward.
If you are haunted by reveries of the 

42
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:31,170
past for events that are older than 
approximately 18 months.

43
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,170
If they continue to come up in your mind
over and over and your dreams over and 

44
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,591
over,
you haven't extracted the world out from

45
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:44,901
your past experiences.
That potential is still trapped in the 

46
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:48,000
past and to confront the potential means
to confront the dragon of the past.

47
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,600
And of course that's terrifying.
And 17 seriously be terrifying.

48
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:55,260
So for example,
maybe you're vague and ill formed an ill

49
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:57,960
defined because you were abused very 
badly when you were a child.

50
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,410
Four years old.
Something like that,

51
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:02,710
and maybe you were abused by a family 
member because that's generally who does

52
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:05,410
the music and so that just makes it 
worse,

53
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:09,580
and then what that means is that you've 
got a implicit.

54
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,790
You had an implicit encountered with 
malevolent evil that no,

55
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,960
you've had a direct encounter with 
malevolent evil,

56
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:21,370
but you have an implicit hypothesis of 
malevolent evil that's plaguing you.

57
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,360
It's still there.

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,130
It's trapped in the memories,
right?

59
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,490
It's trapped in the representational 
structure and as an adult you're now 

60
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,301
faced with the necessity of articulating
that fully before you have any chance 

61
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:34,990
whatsoever of freeing yourself from it.
And so that's no joke.

62
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:36,850
Lots of times people have to go into the
past.

63
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,430
That's what the psychoanalysts do and 
say,

64
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,460
look,
here's something came along and just 

65
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,400
bloody well knocked me over and it isn't
even that I repressed it,

66
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,690
which,
which I think was,

67
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,450
well,
we won't talk about Freud's errors 

68
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:52,450
because freud was a genius,
so we'll just leave him alone.

69
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,980
But,
but sometimes it's not repression.

70
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:58,981
It's just the terrible things happen to 
people at such a young age that there 

71
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:01,660
isn't a bloody chance in hell that they 
can figure out why they happened or what

72
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:05,350
to do with them or what they mean,
and then you can carry that with you and

73
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:06,220
you carry it with you.

74
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:11,490
It's like fear your.
Your body encounters the world in stages

75
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:13,390
and it happens very rapidly.
Well,

76
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,600
it can extend over years,
but the initial stages happened very 

77
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:18,600
rapidly.
So for example,

78
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,070
if you're walking down the road and you 
hear a large noise be a loud noise 

79
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,070
behind you,
he'll go like this.

80
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,050
That's a Predator defense response by 
the way you crouched down and that's to 

81
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,640
stop something from jumping on your back
and getting out your neck too easily.

82
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,250
That's like a few,
a few hundred milliseconds.

83
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:38,251
It's really faster,
even faster than that and it better be 

84
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:38,251
because something like a snake,
but we'll say,

85
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:40,690
can nail you just right now so you 
better be fast,

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,000
but it's low resolution.
It's like dangerous snake,

87
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:46,540
something like that or danger,
predatory cap.

88
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,570
It's that faxed and then you can unravel
that and categorize it,

89
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,140
but that takes time.
You do that with emotion and then you do

90
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:58,800
it with cognition and you can do that 
with longterm thinking,

91
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,670
you know,
because maybe you've encountered someone

92
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:05,671
specifically malevolent and predatory at
work and it happens to people a lot who 

93
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:09,681
was operating as a,
as a destructive bully and who seems to 

94
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:13,621
have no positive function whatsoever and
he's the only living that out and then 

95
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,670
you know,
you don't know what to do about it.

96
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,520
So you're,
you're in prey mode.

97
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,220
I don't mean this kind of mode,
although that would help too,

98
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,490
but I mean you're acting like a prey 
animal and then you have this terribly 

99
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,211
complex thing to decompose,
which is what the hell is up with this 

100
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:31,090
person?
Why are they making my life miserable?

101
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,600
What is it about B that allows them to 
make my life miserable?

102
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,500
That's a nasty little road to walk down 
and you're stuck with having to.

103
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,390
You're stuck with having to decompose 
it.

104
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Maybe you can't.
Maybe formulating and explicit 

105
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,940
philosophy of good and evil to deal with
something malevolent in your environment

106
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,530
actually just happens to be beyond you 
and that could easily be.

107
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:58,531
It's certainly the case for people who 
are young and it's the case for plenty 

108
00:05:58,531 --> 00:05:59,690
of adults as well.
It's no simple thing to matt to manage.

109
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,020
It's something too that often soldiers 
who have posttraumatic stress disorder 

110
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,230
have to do because they've encountered 
terrible things.

111
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,130
They've either done them or read into 
them and they need to update their moral

112
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:15,131
model of the world or if they end up in 
something close closely approximating 

113
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:20,240
hell anyway,
so you need to know where you are.

114
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,460
That's this.
What is.

115
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,610
Where are you?
So you're navigating your navigator.

116
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:27,130
You're a sailor on an ocean,
man.

117
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,280
That's what.
That's what you are.

118
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:31,430
You're a mobile creature.
You're going from point a to point b all

119
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:33,890
the time.
You're not sitting there glued to a rock

120
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:36,260
like some brainless,
you know,

121
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,500
sea creature.
There's a funny little creature called a

122
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:43,501
hydra.
Very simple little creature needs 

123
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:44,660
juvenile stage.
It has a brain because it swings around,

124
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:49,661
but then when it turns into an adult,
it latches itself to Iraq and promptly 

125
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:54,311
digests it's brain because if you're 
just sitting on a rock and you're not 

126
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:54,311
moving,
you don't need a brain.

127
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:55,130
So,
but that's not our issue,

128
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,380
right?
We're zipping around in the world and so

129
00:06:57,381 --> 00:07:00,020
we're navigating agents.
So to navigate,

130
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,910
there's two things you need to know and 
the first is where the hell are you?

131
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,980
Exactly.
Precisely right.

132
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:12,070
Razor sharp.
What's good about you and what's bad 

133
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,920
about you buy your own buyer own 
reckoning.

134
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:14,900
You don't have to.
You can ask other people,

135
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,380
but this is a game you play yourself.
It's like as far as I'm concerned,

136
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:24,190
I'm taking star.
What is it that's okay about being what 

137
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,921
needs some work and you got to watch to 
not be too self critical when you're 

138
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:27,770
doing that too,
because that can just be another kind of

139
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:28,130
flaw.
