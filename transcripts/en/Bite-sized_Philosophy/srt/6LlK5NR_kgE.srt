1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,740
The only people who now get married are 
people who are relatively wealthy.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,530
You know the fact that we've disrupted 
the structure of marriage as an 

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,791
institution since about 1965 say what 
that's meant what that has meant is that

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,320
it's its benefits are now only available
to people who are privileged so you can 

5
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:23,340
look up the Stout's yourself.
But if you're middle class and above the

6
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:28,341
divorce rates haven't moved much since 
the early 70s if you're working class 

7
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:34,181
and below it's a complete catastrophe.
And what that's meant is that most meant

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,490
many children who are in.
Rougher socioeconomic straits are being 

9
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:45,251
raised by a single person who has 
absolutely and 100 percent overwhelmed 

10
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:50,141
by their multiple commitments right full
time responsibility for children and 

11
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:55,361
generally in employment in 
extraordinarily dismal low paying 

12
00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:59,860
unstable and exploitative job.
So to me if you if you're like you guys 

13
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:05,471
are you're all going to be middle class 
or above in all likelihood it's like 

14
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:08,141
it's fine for you.
It's not going to make a bloody bit of 

15
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:08,141
difference.
All things considered but for people who

16
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:11,660
are poor it's just been a catastrophe.
So.

17
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,570
So.
Yes.

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,870
Oh well there's all sorts of reasons.
I mean first of all it's become socially

19
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:29,260
acceptable.
Right.

20
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,490
Divorce wasn't socially acceptable.
And you can say well that's that was 

21
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,490
pretty hard on people who wanted to get 
divorced.

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,520
It's like yeah obviously any rule is 
hard on people that break it but that 

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,390
doesn't mean that there shouldn't be 
rules you know.

24
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,970
Now what rules there should be.
That's a whole different issue.

25
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,890
Out of wedlock child birth has become a 
norm.

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,720
It was absolutely rare in the 90s in the
early 1960s vanishingly rare.

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,200
And that's become it's it's acceptable 
even though all the evidence suggests 

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,570
like if you actually look at the 
evidence it's absolutely clear that kids

29
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:06,440
who have two parents do better than kids
who have one.

30
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,110
Now you know people when you tell people
that they'll tell you an anecdote about 

31
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,801
someone they knew maybe their own parent
who did a wonderful job of raising them 

32
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:17,760
as a single person.
It's like the anecdotes are irrelevant.

33
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,250
What's relevant is the bulk of the 
evidence.

34
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,690
Of course there are situations where 
people are better apart than together.

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,080
And of course there are situations where
one person can do a better job than two 

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,801
people who are at each other's throats 
but it's aggregate it's aggregating 

37
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:39,001
examples that you use when you're doing 
a scientific survey and the results of 

38
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,980
those surveys are crystal clear.
You know the other thing that's going to

39
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:45,981
happen it's going to happen very soon is
that there is going to be a very very 

40
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:48,810
very very large number of elderly 
people.

41
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,890
Who are low and.

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,240
B and elderly and a loan like no family 
that is not something you want to look 

43
00:02:57,771 --> 00:03:00,620
forward to especially when you start 
thinking that you're going to be elderly

44
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:05,621
for like 40 years.
So you know because say say it starts 

45
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:08,050
around 65.
I don't know how long you guys are going

46
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:13,051
to live but it's probably 95 is not an 
unreasonable estimate and it might be 

47
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:17,701
longer than that.
So because you know we're adding about 

48
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:18,970
three months to the total lifespan every
year.

49
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,450
Right.
That's the rate of technological 

50
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:25,450
improvement in relationship to overall 
mortality.

51
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,720
So you know and that the degree to which
we're adding that extra.

52
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,530
LifeSpan is increasing each year.
You know and it may hit yet to the point

53
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:38,900
where we're increasing lifespan a year 
every year.

54
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:44,030
Now I doubt it because it probably is.
It will probably be in a asymptote but.

55
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,240
It has been increasing for a very long 
period of time.

56
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,690
So you know.
It's one thing to think about the 

57
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,090
maximization of day to day freedom when 
you're between say 15.

58
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,470
And 40 45 after that.
That's a whole different story.

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,830
And but modern people never think about 
the last half of their life.

60
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,770
No soul.
Why.

61
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,200
I don't know but maybe they're afraid to
or something.
