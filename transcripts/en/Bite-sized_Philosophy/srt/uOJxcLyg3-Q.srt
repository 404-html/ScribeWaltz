1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,210
Do you have problems in your life that 
you're not addressing that you could 

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,180
solve and answer is yes,
and it's an easy thing to figure out.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,320
You sit on your bed one morning and say,
okay,

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,220
there's some things that need to be done
that I don't want to do that I could do 

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,550
that would make things better.
By the end of the day,

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,590
what are they?
Well,

7
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:24,591
your,
your conscience will deliver those 

8
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:25,200
suckers no time flat now,
and then you might have to say,

9
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:27,840
okay,
well how do I entice myself into doing a

10
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:32,841
few of those and if you ask,
instead of trying to force yourself to 

11
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:35,520
do it like you're a tyrant and a slave 
at the same time,

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,760
you can usually negotiate with yourself 
so that you'll start to sort those 

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,970
things out,
sort them out,

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,000
put your house in order and then move 
out.

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,240
Move on and out.

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,380
Yes,
that's a freudian slip by the way.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,900
So it's important because the thing is 
you have a practice domain,

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,100
right?
There are,

19
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:03,030
there are things that are within your 
grasp that you could fix.

20
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,350
Fix them and you'll learn.
You'll learn because it's harder than it

21
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:12,351
looks.
Fix them and you'll learn how to fix 

22
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:13,380
things and then something else will 
beckon as another problem that you could

23
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:14,490
fix.
You know,

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,460
you all have your problems.
What does that mean?

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,410
Like there's an infinite number of 
problems in the world.

26
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:21,420
Some of them happened to be yours.
Why is that?

27
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,720
I don't know exactly,
but you have your problems.

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,580
Great.
Solve them.

29
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,410
You know,
one of the things I learned as a 

30
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,771
therapist,
every therapist has to learn this 

31
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:36,860
because one of the things you wonder 
when you're first starting to be a 

32
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,681
clinician is how do you not take the 
catastrophes of your client's home with 

33
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:39,681
you?

34
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:42,210
And the answer to that is because it's 
immoral to.

35
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,040
They're not your problems,
their,

36
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,090
their problems,
like their,

37
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:49,170
their,
their life.

38
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,120
You know,
your problems are your life.

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,240
You don't want to solve someone else's 
problems for them because you take away 

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,631
the deep meaning.
That's to be found in having them work 

41
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,620
through the problems on their own and 
then you steal the credit.

42
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,420
Well,
I can help you with that.

43
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,680
It's like,
well,

44
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,090
yeah,
maybe,

45
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:08,310
but I don't help you with the next 
problem.

46
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:10,500
Then.
So in any case,

47
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:14,010
you sort sort out the problems that are 
right in front of you and you will.

48
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,220
It will make you grow very,
very rapidly and then you'll be able to 

49
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,710
sort out more complex problems without 
making them worse.
