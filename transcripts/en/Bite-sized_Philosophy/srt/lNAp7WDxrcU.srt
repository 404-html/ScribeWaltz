1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,160
You know,
I'm always curious about the,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,360
let's say,
the practical implications of scientific

3
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:08,580
research both at a,
at a personal level,

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,230
familial level,
social level,

5
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,370
all of those things.
You know.

6
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:16,371
So I mean one of the things that I'm 
planning to do in the near future is to 

7
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:20,061
launch a website that will enable people
to assess themselves with what we've 

8
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:24,191
developed.
A scale called the big five aspects 

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:24,600
scale that breaks the big five down into
10 aspects,

10
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:29,601
each of which,
which provide some additional high 

11
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:31,440
resolution and useful descriptions of 
personality.

12
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:34,020
So you build to go there and find out 
what your personality is like.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,780
You'd be able to compare yourself to 
other people who,

14
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:41,781
you know,
to find out where your similarities and 

15
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:44,091
differences are.
But one of the things we've been 

16
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,191
thinking about doing as well is putting 
up on the same side or real Iq test.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,760
Nicely validated.
Probably focusing on fluid intelligence 

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,810
because it's a little bit less 
linguistically complex to do so.

19
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:59,811
But maybe measuring verbal intelligence 
and then showing people the strata of 

20
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:04,050
occupations in which they're likely to 
find maximal success.

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,640
Because you know,
from,

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,190
for me,
given that I know that,

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,210
that people vary in their cognitive 
abilities tremendously and that that's 

24
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:13,740
actually an important determinant of 
their life outcome,

25
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,830
it seems to me.
So let's say someone tests out in an icu

26
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:20,100
of around a hundred and 50,
and so you can say,

27
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:20,670
look,
you know,

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,190
you're pretty damn smart.
You're,

29
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,990
you're up above 85 percent of the 
general population.

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,170
You could,
you could probably do a pretty damn good

31
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,170
job as an undergraduate in university if
you're also disciplined,

32
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,820
right?
If you were conscientious,

33
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:34,740
he hit the books hard,
you're gonna,

34
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,800
you're gonna come out in the top core 
tile of your class,

35
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:40,410
assuming that you're not at a 
spectacularly successful,

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,480
a spectacularly selective university,
but you're going to have a much more 

37
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:49,980
difficult time as a master's student and
phd level stuff is going to be.

38
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,770
You're going to be pushing your luck to,
to really master that.

39
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,960
But you know,
you could be,

40
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,000
here's a,
here's a domain of,

41
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,900
of,
of,

42
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,040
of,
uh,

43
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,190
what would you call it?
Industrial organizational activity where

44
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:05,040
you could really be in the top 10 
percentile.

45
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,850
You know,
it's like,

46
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,150
so if you have an Iq of 115,
like you might make one bang up plumber 

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,520
and you could have a spectacularly 
successful career as a plumber and maybe

48
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:17,670
as a manager of other plumbers and all 
of that and you know,

49
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,870
and I actually happened to be a real 
emphasis,

50
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:24,871
he announced at one of the trade.
So I certainly don't think of that as 

51
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:27,381
something that's a,
that's a low quality or low status 

52
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:27,900
occupation in the least.
But we would,

53
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,180
we would like to tell people,
okay,

54
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,760
heres,
heres,

55
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,540
here's a,
here's an intellectual domain that's 

56
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,361
probably too high for you to be 
successful without working insane hours 

57
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:44,690
to,
to,

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,350
to close the gap because you can do that
within St.

59
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,560
work up to some,
some limited degree.

60
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,890
But it seems to me that the logical 
thing to do at least in part is to give 

61
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,611
people a sense of what their advantages 
and limitations are and then say to 

62
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:58,611
them,
okay,

63
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:03,441
well given that here's a place that you 
could go where you could be optimally 

64
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:05,290
successful.
And so,

65
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,340
you know,
that's Kinda my take from a policy 

66
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:10,340
perspective,
let's say,

67
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:10,870
but like what have you thought about,
you know,

68
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,670
the massive diversity and intellectual 
ability,

69
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,690
you mean what are the implications from 
a policy perspective as far as you're 

70
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:18,690
concerned?

71
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,960
Well,
I think vocational guidance is clearly 

72
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,211
one.
I actually did some consulting and some 

73
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:27,350
research for a nonprofit group called 
the Johnson O'connor Foundation,

74
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:31,920
which is a vocational testing.
They're not that big on ge,

75
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,370
but they have their own battery of 
tests.

76
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,680
They bring someone in and do a full day 
of,

77
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:43,681
of cognitive tests.
And from that they give some advice 

78
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:48,071
about what kinds of professions match 
their cognitive strengths and 

79
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:53,051
weaknesses.
And I actually did some brain imaging a 

80
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:55,100
on their tests and it was very 
interesting stuff.

81
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,890
Did you think they do because it's hard 
to do the psychometrics properly with 

82
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,890
regards to vocational guidance because 
we don't really know.

83
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,950
We don't have a good handle on how to 
classify jobs into their various 

84
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,881
subtypes.
Like John Holland has done some good 

85
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:14,881
work doing that,
but,

86
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:15,910
but there's so many jobs and it's hard 
to figure out.

87
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,120
Well,
what makes two jobs the same or similar,

88
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:19,480
you know?

89
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,630
No,
I was at Hopkins when Hollen was there 

90
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,931
in some of my friends were graduate 
students work for him and I learned all 

91
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:29,260
about that vocational testing.
That's very powerful.

92
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,830
And as you know,
it's,

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that's more of his,
his scales have kind of morphed into 

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
more personality.
White dementia.

95
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,740
Yeah.
Well that's it.

96
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,800
That's exactly the nexus that we want to
play out.

97
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:44,200
It's like okay,
because there is a reason.

98
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,030
I know people have been mapping Holland 
Holland job categories onto the big five

99
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,050
and we have a fair bit of success,
you know,

100
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,880
and we're hoping that the 
differentiation down to the 10 levels of

101
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,070
personality will provide even more 
precision.

102
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,220
But,
but with more general policy let.

103
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay.
So fine.

104
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:05,050
So reasonable vocational counseling.
That's a good idea.

105
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,170
When does it start?
Just starting junior high,

106
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,250
like do you do what the Europeans do and
start to track people into trades and,

107
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,440
and,
and higher education at that kind of 

108
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:17,440
early age.
Your

109
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,460
opinion seemed to have had great success
with that.

110
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:21,850
So it's certainly Germans in particular.
Yeah.

111
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,850
So reasonable to look at.
But the problem in the United States,

112
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:30,851
there were so many problems with the way
we conceptualize education and the whole

113
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:37,220
idea of tracking.
I don't know how it is in Canada,

114
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:42,221
but in the United States,
this idea of tracking it has a very 

115
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:42,350
negative balance.
Do it,

116
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,320
you know,
segregating the smart kids into one,

117
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,710
one a set of classes and the less smart 
kids into others.

118
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,970
And then there's remedial education and 
there's been a tendency,

119
00:05:55,971 --> 00:06:00,971
a strong tendency,
the United States to feel that kids are 

120
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:05,151
learning from each other.
So you don't want homogeneous groups 

121
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:05,870
based on learning ability,
your want.

122
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,600
It's so funny because people say that 
with regards to two,

123
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,960
let's say academic achievement,
but they play exactly the opposite.

124
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:19,650
Stumped when it comes to such things as 
has childhood sports.

125
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,290
You know.
So if you look at football for example,

126
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,220
it's like,
well hey,

127
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:28,221
let's segregate like ability.
It's like you don't have the people who 

128
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:28,710
stumble around on the field dropping the
ball all the time,

129
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:32,160
playing with the top end quarterbacks 
and nobody thinks there's a problem with

130
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:37,161
that is they don't say,
well everyone learns from everyone else 

131
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:40,221
in that situation.
So to me it speaks more of a refusal to 

132
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,440
admit to the stark reality that there 
are massive cognitive differences 

133
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,071
between people and to try to actually 
start to address that with some degree 

134
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:50,670
of seriousness and the serious should be
something like,

135
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,800
okay,
well let's look at the bottom 15 percent

136
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:55,140
of the population cognitively speaking.

137
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,760
It's like what the hell can we do for 
those people that's going to be useful?

138
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:04,761
And you know,
like the guy that I was telling you 

139
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:06,831
about,
I was trying to think of some way that 

140
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:09,141
he could find a,
a respectable and productive and 

141
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:13,410
relatively stable position in society 
that would be useful.

142
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:15,300
And I thought there was a couple of 
things he could do.

143
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,160
Like one of the things he could have 
done,

144
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:20,340
I think he could have been encouraged,
let's say,

145
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,850
to to collect trash in the downtown 
areas like he could have been assigned a

146
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:29,460
city block and it could have been said 
to him,

147
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:32,580
look,
your job is to keep this damn city block

148
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,190
clean.
Here's a bag,

149
00:07:35,191 --> 00:07:36,780
here's the stick.
You get up in the morning,

150
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:39,450
you go do this.
It's like it makes everybody's life more

151
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:41,910
pleasant.
It's a valuable contribution.

152
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,090
It's something you could do with a 
certain degree of pride and it and 

153
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:47,090
there's a socially valuable end of it.

154
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,690
Now what happens in Toronto is that 
people drive around these vacuum cleaner

155
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:56,691
machines on sidewalks and pick up the 
scrap paper and all of that actually 

156
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,390
turns out to be a very cognitively 
demanding job because,

157
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,610
well,
you have to pay careful attention.

158
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:07,611
You can't run over people.
You have to have decent social skills 

159
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:08,970
and you know it's complicated,
but it might be nice to see,

160
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:12,090
but we were not mature enough to have a 
discussion like this.

161
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,430
As a society.
We might want to say is like,

162
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:19,431
okay,
well there's a group of people who 

163
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:19,431
aren't going to be able to compete in 
the,

164
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:24,050
in the cognitive workplace,
they're not going to do it and there's 

165
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:29,751
actually lots of them and we're not 
going to say they're lazy and we're not 

166
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:29,751
going to say they're not looking for 
work.

167
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:30,750
We're not going to say any of that.
We're going to say,

168
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:35,751
look,
we need to find occupations that have 

169
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,160
public utility that aren't just make 
work projects that people have.

170
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:46,161
That level of abstract capacity could 
actually perform,

171
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,410
but I don't think we have the maturity 
to have that conversation.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We don't have the economics.
And so I would go even a little to the 

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,210
left of you and I would say there's 
wrong with work programs,

174
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,240
you know,
to,

175
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,670
to allow people to work with dignity so 
you have that option.

176
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,530
But you also had this interesting 
experiment being proposed on the minimum

177
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:11,550
annual income.

178
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Well,
that one worries me because see if 

179
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:17,520
there's a couple of things about that 
when it concerns me because,

180
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,430
you know,
so we're having a conversation here 

181
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:22,430
where we're taking,
um,

182
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,910
differences in Iq seriously.
But the problem with the guaranteed 

183
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,620
annual income issue,
I think one of the problems,

184
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,560
and I'm not denying its potential 
utility,

185
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,740
it's something that I think that would 
have to be experimentally determined,

186
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,970
you know,
and all of that.

187
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,170
And maybe it could replace a plethora of
less efficient social welfare programs.

188
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:43,570
But you know,

189
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,720
it isn't obvious to me.
It's obvious to me that there's a 

190
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,700
substantial proportion of the 
population.

191
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:56,701
And I would say it's probably five 
percent that would destroy themselves 

192
00:09:56,701 --> 00:10:00,740
instantly if you gave them a guaranteed 
annual income and they would do it 

193
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,980
because they're very low in 
conscientiousness,

194
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,650
for example.
And very impulsive.

195
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:07,650
And I've worked with many guys,
quite often x,

196
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:12,651
cocaine addicts who were often not all 
that high on the end of the cognitive 

197
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:12,840
distribution,
but very,

198
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:15,570
very low in conscientiousness in 
impulsivity.

199
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,200
And those guys were absolutely fine as 
long as they were flat broke.

200
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,320
But man,
I tell you as soon as they had money,

201
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,530
they were done.
It was like three days in the bar,

202
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,700
cocaine binge face down in a ditch and 
then they were fine until they got money

203
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:32,610
again.
And so I don't.

204
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,970
The problem with the Guarente Dan annual
income solution is that man does not 

205
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:41,300
live by bread alone.
Let's say in the.

206
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,460
If you have money and you have things to
do,

207
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,460
then you have a life.
But if you just have money,

208
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,900
you don't have a life.
