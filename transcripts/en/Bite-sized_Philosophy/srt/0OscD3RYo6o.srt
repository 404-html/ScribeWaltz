1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,450
Alright,
so you're always in one of these little 

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:05,450
frameworks and there's just no getting 
out of it.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:05,640
So,
and that's because you know,

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,850
at any given moment this is like,
it's like field theory.

5
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:13,851
There used to be psychological theories 
that talked about the field of human 

6
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:14,010
experience,
something like that.

7
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:19,011
And this is kind of what that is.
This is a field and basically what 

8
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:22,971
happens is you parse out a little part 
of the world say and so an amount you 

9
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:27,230
can handle.
So let's say it has some duration.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,520
You're not aiming at something 50 years 
in the future.

11
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:31,260
It's because how the hell are you going 
to do that?

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,350
There's too many variables,
you know,

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,580
so you're aiming at some handleable 
amount of time and you,

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,810
it a goal in there and you plot your 
route and then that tells you what's up 

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,390
and tells you what's down.
[inaudible]

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,700
moves you towards the goal and down 
moves you away from the goal and that 

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,050
sets up your motivational framework so 
that you have some worth attaining.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,200
You know,
that's a really interesting thing to 

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,200
know too.
It's like why have a goal ball?

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,920
It's easy,
no goal,

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,040
no positive emotion because you 
experienced positive emotion by noticing

22
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:09,471
that you're moving towards a goal and so
if you don't have to have a goal while 

23
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:12,210
you can't have any positive emotion,
so better have a goal,

24
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,950
and so you might say,
well,

25
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:15,900
what should the goal be?
Well,

26
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:17,160
we could start by saying,
well,

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,040
any goal is better than none,
and then we might say,

28
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:25,041
well,
it should be a goal that other people 

29
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,170
will let you pursue because otherwise 
it's going to be kind of difficult and 

30
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,410
maybe there'll be even happy to help you
pursue it.

31
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,440
That would even be better and maybe it's
a goal that would enable you to learn 

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,520
how to pursue other goals while you 
pursue that goal.

33
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,290
Boy,
that would really be good,

34
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,950
and so you can see that your goal is 
parameterized,

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,650
but that doesn't mean that any old goal 
works.

36
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:47,220
It means there's some goals that were 
nicely and some not so nicely.

37
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:49,770
There are playable games and no 
unplayable games.

38
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,460
That's a good way of thinking about it 
and you want to have a playable game and

39
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:55,440
there's a lot of them.
Lawyer,

40
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,000
plumber,
you know,

41
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,190
actor,
whatever,

42
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,750
they're,
they're playable games and,

43
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:06,751
and it's not obvious which ones better,
but it's certainly obvious which ones 

44
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,971
are sustainable and which ones are worse
and so there's a set of playable games 

45
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:13,170
and you need to extract from that set of
playable games,

46
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,980
a game that suits you and that would be 
partly due to your temperament,

47
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:21,981
you know,
because extroverted people want to play 

48
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:24,021
an extroverted game and highly neurotic 
people want to play a safe game and 

49
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:28,280
agreeable people want to play a generous
game and disagreeable people wanting to 

50
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,080
play a game that's highly competitive so
they can win and you know,

51
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,410
fine,
but they're all within the realm of 

52
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,340
playable games and that means they're 
socially acceptable as well.

53
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,110
And so that means it isn't just 
arbitrary,

54
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,500
it isn't just relative what you decide 
to do.

55
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:48,870
It's heavily parameterized.
There's only,

56
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,350
there's a set of playable games and it's
large.

57
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:54,220
The set is large,
but it,

58
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,290
there are commonalities within it.
And that's why there are commonalities.

59
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,290
That's why morality has a common basis 
fundamentally.

60
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,670
And so that's partly what we're trying 
to investigate is like,

61
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,270
what's up?
What does that mean?

62
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,520
What does it mean?
Is there such a thing?

63
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,910
Now,
one thing to remember is that if you 

64
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,110
don't direct a hierarchical structure 
with a someday,

65
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Matt,
you got no positive motivation because 

66
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,580
you experience positive motivation in 
relationship to a goal,

67
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:27,730
not from attaining the goal,
that satisfaction,

68
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,460
and besides it's fleeting,
you know perfectly well,

69
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,260
you graduate from university,
Poof,

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,530
next day you have a problem,
which is what do you do next?

71
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,750
And that's a,
that's a tough problem.

72
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,230
It's not like you've solved your 
problems by winning that game,

73
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,500
you just introduced the problem of 
having to introduce another game.

74
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,010
So it's unreliable as a source of 
positive emotion.

75
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:52,150
But what's reliable is you set a goal 
and you try to attain it.

76
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,510
And then that gives your life that 
literally provides your life with 

77
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:59,770
meaning.
That's what meaning is.

78
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,290
Now it's more than that,
but that's what it is.

79
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,120
And so then you might ask yourself,
well,

80
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,110
what's a really good goal?
Well,

81
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,690
that's what we're trying to figure out.
What's a really good goal.
