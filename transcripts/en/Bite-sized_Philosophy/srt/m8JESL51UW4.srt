1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,450
It seems to me that the way that you 
fortify your faith in being and in life 

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,111
and your own existence isn't to try to 
convince yourself of the existence of a 

3
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:13,080
transcendent power that you could 
believe in the same way that you believe

4
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:14,750
in a set of empirical facts.
I don't.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,640
I don't think that's the right approach.
I think it's a weak approach.

6
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:19,520
Actually.
I don't.

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,010
I don't think that the cognitive 
technology that I don't think that's the

8
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:25,650
right cognitive technology for that set 
of problems.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,010
You know,
that's more a technology that you use if

10
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:30,630
you were trying to solve a scientific 
problem.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,050
It's more like it's more something that 
needs to be embedded in action rather 

12
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:41,391
than in stateable belief and the way 
that you fortify your faith in life is 

13
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:43,110
to assume the best,
something like that,

14
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:46,400
and then to act courageously in 
relationship to that and,

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,520
and that's,
that's tantamount to expressing your 

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:51,520
faith in the highest possible good.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,110
It's tantamount to expressing your faith
in God and it's not a matter of stating,

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:00,290
well,
I believe in the existence of a 

19
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,290
transcendent that daddy,
because in some sense,

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,860
who cares?
Who cares what you believe.

21
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,600
I mean you might and all that,
but,

22
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,270
but that's not the issue.
That's not the issue.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,600
The issue it seems to me is how you act,
and I was thinking about this intensely 

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,341
when I was thinking about Nietzsche and 
Dostoevsky because of course you know 

25
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:17,640
that nature was the philosopher who 
announced the death of God,

26
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:18,720
right?
And who is a great,

27
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:23,721
great critic of Christianity at vicious 
critic of Institutional Christianity in 

28
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:24,360
the best sense,
you know,

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,780
and he announced the death of God and he
said that we'd never find enough water 

30
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,490
to wash away the blood.
It wasn't a triumphant proclamation even

31
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:35,790
though it's often read that way and 
don't need shoes.

32
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,090
Conclusion from that,
from the death of God,

33
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:41,250
the fact that our ethical systems,
we're going to collapse.

34
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:43,650
When the foundation was pulled out from 
underneath him,

35
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,340
he believed that human beings would have
to find their own values to create their

36
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:52,341
own values.
And there's a problem with that because 

37
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:54,861
it doesn't seem that this is something 
Carl young was very thorough and 

38
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:58,821
investigating,
it doesn't really look like people are 

39
00:01:58,821 --> 00:02:00,950
capable of creating their own values 
because you're not really capable of 

40
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,881
molding yourself just any old way.
You want to be like you have a nature 

41
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:08,691
that you have to contend with and so it 
isn't a matter of creating our own 

42
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:10,380
values because we don't have that 
capacity.

43
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,930
It might be a matter of rediscovering 
those values,

44
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:16,320
which is what young was attempting to do
now.

45
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,310
And,
and,

46
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,340
and so I think nature was actually 
profoundly wrong in that,

47
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,900
in that recommendation.

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,420
I think he was psychologically wrong.
Now you know,

49
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,940
there was the Husky wrote in many ways 
in parallel to Nisha and was a great 

50
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,900
influence on nature.
Their,

51
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:35,901
their lives parallel each other.
To a degree that's somewhat miraculous 

52
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:36,180
in some senses.
It's quite uncanny.

53
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,760
Dostoevsky was obviously a literary 
figure,

54
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:41,550
whether whereas nature was a 
philosopher,

55
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,990
a literary philosopher,
but still have last for Dostoevsky,

56
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,870
wrestled with exactly the same problems 
that,

57
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,980
that nature wrestled with.
And,

58
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,070
but he did it in a different way.
He didn't literary manner and he has 

59
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,881
this great book,
the brothers Karamazov and in that book 

60
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:01,660
there's a hero of the book is really Lee
Osha Who's a monastic novitiate,

61
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,750
a very good guy,
kinda not an intellect,

62
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,140
not an intellect,
but a person of great character,

63
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,490
but he has a brother.
I have an older brother who's a great 

64
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,021
intellect and and a very handsome 
soldier and a brave man and like 

65
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:16,300
Dostoyevsky's villains.

66
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,850
Ivan isn't exactly a villain,
but that's close enough.

67
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,540
Ivan or Dostoevsky makes his villains 
extraordinarily powerful.

68
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,880
So if Dostoevsky's trying to work out an
argument,

69
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:27,790
he,
he clothes the argument in the,

70
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,050
in the flesh of one of his characters 
and if it's an argument he doesn't agree

71
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:37,051
with,
then he makes that character as strong 

72
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,911
as he possibly can,
as strong and as attractive and 

73
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:40,030
intelligent as he possibly can.
And then he let some just have outer.

74
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,060
And so Ivan is constantly attacking Lee 
Osha and from every direction trying to 

75
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:48,240
knock him off his perch of faith,
let's say.

76
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,550
And they'll Osha,
Ellie,

77
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:53,720
Osha can't address a single one of 
Ivan's criticisms and,

78
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,480
and he doesn't have the intellect for 
it.

79
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:56,040
And,
and,

80
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:01,030
and Ivan has a devastating intellect.
It's devastating to him himself as well.

81
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,630
What happens in the brothers Karamazov 
essentially is the lel.

82
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,290
Osha continues to act out his commitment
to the good,

83
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,000
let's say.
And in that manner,

84
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:15,001
he is triumphant.
It doesn't matter that he loses the 

85
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:15,001
arguments because the arguments aren't 
exactly the point.

86
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:18,430
The arguments in some sense are aside 
issue because the issue is,

87
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:23,431
and this is the existential issue,
the issue is not what you believe as if 

88
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:27,781
it's a set of facts,
but how you conduct yourself in the 

89
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:27,781
world.
