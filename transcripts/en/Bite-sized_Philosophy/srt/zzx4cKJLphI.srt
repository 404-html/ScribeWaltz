1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:01,740
No,

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:02,950
yeah,

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,470
you can say things to people like tell,
tell the truth and be good,

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,970
and those are.
Those are cliches obviously,

5
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:13,430
and so they lack power because they're 
cliches,

6
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:18,431
but you can take them apart and utilize 
them in a manner that stops being a 

7
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:22,670
cliche and you do that by being more 
humble about them.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,760
I would say,
because maybe you can't tell the truth 

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:27,760
because you don't know what the truth 
is,

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,691
but one thing you can do is you can 
start saying things that you know to be 

11
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:31,820
untrue and you might say,
well,

12
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:34,790
how do I know that they're untrue?
And the answer to that is,

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,920
well,
you need a whole philosophy of truth.

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,950
The elaboration of an entire philosophy 
of truth to answer that question and so 

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,341
we're not going to bother answering that
question because in some sense at the 

16
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:45,920
moment it's beside the point that isn't 
the issue.

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,130
The issue is there are times in your 
life where you know that the thing that 

18
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:51,830
you're saying is not true.
It's a deception.

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,860
It's a lie of some sort and you're using
it to manipulate yourself or another 

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,430
person or the world and you're also 
possessed,

21
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:03,431
fully possessed of the idea that you can
get away with it and there's a satanic 

22
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:07,301
arrogance about that.
If in fact that is the archetype of 

23
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:10,250
arrogance that's portrayed in the 
mythological character of Satan because 

24
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,081
Satan is precisely the archetype of the 
element of the mind that believes that 

25
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:19,841
it can twist and and banned the 
structure reality without paying the 

26
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:25,181
price for that and you can't imagine 
anything that's more arrogant than not 

27
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:27,950
because really do you really think that 
you can twist the structure of a reality

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,340
and that that's going to work out for 
you without it snapping back.

29
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,500
It's so obvious that that can't work,
that,

30
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,570
that everyone knows it.
But anyways,

31
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:40,571
back to the initial point is that you 
know by by the rules of the game that 

32
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:46,091
you yourself are playing.
That some of the Times you're violating 

33
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:47,480
the rules of the game that you're 
playing.

34
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,990
And the first issue with regards to say,
stating the truth or behaving in a 

35
00:01:53,691 --> 00:01:57,830
responsible manner would be merely 
stopped cheating.

36
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:00,710
At whatever game it is that you've 
chosen to play,

37
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,650
that's a good start and that'll 
straightened.

38
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,990
That'll straighten out your life.
It'll start district.

39
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,020
Start to straighten out your life and so
well the flood.

40
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,060
What?
How does the flood tie into this?

41
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:14,930
Well,
you know,

42
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:17,660
we live in a corrupt structure were 
corrupt as individuals.

43
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:21,410
We live in a corrupt structure and part 
of that corruption is just happenstance.

44
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:26,411
It's the way things fall apart,
but the other part of it is that not 

45
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:28,760
only are we not aiming up,
we're actually aiming down and the flood

46
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:33,761
story is a warning and it's a very clear
warning and the warning is if you aim 

47
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:38,150
down enough and then if enough of you 
aim down at the same time,

48
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,270
everything will degenerate into 
something that's

49
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,130
indistinguishable from the chaos from 
which things emerged at the beginning of

50
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:53,131
time.
It's something like that because that 

51
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,470
the cosmos that's presented in 
mythological representations is chaos 

52
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:55,840
versus order,
right?

53
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:57,340
The order is on top,
you might say,

54
00:02:57,341 --> 00:03:00,910
in the chaos is always underneath and 
the chaos can break through or the order

55
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:04,300
can crumble and you can fall into the 
chaos and that chaos is intermingled,

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,360
intermingled potential,
and the way that you destroy the order 

57
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:14,521
and let the chaos rise back up,
which is exactly how it's portrayed in 

58
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:18,061
the flood story is by well by inhabiting
the corpse of your father.

59
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:23,791
That's one mythological motif and 
feeding on the remains and with no 

60
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:28,350
gratitude and no attempt to replenish 
what it is that you're taking from and 

61
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:34,981
the warning and the flood story is don't
do that for very long because things 

62
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:39,811
will happen that are so awful you cannot
possibly imagine it and that'll happen 

63
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:39,811
to you personally.

64
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:44,580
It will happen to your family and it'll 
happen to your community and it's 

65
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,951
happened to people over and over 
throughout history and it is quite 

66
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:46,951
interesting.
You know it's.

67
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:48,580
It's very soon after the story of Cain 
and Abel.

68
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,510
When you see evil enter the world in the
story of Adam and Eve,

69
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,710
along with self consciousness and evil,
there is the the ability.

70
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,430
That's the knowledge of good and evil.
That's the ability to hurt other people,

71
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,500
self-consciously,
to know what you're doing,

72
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,460
and then of course instantly cane takes 
that to the absolute extreme and he uses

73
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:10,750
that capacity to to destroy really what 
he loves best.

74
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,020
He,
he gets as close as a human being can to

75
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:19,021
destroying the divine ideal because of 
course his brother Abel and Abel is 

76
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:22,650
favored by God and and destroys them.
Which cane tells God at the end of that 

77
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,910
episode that his punishment is more than
he can bear.

78
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,490
And I think the reason for that is where
are you?

79
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:31,240
Once you destroy your own ideal,
what's left for you?

80
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,600
There's nowhere to go.
There's no APP,

81
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,780
and when there is no APP,
there's a lot of down and you know 

82
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,060
there's an idea that was put forth very 
nicely in Milton's paradise lost when he

83
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:46,210
was describing from a psychological 
perspective.

84
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,540
Essentially what hell is hell is your 
inhale to the degree that you're distant

85
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:58,021
from the good,
that that might be a good way of 

86
00:04:58,021 --> 00:04:58,780
thinking about it,
and if you destroy your own ideal,

87
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,050
which you do with jealousy and 
resentment and the desire to pull down 

88
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,140
people who you would like to be,
let's say,

89
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,440
then you end up in a situation that's 
indistinguishable from hell and and the 

90
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,190
way the story,
the biblical story unfolds as well.

91
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:17,191
It's it's Cain and then it's the flood 
and so kane adopts this motive being 

92
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:22,060
that's antithetical to being itself,
at least a positive being itself.

93
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,060
He does it voluntarily.
He does it knowing full well what he's 

94
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,331
doing and the net consequence of this 
that as it ripples through the entire 

95
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,280
social structure is that God stands back
and says,

96
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,340
this whole thing has got so bad.
The only thing we can do is wipe it to 

97
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,330
the ground and that is.
That is no joke.

98
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,390
That's exactly how things work.
And one of the things that's 

99
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,570
extraordinarily terrifying about that 
sequence of stories,

100
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:50,920
and I believe this to be true.
I think I realized this independently of

101
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,300
any of the analysis that I was doing a 
mythological stories because I looked at

102
00:05:55,301 --> 00:06:00,301
what happened in places like the Soviet 
Union and in Mao's China and in Nazi 

103
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:03,620
Germany and the most penetrating 
observers of those societies.

104
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:08,621
The people who are most interested in 
how it was that those absolute 

105
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:10,880
catastrophes came about.
All said the same thing.

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,590
It was rooted in the degeneration of the
individuals who made up the society.

107
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,090
You know,
you hear well,

108
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:18,830
people will fraught were following 
orders.

109
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,450
It's like,
no,

110
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,460
that,
that explanation doesn't hold water or 

111
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,740
that you'd be punished if you resisted.
While there was some truth in that,

112
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:26,510
but nowhere near as much as people might
think.

113
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,070
Especially at the beginning of the 
process more.

114
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:33,530
It was that people decided each and 
every one of them to turn a blind eye to

115
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:38,531
the catastrophes and to participate in 
the lies and that worked the entire 

116
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:38,690
societies.
And they went,

117
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,640
as you know,
they,

118
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,840
they veered their way downward to 
something as closely approximating hell 

119
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,510
as you could hope to manage.
Especially in places like Nazi Germany.

120
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:49,340
And while I in all three of those 
places,

121
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:52,100
and in Maoist,
China and the Soviet Union,

122
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:57,101
and so the thing that's so frightening 
about one of the things that's so 

123
00:06:57,101 --> 00:06:59,510
frightening about the stories in genesis
is they say something very clear,

124
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:04,511
which is that your moral degeneration 
contributes in no small way to the 

125
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:07,310
degeneration of the entire cosmos.

126
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,350
And you say,
well,

127
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,780
I would like my life to be meaningful.
People say that really would you really?

128
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,670
You really would like your life to be 
meaningful.

129
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:20,030
You think maybe people would trade a 
little nihilism to not have to face that

130
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:22,640
particular realization.
And I think people do that all the time.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,580
It's a terrible wait to,
to,

132
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,610
to realize,
but we are networked together and that 

133
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,571
that's the price of.
Or let's say that's the vulnerability 

134
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:36,830
that's associated with our intense 
capacity to communicate.

135
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:42,310
And it is certainly possible that the 
ripples of our individual actions have 

136
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,310
consequences that are far beyond the 
limits of our immediate consciousness.

137
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,430
And I also think people know that too.
They know that in the way that people 

138
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,940
know things when they don't want to know
them,

139
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,190
which means they know them,
embodied,

140
00:07:58,191 --> 00:07:59,900
they can feel them,
they can sense them,

141
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:02,960
they have an emotional response to them,
but there's no damn way they're going to

142
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:07,961
let them become articulate because they 
don't want to know and when you're 

143
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:09,590
feeling guilty and ashamed about the 
things you've done or not done,

144
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,900
and I know that can get out of hand as 
well.

145
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:17,230
It's often because there is a crooked 
little part of you that's aiming at the 

146
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,590
worst possible outcome.
You know,

147
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:20,720
one of the things you said about the 
shadow,

148
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:25,721
you know that young's famous idea that 
everyone has a dark side and that that 

149
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:26,990
dark side needs to be incorporated and 
made conscious.

150
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,610
Young said that to the shadow of the 
human being,

151
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,700
reaches all the way to hell and he 
actually.

152
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,880
That's the thing that's so interesting 
about interesting about reading Carl 

153
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,070
Young,
is he actually means what he says.

154
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,620
It's not a metaphor.
It's like the,

155
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,260
the,
the,

156
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,330
the part of you that's twisted against 
being is aligned with the part of the 

157
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:53,801
cosmos.
Let's say the conscious cosmos that's 

158
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:56,890
aiming at making everything as terrible 
as it can possibly be and you know it's 

159
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,581
a terrible shock to realize that.
It's partly why people don't realize 

160
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:03,630
that it's something that people keep at 
an arm's length.

161
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,190
It's the same as recognizing yourself as
a Nazi concentration camp camp guard,

162
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:13,191
which is a very useful exercise because 
there's absolutely no reason why you 

163
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:16,971
couldn't have been or still could be one
so and if you think otherwise,

164
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,120
then all the more reason for assuming 
that you would be unable to resist the 

165
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,200
temptation if it wasn't in fact offered 
to you.

166
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:26,760
And if you don't think it's a 
temptation,

167
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,060
then the then there's so much that you 
don't know about human beings that 

168
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,560
you're not even in the game.
Because if it wasn't a temptation,

169
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:36,330
then people bloody well wouldn't have 
done it.

170
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,030
And plenty of people did it.
And it's no wonder.
