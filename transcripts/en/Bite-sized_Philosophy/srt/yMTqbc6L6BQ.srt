1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,420
Um,
you get points for that if you stay,

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,340
um,
which is of course a really good point.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,820
You,
you have more abilities to get to a 

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,930
solution.
But that is also like,

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,920
it's also assuming that you will always 
get to a solution.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,300
Yes,
true.

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,200
Yes,
yes,

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:29,870
yes.

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,920
Spend a winning solution that will keep 
them

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:33,850
true.
Well,

11
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:36,040
you know,
there used to be before the divorce laws

12
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:41,041
were really liberalized,
there were there you could sue for 

13
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,711
irreconcilable differences and,
and sometimes people do find themselves 

14
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:48,031
in that situation.
It's like one person wants children and 

15
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:48,790
the other person doesn't like that's a 
tough one.

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,480
It's a tough one to negotiate.
So I'm,

17
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,710
I'm certainly not saying that just 
because you lock yourself into a,

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,230
like two cats in a barrel that,
that will make you solve your problems 

19
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,740
because problems are hard to solve and 
sometimes you can't solve them.

20
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,520
I was just pointing out what the cost 
of,

21
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:13,521
of leaving the back door,
what the cost of leaving the back door 

22
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:13,630
open ends.
And it's a big cost.

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,770
And,
you know,

24
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:19,771
one of the things that I see too is that
people's identities fragment 

25
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:20,380
increasingly across time.
You know,

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,440
one of the things that you have as you 
age is something like the continuity of 

27
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:27,880
your life,
you know,

28
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,440
you,
you,

29
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,490
you have someone that you're with,
you've tied your story together with 

30
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:33,490
theirs,
you have children,

31
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,810
maybe they have children.
It's like there's this continual payoff,

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,900
so to speak,
in quality that you obtained from 

33
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,830
staying within that frame.
And you can jump out of that.

34
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:49,420
And I suppose to some degree that that 
provides freedom.

35
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:51,580
But it isn't obvious to me that it does 
that for people

36
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,130
only that one specific relationship.
It's my email.

37
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,430
No,
but,

38
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,490
but,
but it's also the case that sequential 

39
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,921
relationships are unlikely to be that.
So look,

40
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,100
I,
I'm not,

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,130
I'm not make,
I'm definitely not making a utopian case

42
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:15,260
for marriage.
So

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,920
I would like to hear the case for the 
voice from you because they think it's 

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,080
really interesting.
Right?

45
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:26,081
It says top points,
but at the same time I think there are 

46
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:28,160
relationships that are wanting.
Yup.

47
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,640
And we,
if that's the case,

48
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,950
then insistence on a can cannot be good.

49
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,930
Yeah,
well that's,

50
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,910
that's definitely the alternative 
argument.

51
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:43,660
And of course there are strong things to
be said on both sides,

52
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,230
but see,
there's some,

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,640
there's some additional problems with 
divorce that people don't really grasp 

54
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,880
when they're young,
like the,

55
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,120
that you can be divorced once you have 
children.

56
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,940
That's kind of a stupid idea because you
can't.

57
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,860
You can,
you can,

58
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,370
you can find a limited substitute for 
your initial freedom.

59
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,340
But if you,
if you have kids and you try to get 

60
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,041
divorced,
the probability that that's going to 

61
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:20,041
demolish your life is a very,
very high.

62
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,640
First of all,
it's incredibly expensive.

63
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,560
So one or both of you is going to come 
out of that poor and

64
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,130
your market value has declined.
Let's say you're the woman who takes the

65
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:37,131
kids.
Your market value has declined 

66
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:37,131
radically.
You're going to be poorer.

67
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,310
The man,
he's just a screwed because he is now an

68
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:44,130
indentured servant and there's no escape
from it.

69
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,390
So it's.
And it's not so bad if you can negotiate

70
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:50,400
a peaceful separation and some people 
can,

71
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:52,950
but lots of times if you have a terrible
relationship,

72
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,310
it's not like negotiating and peaceful 
separation is all that easy,

73
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,850
but if you're at each other's throats,
good luck to you.

74
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,510
I think it's roughly equivalent to 
having nonfatal cancer.

75
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,380
It is not pleasant.
It's a 10 year process.

76
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:10,320
Fifteen year process will cost you 
$250,000

77
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,590
and it'll tear a big chunk out of your 
life and also it will really disrupt 

78
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,910
your relationship with your kids.
And you know,

79
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,160
you bring kids into a step.
Parent family,

80
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,000
they do not do as well.
Step parents are not as good as parents,

81
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:26,460
as biological parents.
And the data on that is clear.

82
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Now obviously there are exceptions 
because there are terrible biological 

83
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,370
parents and there are wonderful step 
parents,

84
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,540
but if you look in aggregate,
it's not that easy to care for children.

85
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,370
You need to everything.
You can binding you to them.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And if there's someone else's children,
mostly they get in the way of the person

87
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:47,790
that you love.

88
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,390
Right?

89
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,720
Well,
if I'm,

90
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,300
let's say you have a child,
I'll be right out.

91
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,840
Let's say you have a child and I want to
go out with you every second you spend 

92
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,390
with that child is a second you don't 
spend with me and,

93
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,870
and there's going to be a price for 
that.

94
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,020
I'm not going to be happy about that.
And if I have a child,

95
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,670
you're going to feel exactly the same 
way.

96
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,450
You might say,
well,

97
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:10,350
no,
I love children.

98
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,130
It's like,
yeah,

99
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:12,120
yeah,
sure,

100
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,790
sure you do.
I doubt it.

101
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,180
You might love your child and,
and you know,

102
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:20,430
it's pretty specific the way that people
loved children.

103
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,120
So,
and the rate of abuse for kids in step 

104
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,510
parent families is way higher than it is
in biological families.

105
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,980
There's not even any comparison.
So anyways.
