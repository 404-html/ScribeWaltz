1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,980
No,
it's a very old picture.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,590
It's Jonah emerging from the whale.
It's a variant of a myth.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,400
The Myth is the dragon myth.
I suppose the Dragon Myth is that 

4
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:22,531
there's a dragon that lives under the 
ground that's eternal and now and then 

5
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:28,831
it rises out of the ground to threaten 
the state and someone within the state 

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,910
determines to go confront the dragon 
voluntarily and does so and then brings 

7
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:42,091
back something of great value.
Sometimes if the hero is generally male,

8
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,810
sometimes the thing of great value is a 
female that the dragon has kidnapped.

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,840
That's a St George Story and sometimes 
it's gold and other treasured like in 

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,930
the story of the Hobbit and

11
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,570
story that you all know very well.
It's a classic hero story and the Hero's

12
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:06,990
story is another fundamental element of 
the clinical theories.

13
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:11,991
I would say it's predicated on the idea 
that you learn through voluntary contact

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,210
with that that frightens or disgusts 
you,

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,110
and now it's a hallmark of 
psychoanalytic theory.

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Young Carl young who will discuss in 
detail said his primary dictum was in 

17
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,580
steer Colinas invented tour,
which I'm sure I massacring because it's

18
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:34,950
Latin,
but it meant infill.

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,120
That will be found and one of the 
hallmarks of the clinical theories is 

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,121
that within the confines of everyone's 
experience and you can think about this 

21
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,050
as experience out in the world or 
experience in the unconscious mind,

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,400
there are dirty little secrets let's 
say,

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,310
and skeletons and

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,080
dreadful old fears and remnants of abuse
and memories of pathological behavior 

25
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:11,761
and failures of courage that you leave 
you undeveloped perhaps out of avoidance

26
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:19,111
and that the psychoanalytic process is 
precisely the careful encounter with 

27
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:26,671
those forgotten and and repressed 
elements of the self in the hope that a 

28
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:34,021
clear encounter will redeem them,
unite them with the remainder of your 

29
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:39,220
personality and make you make you 
stronger in consequence,

30
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,820
and I would say that that's just a 
variant of the manner in which human 

31
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,511
beings learn,
and we'll talk about this more in 

32
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,620
relationship to piaget because you 
always learn when you're wrong,

33
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,250
which is very annoying.
Now,

34
00:02:54,251 --> 00:02:56,020
what do you learn when you're correct 
you,

35
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,510
you're walking in the world,
you're operating in the world,

36
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,110
you have a sense of what you want to 
have happen.

37
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,890
You're always looking at the world 
through this sense of what you want to 

38
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:07,890
have happen.

39
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,810
You're acting so that what you want to 
have happen will happen,

40
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,740
and when it happens,
well then you're happy because,

41
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,640
well,
first of all,

42
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:20,290
you get what you want and that's good.
Maybe depending on what you want,

43
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,800
but it's also good because if you get 
what you want when you act,

44
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,300
then it turns out that your model of how
to act is valid right now.

45
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:33,301
Outcome that you get what you want 
indicates no error on the part of your 

46
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:38,071
model,
but it's very frequently the case that 

47
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:42,240
when you act to get what you want,
you don't get what you want and then 

48
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,490
that's unpleasant because you don't get 
what you want,

49
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,940
but it's even more unpleasant because it
brings with it the hint of a suggestion 

50
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,230
that the manner in which you're 
construing the world is incorrect at 

51
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,660
some indeterminant level.
So for example,

52
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,580
if you tell a party,
tell a joke at a party,

53
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,990
you presume that people will attend,
and then when they hear the joke,

54
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,290
they will laugh and then if you tell the
joke and it goes flat or even worse,

55
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,670
disgusts and offends people,
then you're going to be taken aback.

56
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,540
And that's partly because you didn't get
what you want and that's not so good,

57
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:27,541
but it's.
But it's more because there's something 

58
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,630
wrong with the way you conceptualize the
situation.

59
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,110
And then you're faced with a problem.
And the problem is the emergence of a 

60
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,500
domain of the unknown.
It's like,

61
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:37,420
well,
what kind of mistake did you make?

62
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,670
Maybe you're not as funny as you think 
you are.

63
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,070
Not.
That can be a big problem.

64
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,610
Um,
maybe you're not around people that who 

65
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,090
are the way you think they are.
Maybe they don't like you as much as you

66
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:50,890
thought they liked you.
I mean the,

67
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,310
the potential for various paranoid 
thoughts of increasing severity to come 

68
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:00,510
welling up at you in a situation where 
you make a,

69
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,490
even a trivial social mistake is quite 
broad.

70
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,100
And when you make an error of that sort,
you have to face it and sort through all

71
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:14,101
the possibilities so that you can find 
out what it was that you did wrong and 

72
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:19,090
how to retool it so that in the future 
you don't make the same mistake and that

73
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:24,091
requires well,
that requires in some sense what you 

74
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:24,850
might describe as a journey into the 
belly of the beast.

75
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,850
The beast being that place where things 
have fallen apart and where you're 

76
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,530
overwhelmed with negative emotion and 
chaos and confusion.

77
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:37,531
And now it's a very old story.
That's the story of the journey to the 

78
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:41,131
underworld and the hero is the person 
who makes the voluntary journey to the 

79
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:43,750
underworld to collect what's been 
languishing down there.

80
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:47,800
And that's the basic motif of 
psychoanalytic theory.

81
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,100
I would say it's the basic motif in some
sense of clinical practice because one 

82
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:58,861
of the things that you do as a clinician
is find out what people are afraid of 

83
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,900
and what they're avoiding and that can 
be in their past or in their present or 

84
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,981
in their future.
Break it down into smaller pieces and 

85
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:12,320
help them devise strategies of approach 
and mastery,

86
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,740
and that improves the quality of their 
personality and helps develop them into 

87
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:23,270
people who won't make the same mistakes 
over and over again.
