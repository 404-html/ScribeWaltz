1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,490
There's three things that divide women 
and men most,

2
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:04,740
particularly from the psychometric 
perspective.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,530
One is that women are more agreeable 
than men,

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,280
and so that seems to be the primary 
maternal dimension as far as I can tell,

5
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:14,820
it's associated with a desire to avoid 
conflict,

6
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:17,400
but it's associated with interpersonal 
closeness,

7
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:18,690
compassion,
politeness.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,680
Women are reliably higher than men,
especially in the Scandinavian countries

9
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:27,681
and in the countries where 
egalitarianism has progressed the 

10
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:27,681
farthest,
so that's where the difference is.

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,990
Maximize,
which is one of the things James Demore 

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,510
pointed out quite correctly in his 
infamous google memo.

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,610
Okay.
Women are higher in negative emotion,

14
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:40,611
so that's anxiety and emotional pain 
that that difference is approximately 

15
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:44,780
the same size and again that maximizes 
in egalitarian societies which is 

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,221
extremely interesting and then the 
biggest difference is the difference in 

17
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:52,821
interest between people and things and 
so women are more interested in people 

18
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:56,691
and men are more interested in things 
which goes along quite nicely with your 

19
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:59,730
car anecdote,
but the thing about men interacting with

20
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:02,920
Matt and again is that it isn't that 
they respect each other's viewpoints.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,670
That's not exactly right.
What happens with a man,

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,800
and I know a lot of men that I would 
regard as as remarkably tough people for

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,270
one reason or another and everything you
do with them is a form of combat.

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,880
Like if you want your viewpoint taken 
seriously,

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,060
often you have to yell them down and 
like they're not going to stop talking 

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,610
unless you start talking over them.
You know,

27
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:28,611
and it's,
it's not like manner automatically 

28
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:28,830
giving respect to other men because that
just doesn't happen.

29
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:33,831
Instead,
the combat is there and it's expected 

30
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:36,890
and one of the problems.
And so this is part of the reason why I 

31
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,570
think men are being taken out of so much
of academia and,

32
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:43,571
and,
and maybe the academic world in general 

33
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,210
and maybe the world in general,
is that man actually don't have any idea

34
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:46,470
how to compete with women.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Because the problem is,
is that if you unleash yourself 

36
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,470
completely,
then you're an absolute bully.

37
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:57,471
And there's no doubt about that.
Because if men unleashed themselves on 

38
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:58,620
other men,
that can be pretty goddamn brutal.

39
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:01,140
Especially for the men that are really 
tough and this.

40
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:06,141
So that just doesn't happen with women,
but so you can unleash yourself 

41
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:08,130
completely if you,
when you're a bully,

42
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:10,290
if you lose while you're just bloody 
pathetic.

43
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,870
So how the hell are you supposed to play
a game like that,

44
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,290
you know?
So in I've worked with lots of women in 

45
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,890
law firms and in Canada for example,
and high achieving women,

46
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,990
like really remarkable people I would 
say.

47
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,410
And they're often nonplussed I would say
by the attitude of the man in the law 

48
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,151
firm because they would like to see 
everyone pulling together because 

49
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:35,391
they're all part of the same team,
whereas the manner like at each other's 

50
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:39,261
throats in an,
in a cooperative way because they want 

51
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:42,771
the law firm to succeed,
but they want to be the person who's at 

52
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:43,410
the top of the success hierarchy.
Right?

53
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:44,420
So,
and that,

54
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,930
that doesn't jive well with the more 
competitive or cooperative ethos.

55
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:53,910
That's part and parcel of agreeableness.
And so we don't really have any idea how

56
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:58,440
to integrate male and female dominance.
And that's exactly right.

57
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,010
This is why I this show,

58
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,250
real housewives and went to,
which is more sentence scorns and just 

59
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,250
say just last night,
okay.

60
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,560
I was watching an episode right where 
the women were at each other.

61
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,660
Okay.
At a party and in,

62
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,780
in,
in recounting,

63
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,900
but I said this to you,
but you said this to me and you and the 

64
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:15,910
men got.
We got together there and said,

65
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:20,911
well,
this is the way they communicate with 

66
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:20,911
each other and insight in the men we 
men,

67
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:25,790
okay.
Just we'll have a fistfight and wheel 

68
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,801
him in 10 minutes later we're going to 
have a beer at the bar next to each 

69
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:29,880
other and so and I have observed that my
mind fire daughter,

70
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,590
my daughter used to be really irritated 
about that because she,

71
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:38,591
she,
like most people was the target of 

72
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:42,761
feminine.
Conspiratorial bullying when she's no 

73
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:42,761
pushover,
my daughter.

74
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:45,950
So this wasn't like this was a continual
thing or that she didn't know what to do

75
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:50,951
about it,
but she used to observe these girls 

76
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:52,730
conspiring against her and then black 
getting your name on on facebook,

77
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:57,731
which is part of it,
part and parcel of the typical female 

78
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:58,970
bullying routine,
which is often reputation demolition,

79
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:00,560
right?
That there's a good literature on that.

80
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,890
And then she'd watched what would happen
if my brother or my son would have a 

81
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,460
dispute with his friends,
you know,

82
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:09,110
and maybe they were drinking and there 
was a dispute,

83
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:11,250
they'd have a fight and then the next 
day they were friends again.

84
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:16,251
And that's another thing that's strange 
is that men have a way of bringing a 

85
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:18,410
conflict to a head and resolving it 
right.

86
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,620
And that it isn't the obvious to me that
women have that same.

87
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Perhaps you might call it a luxury,
but it's also the case that men don't 

88
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,890
know what to do when they get into a 
conflict with a woman.

89
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:29,660
Because what the hell are you supposed 
to do?

90
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,690
You know?
Mostly what you're supposed to do is 

91
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:34,690
avoid it.
