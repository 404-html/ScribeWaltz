1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,920
There's this thing that exists,
this,

2
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:05,370
this multi-headed snake,
and it's got this infinity problem.

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:07,380
It's everywhere.
That's that little circle down there,

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,540
and the problem is,
well,

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,010
what do you do with it?
You cut off one head,

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,000
seven more,
grow.

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,240
That's the eternal problem of life and 
the problem is they're there.

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,960
There is the category of problems in 
life and it ain't going anywhere.

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,490
And so the question is can you deal with
the whole category at the same time?

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,150
That's the thing.
That's how to be in the world is to deal

11
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:32,700
with that category all at the same time.
And so how did,

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,030
how did human beings,
what did they come up with as a 

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,030
solution?
And that's so cool too,

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,220
because the solution they come up with 
not only was the heroism that allows you

15
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:46,221
to approach what you're terrified by and
what you find offensive and to learn 

16
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:50,391
from it,
but also the idea of sacrifice and that 

17
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:51,990
was played out by cultures everywhere,
including human sacrifice.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,590
And you think what the hell was up with 
those crazy bastard so long ago?

19
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,810
They were sacrificing to the gods all 
the time,

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,020
but kind of clueless behavior was that 
burned something and please God burned 

21
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:05,760
something valuable and please God.
It's like,

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,430
what was with,
what were they thinking?

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,470
Well,
they weren't stupid.

24
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:12,180
Those people,
if they were stupid,

25
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:14,730
we wouldn't be here.
They were not stupid and believe me,

26
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:17,730
they lived under a lot harsher 
conditions than we do.

27
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:20,130
So those were some tough people,
man.

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,250
You know,
back then you'd last about 15 minutes.

29
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:27,360
And so you don't want to be thinking of 
your ancestors as stupid,

30
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,390
like there's no real evidence that we're
much different cognitively than we were 

31
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,390
150,000
years ago.

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,760
So anyways,
sacrifice.

33
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,200
What does that mean?
Sacrifice?

34
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:39,300
Well,
it's a discovery man.

35
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:44,301
It's the discovery of the future.
It's like the future is actually the 

36
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,590
place where there is threat and it's 
always going to be there.

37
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,590
So what do you do?
You make sacrifices in the present so 

38
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,980
that the future is better,
right?

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,980
Everyone does that.
That's what you're doing right now.

40
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,100
That's what you're doing here.
That's what your parents are doing when 

41
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,100
they pay money to send you to 
university,

42
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,420
they think let you can bargain with 
reality.

43
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,390
It's amazing.
You can bargain with reality.

44
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:11,391
You can forestall gratification now and 
it'll pay off at a place in time that 

45
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:16,260
doesn't even exist yet.
It's like,

46
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
who wouldn't believe that?
It's like that's a miracle that that 

47
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,710
occurs and it's not like people just 
figured that out over night,

48
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,260
you know,
we were champs for Christ's sake.

49
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,710
Like how are we going to come up with an
idea like that while it's like,

50
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,860
well,
we thought about it for 7 million years 

51
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,350
and you know,
we got to the point where we could kind 

52
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,600
of act it out,
but we didn't know what we were doing,

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,480
but it was a emerge just like a dream.

54
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,480
It was.
So the terror of the future is a dream 

55
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,800
and his solution to the terror,
the dream of the terror of the future is

56
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,640
another dream.
And it,

57
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,780
it comes out in mythology and in fantasy
and in drama where you act out the 

58
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,360
sacrifice and then it's a step on the 
way to full understanding.

59
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,460
So we can say sacrifice instead of doing
it,

60
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,080
you know,
although we still do it,

61
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,450
it's just not concretized like it used 
to be.

62
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,280
We do abstractly and we all have faith 
that it will work,

63
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,830
you know,
and we also set up our society so that 

64
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:14,830
it'll work.
And one thing about,

65
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,160
you know,
I'm not a fan of moral relativism for a 

66
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,690
variety of reasons,
partly because I think it's an,

67
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,770
it's an extreme form of cowardice.
But anyways,

68
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,780
apart from that,
no,

69
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:26,440
no,
no,

70
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:28,360
no.
There's minimal ways that you can set up

71
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:31,230
a society that will work and so one of 
them is,

72
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:36,231
is that the society has to be set up so 
that your sacrifices will pay off or you

73
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,860
won't work,
and then the society will die.

74
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,250
And so it has to make promises.
People have to make promises to one 

75
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:44,250
another.
And that's what money is.

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,460
Money is a promise that your sacrifice 
will pay off in the future.

77
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,180
That's what money is.
And so if the society is stable,

78
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,360
you can store up your work right now.
You can sacrifice your impulses and you 

79
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:03,121
can work and you can store up credit for
the future and then you can make the 

80
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:08,401
future a better place,
but society has to be stable enough to 

81
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:09,910
allow for that.
Hyperinflation will do you in.

82
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,530
So the promise that's implicit in the 
currency is the promise that what you're

83
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:18,220
doing now will pay off in the future,
and if people don't have that promise,

84
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:21,790
then what?
We know what they do because in in gangs

85
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,130
for example,
and say gangs in North America,

86
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,610
the time horizon of the gang members 
shrinks rapidly because they don't 

87
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,100
really expect to be alive much past 21.

88
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,770
And so they get really impulsive and 
violent and like,

89
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:35,440
why the hell not?
That's what you do when,

90
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,860
when the future doesn't matter,
when it's not real,

91
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,190
you default back to living in the moment
and you take what you can get right now 

92
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,800
and no wonder because you don't know if 
you're going to be around in a in a year

93
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,220
and you get whatever you can.
Well you can bloody well get it and 

94
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,520
that's like anarchy that state.
And so you don't want to live in,

95
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,550
some people like to live in that state 
because they're really wired for that,

96
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,580
you know,
and so they're much more comfortable in 

97
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:02,580
those conditions.
They're,

98
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,890
they're kind of like warrior types,
I would say in some sense.

99
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:10,891
But you know,
for most people that's just where that 

100
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:12,040
stress will just do 10,
you know,

101
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,260
the stress of a life like that.
So.
