1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:05,100
You're trying to do well in the class 
and you get a bad grade.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,220
Okay,
so you're in this little frame.

3
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:09,960
You want to get a good grade that isn't 
happening.

4
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:11,640
He got a bad grade.
Okay,

5
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:15,420
what is it that's manifesting itself as 
the bad grade?

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,620
While you could say,
well,

7
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:18,900
it's a c minus on a piece of paper.
It's like,

8
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:20,340
well,
that's really.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,700
Know that that's the objective 
manifestation.

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,970
You got a piece of paper with a c minus 
the value free proposition is that 

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,550
you've been delivered a piece of paper 
with a curve on it.

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,720
A little negative side.
Well you say,

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,220
well,
that's what that is.

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,800
Well,
you know it's as dopey is thinking,

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,390
well,
here you got your failing grade.

16
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:42,000
You go into the lab and you weigh it on 
a scale.

17
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,250
Then you burn it and see what it was 
made of.

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:44,820
It's like,
well,

19
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,160
why did I get so upset about that?
It's just paper.

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,230
It's like,
no,

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,010
that's not just paper.
It's an entity that exists in a web of 

22
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,461
connections.
The fact that it signified by papers 

23
00:00:58,461 --> 00:00:58,461
almost completely irrelevant.
What is it?

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,520
The answer is you don't know,
and that's why when you pick it up,

25
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:07,521
you get this paralyzed,
sinking feeling because your limbic 

26
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:11,481
system is a lot smarter than your 
perceptual systems and your perceptual 

27
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:11,550
systems say,
well,

28
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:13,500
that's a piece of paper and your limbic 
system says,

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,200
Nah,
for sure dragon.

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,360
Right?
Right.

31
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:23,361
And so then you're sweating and then 
maybe you put it away and you go play 

32
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:26,040
video games because you know better the 
hypothetical dragon,

33
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:29,670
then the real dragon.
And so instead you pull out the piece of

34
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,140
paper maybe and you think,
okay,

35
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,480
why did I get this c minus?
Well that's a hell of a question,

36
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:36,840
isn't it?

37
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,290
It's like maybe you're stupid.
Well,

38
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:45,291
that could be,
or at least stupid compared to who you 

39
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:45,291
think you are.
Like that's,

40
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:45,420
that's the real horror that's lurking 
there,

41
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:45,780
right?
It's like,

42
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,040
oh,
I thought I was kind of smart.

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,400
That's a,
that's a proposition of the highest 

44
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,400
order.
I thought I was kind of smart.

45
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:52,920
So like,
yeah,

46
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:54,720
well what about this c minus?
It's like,

47
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,780
well that God damn professor,
right?

48
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,980
That's the first thing.
I've been attacked by a predator.

49
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:03,630
That's the first response,
right?

50
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:05,340
So it's,
it's a nonsensical message.

51
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:07,560
It's just delivered by someone evil in 
predatory.

52
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,400
Well that's,
you know,

53
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,150
possible.
But I wouldn't go there.

54
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,480
I wouldn't go there first necessarily.
So.

55
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,760
But then.
Well then say you don't go there.

56
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:18,270
Okay.
Well,

57
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:23,271
so what is this exactly?
Do you not know what you thought you 

58
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:24,930
knew?
What are you not who you think you are?

59
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,800
Do you don't work hard enough?
Are Your values not organized properly?

60
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:32,010
Do you misuse your time?
Are you in the wrong field?

61
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,790
Is the way you're construing Your Life 
Completely Inappropriate?

62
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:40,791
Are you acting out what your parents 
wanted you to do and you're pissed off 

63
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,941
about it?
So you're only running at 40 percent to 

64
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:44,430
spite them despite the fact that they're
paying $25,000

65
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,800
a year for your education because that's
a fun game.

66
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,020
Yeah,
I'll go do what you want me to do,

67
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:54,021
but I'll fail at,
but not completely because then that 

68
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:58,071
would cost you very much.
I'll just fail a little bit so that you 

69
00:02:58,071 --> 00:03:00,250
have to spend all that money forcing me 
to what I don't want to do,

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,580
but you'll never get to escape from it,
and then every time we interact,

71
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:06,460
I'll stab you in various ways that you 
don't quite understand,

72
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,640
just to show you how irritated I am that
I happened to be acting out the destiny 

73
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,010
that you've put forward for me.

74
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,280
So maybe that's part of the Dragon,
right?

75
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:19,281
And then that pulls in the whole parent 
thing and these are bottomless pits.

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,840
Often when you,
when you're in the world and something 

77
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,630
objects to you,
something that matters,

78
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,820
objects to you than the entire on 
realized world is in that thing that 

79
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,260
objects.
It's all tangled up inside.

80
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:34,600
If that's why it's the great dragon of 
chaos.

81
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,920
It's everything that's outside of your 
conceptual structure and what is that?

82
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,230
It's everything that lurks outside of 
your,

83
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,500
of your walled city,
and it's manifested itself like the 

84
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,230
snake in the garden and the easiest 
thing to do is say,

85
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,500
I'm not having anything to do with that,
but the problem with that is,

86
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,030
well,
you get your c minus and you don't do 

87
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,131
anything about it.
Maybe you're a little bitter and more 

88
00:03:59,131 --> 00:03:59,131
resentful and your study habits get a 
little worse.

89
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:03,270
So the next time you get like a d plus,
and then you collect a bunch of f's and 

90
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,560
then you stopped going to school.
Then you stop showering,

91
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,290
right?
Then you end up jumping off the bridge.

92
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,100
And so that's,
uh,

93
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,390
that's,
that's how the dragon eats you when you 

94
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,590
don't pay attention to it.
And so it's no bloody wonder that people

95
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:15,700
avoid,
you know,

96
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,940
it's really no wonder that they avoid 
because error messages contain within 

97
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,591
them the implicit world.
Now the upside of that is while they 

98
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:30,661
contain within them the implicit world 
and the world isn't all negative and so 

99
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:34,771
maybe you get your c minus and that's 
actually the best gift you ever got 

100
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:36,280
because somebody finally took you and 
went whack,

101
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,080
you know,
clue in.

102
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,000
And so you take that apart and you 
think,

103
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,020
oh,
I don't know how to write.

104
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
I don't know how to think.

105
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,120
I've never read anything in my life.
My study habits are abysmal.

106
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:51,121
You know,
like maybe I'm working at two percent 

107
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:51,121
efficiency,
which,

108
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:51,121
which is probably,
I would suspect that,

109
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:52,810
you know,
some of you aren't doing that,

110
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:57,811
but I bet you that I bet there's 30,
30 to 50 percent of the people in the 

111
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:59,350
room are working at two percent 
efficiency.

112
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,460
It's like you got it.
That.

113
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,500
So to find that out is so optimistic.
I mean if you're barely hanging in 

114
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,820
there,
but you're only working at two percent,

115
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:09,330
you might imagine what you could have as
a life if you work at,

116
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:11,950
at like 50 percent.
So,

117
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,220
so the,
the c minus can be the best gift you 

118
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:17,290
ever had and that's the gold that the 
dragon hordes,

119
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,940
right?
That's exactly what that means.

120
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,570
And so well,
so you're moving from point a to point 

121
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:24,570
b.

122
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,950
In your little circumscribed world,
you've made everything invisible and as 

123
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,100
long as that works,
then your theory is good enough.

124
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:31,720
It's accurate enough,
it's true enough,

125
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,500
you're in your little paradise.
But if something comes up and objects,

126
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,560
well that's where your character is 
tested.

127
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,750
Fundamentally,
that's the character test.

128
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:43,000
It's like what do you do with messages 
of error?

129
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,340
And that's a tricky issue.
Okay,

130
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:49,690
so here's the solution to that.
Here's what not to do.

131
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,210
I am a bad person.
I go to see my.

132
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,340
I'm a bad person.
I might as well just go jump off the 

133
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:57,340
bridge.
It's like,

134
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:57,340
no,
that's not good.

135
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,500
Because what means is that every time,
every time you try to learn something,

136
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:02,330
you're going to make a mistake because 
what do you know?

137
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,330
So you're going to make mistakes.
And if the rule is every time you make a

138
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,160
mistake,
you're going to go jump off the bridge,

139
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,850
then that's not a useful problem solving
strategy.

140
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,120
And so when you make a mistake,
you don't get to beat yourself to death 

141
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,780
with a club,
it's a bad strategy,

142
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:22,781
and you'll have your internal tyrant in 
there who's perfectly happy about doing 

143
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:26,351
that.
That's the overactive super ego that 

144
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:29,830
Freud talked about.
Maybe it came to you via a parent who 

145
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,390
was too authoritarian or a grandparent 
or a,

146
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,770
or maybe it's just you because you're 
disagreeable in neurotic.

147
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:36,170
And so you'll take your hyper 
conscientious.

148
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:38,270
You'll take yourself apart.
Well,

149
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,750
starting the so you've got a problem.
Something has objected to you.

150
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,090
Then the question is,
well,

151
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,110
what does that mean?
Well,

152
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:49,640
maybe you're not looking at the world,
right?

153
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,550
Maybe your goals are wrong.
Maybe you're not acting properly.

154
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,850
So okay,
so the question that arises when an 

155
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,641
obstacle emerges is which part of this 
structure needs attention?

156
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,990
And the first answer can't be all of it,
which is why when you're arguing with 

157
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:13,211
someone in an intimate relationship and 
you're angry at them and you want to 

158
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:14,210
win,
which is a big mistake,

159
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,590
you want to,
when you say,

160
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,980
well you're,
this is what you're like,

161
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
here's another 10 examples of how you've
done that in the past and I can 

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,000
enumerate more of them if you'd like.

163
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,110
And so it doesn't,
that's actually what you like and I've 

164
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,791
tried fixing you and didn't work.
And so it looks like you're going to be 

165
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:31,791
like that up into the future.
And you're basically saying to them,

166
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,930
well,
you're a bad person.

167
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,110
And the only thing they can do is either
collapse or punch you and punching you 

168
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,620
is actually better than collapsing.
Like you don't.

169
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:44,621
You know what I mean?
It's such a counterproductive way of 

170
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:44,621
arguing.
You don't leave the person handing out.

171
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:47,360
And so maybe while they're civilized so 
it doesn't get physical,

172
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:49,520
well maybe that's good and maybe it 
isn't.

173
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,760
But then they end up either really not 
happy with you in a way that they will 

174
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,971
manifest the first possible opportunity 
they get or they have to go off in the 

175
00:07:57,971 --> 00:07:57,980
corner and cringe.
It's like,

176
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,060
great,
you won.

177
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,000
It's like now your partners either hates
you or is cringing.

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,860
It's great.
That's a real good victory man.

179
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,540
Rack up about 100 victories like that.
And you'll be in divorce court and 

180
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,990
spending $250,000
while being miserable about it.

181
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,850
Yeah.
So anyway,

182
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:16,460
so something objects to you and you 
think,

183
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:17,270
okay,
well I need to,

184
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,000
I need to take myself apart.
Right?

185
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:23,060
Because there's a piece that's broken 
somewhere and then you might think,

186
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:28,061
well let's,
let's assume it's a little piece to 

187
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:28,061
begin with.
That's the right mechanism.

188
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:28,130
It's like,
okay,

189
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,340
you got a c minus that doesn't prove 
that you're stupid and now it implies 

190
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:36,260
that you might be stupid,
but it doesn't.

191
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:37,340
Right.
Really it does.

192
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:38,480
And that's why you don't want to look at
it.

193
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:43,481
Maybe it implies that you're lazier,
implies that you're ignorant or like it 

194
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,871
implies all sorts of terrible.
Might imply that you're a bad person 

195
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:50,171
even,
but you don't want to leap to that and 

196
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:50,480
that's sort of the proclamation of 
innocence before guilt.

197
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,910
Assume that you're the least amount of 
reprehensible and ignorant possible.

198
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,890
And so then you look at the micro 
routines.

199
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,500
So okay,
well I got a c minus in this course.

200
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,770
Maybe I should study for that course,
15 minutes more a day for the next three

201
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:09,660
months.
And then you ask yourself,

202
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:11,010
do you think you could do that?
No,

203
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm too useless.
Okay,

204
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,390
how about 15 minutes every second day 
you think you could do that?

205
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,570
You put it in your schedule like 15 
minutes every second day in the morning 

206
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,030
and that's why you think,
well,

207
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,650
what's wrong with me?
Well,

208
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm not very good at managing my study 
schedule.

209
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,960
That's not quite down here at the 
behavioral level,

210
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:30,990
but it's pretty close because what?
You can take an action,

211
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:32,700
you can open up your schedule and you 
can say,

212
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:34,890
Oh mark,
15 minutes away aside.

213
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:40,190
Then you can practice doing that.
It's pretty low level in the hierarchy 

214
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:40,830
means while you're still not a horrible 
person,

215
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,290
you just got to polish up your work 
ethic.
