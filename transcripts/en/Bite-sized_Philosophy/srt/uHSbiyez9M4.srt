1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,820
I'm doing one thing really stupidly that
I should stop doing.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,310
It's like,
how long are you going to take you to 

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:09,310
figure out what that is?
It's about two seconds,

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:09,940
right?
You've known it forever.

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,300
Then you could even make less demanding.
You could say,

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,200
there are some stupid things that I'm 
doing that I know are stupid and wrong 

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,430
that I could stop doing that I would 
stop doing,

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,580
and then you can just start with that 
and you can just do that and maybe it's 

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,220
just a little thing.
Although it's not because it's.

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:36,370
It's a.
it's a step forward on the proper 

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:36,370
voyage.
It's not a small thing and you think,

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,010
well,
what would happen?

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,280
You could say,
let's do this for a year or even a 

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,280
month.
Just try not to do things you know,

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,661
to be stupid and wrong for a month,
and that means not to say things you 

16
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:48,440
know to be stupid and wrong as well.
Maybe that's the most important thing.

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,470
Just do it as an experiment,
see what happens,

18
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:56,471
and it's so fun because I have people 
writing to me from all over the world 

19
00:00:56,471 --> 00:00:56,570
who are saying they're doing that.
They're saying,

20
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:57,380
well,
you know,

21
00:00:57,381 --> 00:01:02,381
I cleaned up my room and,
and then I stopped saying stupid things 

22
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:04,310
and my God,
it's like things are way better.

23
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,040
It's like who would have guessed it?
You know?

24
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,250
And so it's low hanging fruit ban 
because that's the other thing.

25
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:14,690
If there's a lot of things wrong with 
you,

26
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,880
then it's really easy to start fixing 
it.

27
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:18,200
You know,
he got so much.

28
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,720
There's so much territory that you can 
inhabit.

29
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,460
I will make of thee a great nation.
I will bless thee.

30
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,610
That's good.
I mean the whole nation thing that's 

31
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:30,610
positive,
but to have God on your side,

32
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,640
that's,
you know,

33
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,730
you might want that when things get 
rough,

34
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:39,200
that would be good and make that name 
great and thou shalt be a blessing.

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,890
Wonderful.
That's a good deal.

36
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,940
Then I will bless them that bless thee.
That's good too.

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,110
And curse him that curse thee and in 
these shall all families of the earth be

38
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:56,111
blessed.
That's something that's something that 

39
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:03,451
wouldn't be something if you could wake 
up and your day was composed in part of 

40
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:07,960
people thanking you for all the good 
things you've done in the world,

41
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,490
would that be good?

42
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,620
It's not impossible for that to happen.
So Abraham departed.

43
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,490
Yes.
As the Lord had spoken unto him and lot 

44
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,941
went with him and Abraham was 70 and 
five years when he departed out of her 

45
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:28,590
and that's old now.
Abraham lives a long time,

46
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:33,591
but this is also part of this story.
So he has a wife who can't have 

47
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:33,591
children.
He has nothing.

48
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:35,700
Obviously.
He's been hanging around dad's shack for

49
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:38,010
a little too long given that he's 75,
right?

50
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:43,011
It's time,
it's time to get to the fire lit 

51
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:44,430
underneath and the bath.
And so these not got much going for him,

52
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,550
but he still decides to move forward.
And I've seen this too,

53
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:52,551
you know,
like if you don't have your destiny in 

54
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:52,740
hand by your time you're 30,
it's rough.

55
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,370
You start hurting and if you don't have 
your destiny in hand by the time you're 

56
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,551
40 then you really start hurting.
And 40 is a real fork in the road,

57
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,660
the fork in the road.
That's always where you meet the devil 

58
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,821
by the way.
And that's because every time you have 

59
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:14,730
to make a decision,
the possibility of evil beckons.

60
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:16,620
That's why that is.
I had a friend,

61
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:20,690
I've told you a little about him and he 
killed himself just after 40 know he had

62
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,130
had a book published hitting him with a 
very small press.

63
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:28,131
He was quite a good writer,
but he could not get himself together 

64
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:30,060
and it hit him too hard at 40.
And I'm not saying that it's hopeless at

65
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:35,061
40.
I'm not saying that and I'm not saying 

66
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:37,731
that partly because of these verses,
but also partly because of what I've 

67
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:40,401
seen in my clinical practice.
I've had people come to me who have had 

68
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:41,940
very chaotic and ill spent lives,
let's say,

69
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,030
who were in that neighborhood of age 
and.

70
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,760
And it's true for people who are older 
as well,

71
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,630
who then decided to make a real effort 
and to try to make where they were 

72
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,090
better.
You know,

73
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:56,070
instead of being bitter about where they
weren't.

74
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,490
Because

75
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,110
that's the bitterness that really does 
you,

76
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,620
when it's really not good.
It's the opposite of gratitude.

77
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,490
It's,
it's,

78
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:06,160
it's the manifestation of resentment.
It makes you malevolent.

79
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,930
It's very,
very bad to be better.

80
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,490
It's not,
it's not.

81
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,960
It's hell to be bitter,
and if you're 40 and you're not 

82
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,340
successful,
then you have to accept your lot and you

83
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,920
have to start to improve what's right in
front of you.

84
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,810
And if you do that,
it doesn't take very long.

85
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:26,560
It's quite interesting to watch people.
Things can be a lot better in six months

86
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:29,290
and they can be way better in two years.
Like it's a struggle,

87
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,830
uphill struggle,
but it's by no means impossible.

88
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,960
And I don't know again what the limit of
that is.

89
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:38,560
I suppose it depends to a degree to some
degree on the degree of your commitment,

90
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,700
but anyway,
so aber,

91
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:43,360
it's another indication of the real 
validity of this story.

92
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,060
God isn't setting this up to be easy,
right?

93
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,040
Abraham was old and he and and his and 
his wife is old to and more than that,

94
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:56,041
she's barren.
How is he going to be the father of 

95
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:56,041
nations?
How is he going to be successful?

96
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,960
Well,
the initial departure point is 

97
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,620
insufficient,
radically insufficient,

98
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,830
and that's very inspiring because it 
means that you can start from where you 

99
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:10,480
are.
