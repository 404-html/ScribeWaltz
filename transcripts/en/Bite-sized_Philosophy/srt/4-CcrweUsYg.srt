1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,150
People have a lot of guilt,
you know,

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:08,151
there there's a line of social 
psychology that claims that most people 

3
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:09,960
feel that they're better than other 
people and like I just don't buy that,

4
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:14,961
that isn't what I've seen in my life and
maybe I'm a bit biased because I'm a 

5
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:18,381
clinical psychologist and I see more 
people who are overtly suffering maybe 

6
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:21,120
than people do in general.
Although I'm not so sure about that,

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:26,121
you know,
because you don't have to scratch very 

8
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:28,221
far beneath the surface of most people's
lives before you find something truly 

9
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:32,511
tragic.
And I don't mean this sort of tragedy 

10
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:32,511
that you whine about.
I mean,

11
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:33,740
you know,
your mother has Alzheimer's or,

12
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:38,741
or your,
your best friend committed suicide or 

13
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:39,720
you have a close relative with cancer.
You have a sick child or you know,

14
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:44,721
there's something wrong with you because
almost everyone has at least one really 

15
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:45,090
terrible thing wrong with them.

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,710
And if you don't,
hey you will.

17
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:47,310
So,
you know,

18
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,300
so that,
so,

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,420
so that,
that depth tragic sense of being is 

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,230
there with people all the time.
And it's also the case that,

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,900
that in my experience,
like I rarely meet someone who says,

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,680
Hey,
you know,

23
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,490
I'm doing everything I possibly can.
I'm a hell of a guy and I can't see how 

24
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,950
I could possibly improve.
You know,

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,030
you meet,
you meet someone like that.

26
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,660
You think they're narcissistic,
right?

27
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,530
Would endure,
right.

28
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,670
And,
but,

29
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,330
but most people don't feel that way.
They feel like they could do a hell of a

30
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:23,331
lot better than they are and they're 
quite acutely aware of their faults and 

31
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:24,540
they don't feel that they are what they 
should be.

32
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,320
And you see what happens in the story of
Adam and Eve as well as that.

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,920
When people become self conscious,
at least that's how it looks to me.

34
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,010
They get thrown out of paradise and then
they're in history.

35
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:40,011
And history is a place where there's 
pain in childbirth and where you're 

36
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:42,300
dominated by your mate and where you 
have to toil like mad,

37
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:44,940
like no other animal because you're 
aware of the future.

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,060
You have to work and sacrifice the joys 
of the present for the future 

39
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,660
constantly.
And you know you're going to die and you

40
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:53,670
have all that weight on you.
And to me,

41
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:58,671
again,
that's just how can anything be more 

42
00:01:58,671 --> 00:01:59,190
true than not.
That's just as far as I can tell.

43
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:04,191
That's just how it is for.
Unless you're naive beyond 

44
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,590
comprehension,
there's something about your life that,

45
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,430
that,
that is echoed in,

46
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:13,431
in that representation and why it is 
that mean we're such strange creatures 

47
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:16,890
because we don't seem to really fit into
being in some sense.

48
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:19,770
And that's also what's expressed in the 
notion of the fall.

49
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,390
We,
the existentialist said,

50
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:26,391
well,
people feel like they have a debt that 

51
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:26,391
they have to pay off to existence for 
the,

52
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:31,210
for the crime of there,
for the crime of there being something 

53
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,031
like that.
And maybe it's because we're acutely 

54
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:37,281
aware that we have to offer something of
value to the people around us so that 

55
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:37,520
they can tolerate us.
You know,

56
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,210
well we're,
we're going about our business.

57
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:44,211
But it seems deeper than that is that 
human beings seem to exist in a post 

58
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:49,911
cataclysmic world.
And that's exactly also what's 

59
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:52,851
represented in genesis.
And it's very interesting because you 

60
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:52,851
know,
there's,

61
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:53,820
in the Adam and Eve story,
there's two,

62
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,510
there's two catastrophes.
Essentially there's the catastrophe that

63
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:02,511
occurs when Adam and eve wake up,
which we'll talk about in detail and 

64
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:03,370
become self conscious and,
and know that they're naked,

65
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,770
that and their eyes are open,
right?

66
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,720
So that's the terminology that's used.
And to have your eyes open means to have

67
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:12,250
an,
an increment in consciousness.

68
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:17,251
Essentially [inaudible] eyes are 
associated with consciousness for human 

69
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:17,410
beings because we're intensely visual 
animals.

70
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,650
And so the metaphor of having your eyes 
opened means it's the same as the 

71
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,271
metaphor of coming to consciousness.
And as soon as Adam and eve come to 

72
00:03:27,271 --> 00:03:27,271
consciousness,
they realized they're naked.

73
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,370
And you know,
the classic interpretation of that is 

74
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:32,440
that it has something to do with sexual 
sin.

75
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,890
And I don't,
I don't believe that I,

76
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:36,730
I don't believe that that's what it 
means.

77
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:39,400
All the other elements about that that 
are irrelevant,

78
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,860
it's more of that to realize that you're
naked.

79
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,510
It's like you're,
you know,

80
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,690
if you dream that you're naked on a 
stage in front of people,

81
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,750
that's not a sexual dream man.
Unless you're some kind of strange 

82
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,750
exhibitionist,
right?

83
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,590
It's,
it's you want to cover yourself up and 

84
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,561
get the hell off that stage as fast as 
possible and so it'll be naked in front 

85
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:02,341
of a crowd is to have everyone.
It's to have the judgment of the social 

86
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:07,351
world focused on your self evident 
inadequacies and that makes people self 

87
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:11,320
conscious and that that's a real human 
state.

88
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:14,620
It's associated with neuroticism and in 
the big five traits model,

89
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:19,621
but people don't like that at all.
They don't like having their fragility 

90
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:24,241
and vulnerability exposed to the group.
It's one of the two major fears of 

91
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:28,111
people because one is social humiliation
and the other is something like 

92
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:32,041
mortality and death and like your.
Your typical agoraphobic for example,

93
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,410
gets to have both those fears at the 
same time because she usually is.

94
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:40,411
She Ken's to believe she's going to have
a very spectacular and exhibition mystic

95
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:45,721
heart attack in a public place and make 
a terrible fool of herself while she's 

96
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:46,270
dying.
So,

97
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,220
and then that's a good example of the 
two archetipal fears that characterize,

98
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,630
characterize human beings.
