1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
Why don't the feminist complain about 
Saudi Arabia?

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,810
It's like,

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,910
you know,
Gad Saad,

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,920
who's this guy at Concordia who is in a 
business school so he can actually say 

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,270
what he thinks now and then he tweeted 
yesterday,

6
00:00:19,271 --> 00:00:22,180
well he tweeted to the woman's march,
you know,

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,240
because there's little twitter thing you
could do that I suppose for the 

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,240
organizers.
And he said,

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,900
why don't you go to the Middle East and 
have a nice march again,

10
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:31,950
Saudi Arabia and see,
see how that works out for ya?

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,270
Like,
so you think,

12
00:00:34,271 --> 00:00:35,870
well why not?
Like,

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,790
why not?
Why?

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,050
Why are the why or the radical leftists 
who are so much for rights everywhere.

15
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:46,051
That's what they say.
Why aren't they complaining about Saudi 

16
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:46,051
Arabia,
for example,

17
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:50,310
which you know,
breeds a particularly pathological form 

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,780
of ideologically rigid his lap basically
in slaves.

19
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:55,210
They're women.
That's to put it properly.

20
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,070
It's like,
why not complaining about that?

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,270
Well,
how about this?

22
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,660
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
And so when push comes to shove,

23
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,970
you see how much concern there is among 
the radical feminists for the rights of 

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,100
women.
It's like if,

25
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,220
if the pushing those rights forward 
doesn't also at the same time under a 

26
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,590
undermine the western patriarchy,
then we'll take the undermining and 

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,521
leave the damn rights behind,
and so there's an insight for you about 

28
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:25,210
exactly what's going on at the bottom of
all this.
