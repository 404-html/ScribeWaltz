1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,400
I've,
I've been telling people online in 

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,911
various ways and in lectures that they 
should start fixing up the world by 

3
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:11,690
cleaning up their room and I want it to 
just elaborate on that a little bit 

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,111
before I get back to the lecture itself.
So I'd say it's become this Internet 

5
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:17,280
weird Internet meme,
you know,

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,810
and,
and,

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,990
and,
and it's a joke and good.

8
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:26,991
It's a jewel.
I really happy about the fact that so 

9
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:29,871
much of this has got like the leaving of
humor and it's really important because 

10
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:31,140
that's what stops things from 
degenerating into,

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,650
into conflict humor.
And I was thinking about this idea of 

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,491
cleaning up your room in relationship to
the mustard seed idea and you see the 

13
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:44,421
thing about cleaning up your room.
This is also something I learned from 

14
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:46,800
Carl young and his studies on alchemy 
because for young,

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,010
when the alchemist was attempting to 
make the philosopher's stone,

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,070
he was not only engaged in the 
transformation of the material world,

17
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:58,050
but he was engaged in a process of self 
transformation that occurred at the same

18
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,780
time as the,
as the chemical Trent,

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,470
as the chemical transformation.

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,480
So it was a psychological work in some 
sense.

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Let's say you want to sort out your room
and beautified because the beauty is 

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,201
also important and let's say that all 
you have is just a little room like 

23
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:15,411
you're not rich,
you're poor and you don't have any 

24
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:15,411
power.
That's another thing,

25
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:17,610
but you've got your damn room and you've
got this space right in front of you.

26
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:22,611
You know that,
that that's a part of the cosmos that 

27
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:22,890
you can come to grips with and you might
think,

28
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:27,891
well,
what's there in front of you right in 

29
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:27,891
front of you?
And the answer to that is,

30
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:31,371
it depends on how open your eyes are,
that that's the proper answer because 

31
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:32,700
you could say,
w William Blake said this,

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,730
for example,
Elvis Huxley made comments that were 

33
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:37,730
very similar that in a transcendent 
state,

34
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,410
you can see infinity in the finite and 
you might say,

35
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:41,040
well,
you can say,

36
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,550
and you can see infinity in what you 
have within your grasp.

37
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,400
If you look and you could save,
maybe that's the case with your room,

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,640
and so you want to clean up your room.
Well,

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,170
okay,
how do you do that?

40
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,550
Exactly?
Well,

41
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:58,551
a room,
his room is a place to sleep and so if 

42
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:02,001
you set your room up properly,
then you figure out how to sleep and 

43
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:04,761
when you should sleep and how you should
sleep and then you figure out when you 

44
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:08,331
should wake up and then you figure out,
well what clothes you should wear 

45
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:10,851
because they have to be arranged 
properly in your dresser and then you 

46
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:10,851
have to have some place to put your 
clothes and if you're going to have some

47
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:15,741
clothes,
you have to figure out what you're 

48
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:15,741
gonna.
Wear those clothes to do.

49
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:18,830
Right,
and then that means you got to figure 

50
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,391
out what you're going to do and then 
your room has to serve that purpose 

51
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:20,640
because otherwise it isn't set up 
properly.

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,660
And if it doesn't set up,
if it doesn't serve your purposes,

53
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,390
you will be unhappy and not happy in the
room.

54
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:32,391
Because the way that we perceive the 
world is as a place to move from point a

55
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:37,821
to point B in.
And then if the place that we're in 

56
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:39,570
facilitates that movement,
then we're happy to be there.

57
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,650
And if the place that we're in serves as
an obstacle to that movement,

58
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:47,490
then we're unhappy to be there.
And so what it means to set up your room

59
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:50,520
is that you have to have somewhere to go
that's worthwhile,

60
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:55,521
or you can set up your room and your 
room has to be set up to facilitate 

61
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:55,980
that.
And then the next thing is,

62
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:57,750
well,
maybe you have to make it beautiful,

63
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,070
but that's not easy,
right?

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Means you have to have some taste.
And that doesn't mean you have to have 

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,200
money.

66
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,220
It doesn't.
Because you can be garish with money and

67
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:11,221
you can be tasteful with nothing.
All you need is taste and taste beats 

68
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:12,280
money.
When it comes to beautifying things,

69
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,320
you know,
I mean not that money is trivial because

70
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:19,321
it's not.
But taste is crucial and people who are 

71
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:21,961
very artistically oriented can make 
beautiful things out of virtually 

72
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:22,150
nothing.
And not only that,

73
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:25,300
the literature suggests that if you're 
going to make beautiful things,

74
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,750
putting real constraints on,
on what you allow yourself to do,

75
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,780
facilitates creativity instead of 
interfering with it.

76
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,780
Because let's say you have to make 
something out of nothing,

77
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,390
right?
Which I suppose would be a Godly Act,

78
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:42,391
right?
You have to make something out of 

79
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:44,221
nothing.
You have to be creative in order to do 

80
00:03:44,221 --> 00:03:46,561
that and so then to to beautify your 
room means that you also have to develop

81
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:51,691
your capacity to be creative and so then
you can make your room shine,

82
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,150
but then what will happen is that if 
your family isn't together,

83
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,440
they will interfere with that.

84
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,530
You will interfere with that because you
won't have the discipline to do it 

85
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:01,950
properly,
but then when you start building this,

86
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,530
this,
this little microcosm of perfection with

87
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:10,531
what you have at hand and it'll evoke 
all the pathologies of everyone in your 

88
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:11,680
household.
The wonder what the hell you're up to in

89
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:14,980
there and they won't necessarily be 
happy because if you're.

90
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,200
If they're in a lowly place,
let's say,

91
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:19,240
and so are you and you're trying to move
out of that,

92
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,460
then the higher you move out of that,
the more the place they're in looks bad 

93
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,060
and you might say,
well,

94
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:28,540
what they should do is celebrate your 
victory over chaos and evil,

95
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:33,541
but that isn't what will happen.
What will happen instead is that they 

96
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,240
will attempt to pull you back down.
They'll attempt to,

97
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,940
and I mean obviously all families don't 
do that,

98
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:41,941
but,
but all families do that to some degree 

99
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:42,790
and some families do almost nothing but 
that.

100
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,690
And so what that means is that if you're
going to organize your room,

101
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,780
then you're going to have to confront 
the devils in your house.

102
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:54,781
And that's often,
that's often a terrifying thing because 

103
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:56,350
some of those devils have,
have lineages that go back many,

104
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:59,230
many,
many generations and God only knows what

105
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:01,600
you have to struggle with in order to 
overcome that.

106
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:07,170
And so and then and so to sort yourself 
out into fix up your room is a 

107
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,260
nontrivial matter.
You know,

108
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,920
and you can do that.
You'll learn by doing that.

109
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:16,921
And then maybe you'll learn enough by 
doing that so that you can fix up your 

110
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:17,260
family a little bit.
And then having done that,

111
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:22,261
you'll have enough character so that 
when you try to operate in the world at 

112
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:23,680
your job,
or maybe in the broader social spheres,

113
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,080
that you will be a force for good 
instead of harm.

114
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:29,890
Because you will have learned some 
humility by noting just how difficult it

115
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:33,700
was to put your damn room together well 
and yourself for that matter.

116
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:38,140
And so you'll proceed cautiously with 
your eyes open towards the good.
