1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,880
Ideologies are fragmented,
religions are essentially,

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:04,610
they use the same symbolic under 
structured,

3
00:00:04,611 --> 00:00:07,320
but they only tell part of the story.
I can give you a quick example of that.

4
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:10,950
I'll do it very quickly.
So when the American West was settled,

5
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:14,280
it was settled on the.
On the wave of an ideological story,

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,670
and here's the story.
Heroic individual that's positive,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
bringing positive culture.
That's the wise king into virgin 

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,550
oriented,
chaotic territory.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,470
That's the negative mother essentially.
So that's positive individual,

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,510
positive culture,
negative nature,

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,270
right,
and that's.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,180
That's a motivating story,
man.

13
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:37,080
To bring heroically,
bring order into the untamed wilderness.

14
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,600
It's like a million people a year from 
Europe.

15
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,660
Come driven by that narrative.
It's,

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,230
okay,
well here's the counter narrative raping

17
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:51,231
and pillaging individual bringing the 
desolations of tyrannical culture into 

18
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:55,650
the virginal,
wonderful environmental.

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:56,860
What?
What?

20
00:00:56,861 --> 00:00:59,790
What would you call it?
A hystopia of nature.

21
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,290
It's like,
yeah man,

22
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,790
you can get a long way with that story 
too,

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,120
but they're both half the story,
so you just put those two things 

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,120
together and you have a religious story.

25
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,910
It's like while the individual is heroic
but also is an adversary and accrual 

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,020
adversary at that culture is the wise 
king,

27
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:19,710
but it's also the evil tyrant and nature
is beautiful and wonderful friendship,

28
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:24,711
impressionistic landscape and cancer and
anopheles mosquitoes and they 

29
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:27,540
elephantiasis and so if you are properly
oriented in the world,

30
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,280
you tell yourself both those stories and
you say,

31
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:30,570
Oh my God,
they conflict.

32
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:31,200
It's like,
yeah,

33
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:32,010
they do,
man.

34
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:37,011
That's exactly right.
So an etiology just pulls out a subset 

35
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:39,900
of the religious characters and says,
this is the entire reality.

36
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,440
It's like,
no,

37
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,240
it's not.
It's a parasitical.

38
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,750
It's a parasitical meme.
Essentially an ideology is a parasitical

39
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:47,280
meme on a religious substructure.
