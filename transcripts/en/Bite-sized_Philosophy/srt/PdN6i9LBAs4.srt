1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,400
I think I'm going to answer where do you
fall short in these 12 rules?

2
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:08,620
Is it a cost constant adjustment?
You know what?

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,470
I wrote these rules.
What you mean?

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,300
Why did I write these rules?
Well,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,590
you know,

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,350
and especially when I said,
well,

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:23,351
you should try to improve yourself 
instead of trying to set the world 

8
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:23,870
straight or instead of worrying about 
what other people are doing wrong,

9
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:28,871
you might say,
well that's a hell of a thing for 

10
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:30,251
someone to say,
you just wrote a book called 12 rules 

11
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:30,251
for lights.
It's like,

12
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:33,630
no,
but the thing is is that I wasn't just 

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,720
writing that.
I was reading that for me as much as for

14
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:39,410
anyone else and I mean that's.
I really mean that sincerely.

15
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:44,411
You know,
I had an opportunity to spend somewhere 

16
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,291
around five years meditating on how you 
should conduct yourself so that your 

17
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,660
life is what it could be.
And like I'm in the group of people that

18
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:52,460
I'm advising you.
You know what I mean?

19
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:57,461
It's like all of these things are very 
difficult to stand up straight to 

20
00:00:57,461 --> 00:01:00,851
remember that and to treat yourself like
you're someone worthwhile and to make 

21
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:04,640
friends with people who are good for you
and to tell the truth or at least not to

22
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:04,970
lie.

23
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,590
I mean these are all ideals,
right,

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,610
and especially taken as a whole.
They constituted a kind of ideal and you

25
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:11,960
never.
You never.

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,410
You never attained the ideal,
the eye,

27
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,760
and not only that,
it recedes as you approach it,

28
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:21,761
right?
Because you straighten yourself out and 

29
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:21,761
you think,
well,

30
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:21,761
I've got it now and you think,
no,

31
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:21,761
wait a minute.
There's more to gold.

32
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:24,320
There's still more to go,
and then you get that much farther along

33
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:25,250
the line you think,
cool,

34
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,650
yeah,
I thought this was the end of the road.

35
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:28,400
It's like,
no,

36
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,300
there's plenty of imperfections left to 
iron out,

37
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:37,330
and so it is a constant adjustment and.
But there's something about that that's 

38
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,231
also positive because you might say that
it's not so much that there isn't such a

39
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:46,751
thing as a good person.
It's that our idea of what constitutes 

40
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:50,471
good isn't right,
because a good person is someone who's 

41
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:53,660
trying to get better and no matter how 
good you are,

42
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,100
there's better that you can get,
but the real goodness is in the attempt,

43
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,100
right?
It's in.

44
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,210
It's in the process too.
To use somewhat of a Cliche,

45
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,650
you know,
there's this,

46
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,090
oh,
and I'll close with this,

47
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,100
and it's a good way to close.
You know,

48
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,770
and this is a psychological observation.
The,

49
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,130
the central figure of Western culture is
Christ.

50
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,700
And we can look at that psychologically 
because Christ is the dying and 

51
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,940
resurrected hero.
And what does that mean psychologically?

52
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,860
Well,
it means that

53
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,580
you've learned things painfully,
and when you learn something painfully a

54
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:34,300
part of you has to die.
That's the pain.

55
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,340
You know,
when a dream is shattered,

56
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:38,510
for example,
a huge part of you that,

57
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:43,570
that constituted that dream.
Maybe even the biological substrate of 

58
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,660
that June has to be stripped away in and
burned.

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,680
And so life is a constant process of 
death and rebirth.

60
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,850
And to participate in that fully is to 
allow yourself to be redeemed by it.

61
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,950
And so the good is that process of death
and rebirth voluntarily undertaken.

62
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,050
It's like you're not as good as you 
could be.

63
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:11,050
So he let that part of you die.
And if someone comes along and says,

64
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,380
you know,
there's some deadwood here,

65
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,180
man,
it needs to be burned off.

66
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:16,660
You think,
well,

67
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,060
that stuff's still a bit alive when that
Burns,

68
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:20,410
it's going to hurt.
It's like,

69
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:22,360
yeah,
well no kidding.

70
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,990
But maybe the thing that emerges in its 
place is something better.

71
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,690
And I think this is the secret of human 
beings.

72
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,010
This is what we're like,
you know,

73
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:35,011
unlike any other creature is that we can
let our old selves die and let our new 

74
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:38,770
selves be bored.
And that's what we should do.

75
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,830
And so where do I fall short in these 12
rules?

76
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:47,020
Well,
endlessly because.

77
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Well,
here's a way of thinking about it until 

78
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,440
the entire world is redeemed.
We all fall short.

79
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,750
And that's probably a good place to 
stop.

80
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,530
Thanks.
