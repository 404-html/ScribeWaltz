1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,710
One of the things you pointed out too 
was that what you most need to know will

2
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:09,711
be found where you least want to look 
and that's because you haven't already 

3
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:11,910
looked there and so it's a little 
different for everyone,

4
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:14,010
right?
Because your particular place you'd want

5
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:16,050
to look isn't going to be the same as 
your place,

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,380
but you're going to have a place you 
don't want to look and what you haven't 

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,801
discovered.
That's where it is and so that's all 

8
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:26,670
partly going to be discovered by you 
looking at what you're capable of,

9
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:31,671
what you're truly capable of,
and you know people especially on the 

10
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:32,550
compassionate and saying,
well,

11
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:37,551
no,
I could never be like brutal like that 

12
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:40,401
and that could be true,
but you can kill people with compassion 

13
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:40,401
and no problem.
It happens.

14
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:44,330
That's the Freudian eatable situation.
So think about working in a nursing 

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:44,330
home.

16
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:49,190
So there's actually a rule of thumb,
which I also use to guide my 

17
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,800
interactions with children and also with
my clients.

18
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:54,801
And I would say with people in general 
do not do anything for anyone that they 

19
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:57,660
can do themselves.
All you do is steal you.

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,720
Just steal it from them.
So imagine you're working with really 

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:02,720
elderly people,
you know they have Alzheimer's.

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,490
It's like really easy to do things for 
them because while it isn't,

23
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,520
because it's really a hard job,
but it might be easier to do something 

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,270
for them then to let them struggle 
through it,

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,760
but you just speed their device.
Right.

26
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:19,761
By taking away the last vestiges of 
their independence and you do the same 

27
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:20,610
thing with kids.
It's like struggle through it.

28
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:23,100
Man.
Did you ever see my left foot?

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,450
That's a great movie.
It's about this author whose name 

30
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:29,450
escapes me at the moment.

31
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,950
Brilliant.
It's brilliant movie and the person who 

32
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,740
who played the part is Daniel Day Lewis.
I think he went to academy award for it,

33
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:40,770
but it's about this author in Ireland 
who was.

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,510
I think he had cerebral palsy and all he
could really do was use his left foot.

35
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,570
That was it.
The rest of him was pretty spastic and 

36
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:50,570
not in,
not controllable,

37
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,140
but he was there.
He was very intelligent.

38
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:54,840
He was with it and his dad would not 
help him.

39
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,650
He had to drag himself up the damn 
stairs with his left foot.

40
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,710
He just would not help him.
And what happened was he learned how to 

41
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:03,710
live,
you know,

42
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,540
he actually,
he couldn't function and the movie does 

43
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,991
the book which is called my left foot 
and the movie does a lovely job of 

44
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:15,681
laying that out,
but you have to be one hard hearted son 

45
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:18,171
of a bitch to let your sudden crawl up 
the stairs with his left foot over and 

46
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,290
over.
You think about that,

47
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,720
but what's the alternative?
You know,

48
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,930
if he would have been,
and of course he lays this out in the 

49
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:26,930
book,
if he would have been catered to,

50
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,110
he would have ended up just like you'd 
expect someone who is always catered to.

51
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,660
So it's a very nice lesson in the 
triumph of fostering independence over 

52
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:45,120
the,
over to casual compassion.

53
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,230
That's what I would say.
