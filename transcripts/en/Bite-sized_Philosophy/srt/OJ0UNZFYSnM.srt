1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,710
So when you know,
if you watch yourself,

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:07,711
you say,
well I had a particularly good day at 

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:07,711
work and what does that mean?
Well,

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,810
it means that you lost your sense of 
time,

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,800
right?
Because when you're having not a good 

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:16,840
day at work,
it's like first it's one minute to three

7
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:17,470
and then it's

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,300
45 seconds to three and then it's 30 
seconds.

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,980
That's what school was like.
For me,

10
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:28,981
it was like click.
So funny.

11
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:30,580
You know,
I went to,

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,170
I went to my daughter's school,
I used to get in trouble for talking all

13
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:39,850
the time,
surprise surprise when I was a kid and I

14
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:44,851
was bored stiff in school and so I would
misbehave upon occasion out of pure 

15
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:51,151
boredom.
And about 21 years ago I went to my 

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,690
daughter's school to sit for a class.
It was about an hour long and I was 

17
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:05,191
sitting there and the teacher had all 
the kids on the floor and was having 

18
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:09,360
some of the kids read to the others.
And some of the kids who were reading 

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,751
couldn't read at all.
And I had exactly the same experience I 

20
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:15,340
was sitting there.
It was like being like being seven years

21
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,810
old again and I could see the clock 
going,

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,880
tick,
tick,

23
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,020
and I thought,
you know,

24
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:23,700
if I was in this classroom for three 
days,

25
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,820
I would misbehave,
fit 40 years old,

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I would misbehave exactly like I did 
when I was when I was six.

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,020
No.
Well,

28
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:35,990
that's no place to be right because 
that's.

29
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,520
You don't want to be in a place that's 
stultifying.

30
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:40,290
You don't want to be in a place where 
there's no challenge.

31
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,420
You might even quit your job if there's 
no challenge.

32
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,890
Say,
well that's a good job.

33
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:45,510
It gives you security and you think,
God,

34
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:47,640
I can't stand this.
It's eating away at my soul.

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,270
It's all security and no challenge.
So why do you want to challenge?

36
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,750
Because that's what you're built for.
That's what you're built for your built 

37
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,380
to take on a maximal load,
right?

38
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:03,381
Because that's what strengthens you and 
you need to be strong because life is 

39
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,910
extraordinarily difficult and because 
the evil king is always widdling away at

40
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:10,911
the structure of the state and you have 
to be awake and sharp to stop that from 

41
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:14,481
happening so that you don't become 
corrupt and so that your family doesn't 

42
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,310
become corrupt and so that your state 
doesn't have to be come become corrupt.

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,520
You have to have your eyes open and your
which sharp and your words at the ready 

44
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,150
and you have to be educated and you have
to know about your history and you know 

45
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,690
how have to know how to think and you 
have to know how to read and you have to

46
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:31,590
know how to speak and you have to know 
how to aim and you have to be willing to

47
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:34,170
hoist the troubles of the world up on 
your shoulders.

48
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,410
And what's so interesting about that?
So remarkable.

49
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,470
And this is something that's really 
manifested itself to me as I've been 

50
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,221
doing these public lectures.
I've been talking about responsibility 

51
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:49,071
to people,
which doesn't seem to happen very often 

52
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:49,140
anymore.
And the audiences are dead quiet.

53
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,880
And I lay out this idea that life is 
tragedy tainted by malevolence,

54
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:55,080
and everyone says,
yeah,

55
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:59,040
well we already always suspected that no
one has ever said it quite so bluntly,

56
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,140
and it's quite a relief to hear that I'm
not the only person who has those 

57
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,140
suspicions.

58
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,910
And then the second part of that is the 
better part,

59
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:11,911
and it's the optimistic part,
which is despite the fact that life is a

60
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:16,360
tragedy tainted by malevolence at every 
level of existence,

61
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,600
there's something about the human spirit
that can thrive under precisely those 

62
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,281
conditions if we allow that to occur.
Because as difficult as life is and as 

63
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:31,171
horrible as we are,
our capacity to deal with that 

64
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:35,640
catastrophe and to transcend that 
malevolent spirit is more powerful than 

65
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:40,330
the that reality itself.
And that's the fundamental issue.

66
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,540
I think that's the fundamental issue of 
the Judaeo Christian ethic with its 

67
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,230
emphasis on the divinity of the 
individual.

68
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,360
As catastrophic as life is and his 
malevolent as people can be.

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,480
And that's malevolent beyond belief.
Fundamentally the person has in spirit 

70
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:05,251
the nobility to set that right and to 
defeat evil and that and that.

71
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,730
More than that and that the antidote to 
the catastrophe of life and the 

72
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,470
suffering of life and the tragedy of 
life that can drive you down and destroy

73
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:19,471
you,
is to take on exactly that 

74
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:19,471
responsibility and to say,
well,

75
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:24,330
there's plenty of work to be done and 
isn't that terrible and there isn't 

76
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,441
anything so bad that we can't make it 
worse and certainly try very hard to do 

77
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:33,631
so,
but I have it within me to decide that 

78
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:33,940
I'm going to stand up against that.

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,010
I'm going to strive to make the world a 
better place.

80
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,220
I'm going to strive to constrain the 
malevolence that's in my own heart and 

81
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,061
to set my family's straight and to work 
to work despite my tragic lot,

82
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,060
for the betterment of anything,
of everything that's in front of me.

83
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,210
And the consequence of that,
the immediate consequences of that is 

84
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,790
that when you make the decision to take 
on all of that voluntarily,

85
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,160
which is to stand up straight,
by the way,

86
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,500
with your shoulders back,
to take on that,

87
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,220
all that on voluntarily.
As soon as you make that decision,

88
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,830
then all the catastrophe justifies 
itself.

89
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,950
In the nobility of your striving,
and that's what it means to be an 

90
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:16,580
individual thing.

91
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,110
Thank you.
