1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,210
The sacrifice of the mother is 
exemplified profoundly by Michelangelo's

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,510
sculpture.
That Pie Ada,

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,660
Mary is Contemplating Her son crucified 
in ruins,

4
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:13,580
so that's his body after he's being 
crucified.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,680
It's her fault.
It was through her.

6
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:19,040
He entered the great drama of being.
So what's the meaning of this sculpture?

7
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:24,041
It's a great sculpture.
It's just an absolutely unbelievable 

8
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:27,221
sculpture.
You just can't believe that someone 

9
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:30,280
could exist who could make something up.
Of course it wasn't the only thing 

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,280
Michelangelo made,
right?

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,890
It wasn't like that's it.
It was something he just tossed off in a

12
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:36,680
couple of months while he was doing 
other unbelievable things,

13
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:39,700
but you know,
it's,

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,740
it's an.
It's an object of contemplation,

15
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,840
which is why it's integrate cathedral,
integrate city.

16
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:47,380
It's an object of contemplation and the 
idea is something like,

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,390
what,
what?

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,080
What's the role of a mother if she's 
awake.

19
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,020
I had a client come to see me a while 
back,

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,080
not very long ago,
woman in about who's about 30 and trying

21
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:06,461
to make decisions about her life.
She was pretty career oriented and so I 

22
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:12,251
asked her about,
although maybe having a bit of trouble 

23
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:12,320
with their career,
I've seen this many,

24
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:14,270
many times,
so this is an amalgam.

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,750
This is a story that's an amalgam and I 
talked to her about the other elements 

26
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:20,570
of your life.
It's like,

27
00:01:20,571 --> 00:01:20,900
Whoa,

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,510
you know,

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,670
there's only five things you do in life,
so you've got your career down,

30
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,950
you know,
what do you do outside of your career 

31
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,610
that's meaningful and engaging.
How are things going with your family?

32
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,560
Could be your family of origin,
your siblings,

33
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,290
whatever.
Do you have an intimate relationship and

34
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,840
like what's your plan for your own 
family?

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,500
And apart from those five things,
there's sort of something like get some 

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,011
exercise now and then don't eat too 
badly and try to stay away from the 

37
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:49,011
drugs.
You know,

38
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:51,960
that,
that kind of the crime that kind of lays

39
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:56,370
out life.
And if you miss any of those five things

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,100
or if you do any of those other things 
wrong,

41
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,590
then you're in trouble and you can get 
away with missing a couple of them.

42
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:02,910
But not all of them,
you know.

43
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:04,770
And she said something along the lines 
of,

44
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,480
well,
I'm not sure I should bring a child into

45
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:07,230
this world.

46
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,670
And I thought,
Oh God,

47
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:13,671
Christ,
you've got to come up with something 

48
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:13,671
better than that.
Such a bloody cliche,

49
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:13,671
which is what I told her.
I said,

50
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:14,940
you know,
he must've thought that up when you were

51
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:16,170
16.
It's like,

52
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,400
really?
That's your,

53
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,380
that you can't do any better.
This was a very,

54
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,110
very smart woman.
It's like creating your unique.

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,190
You can't do any better than that.
It's like,

56
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,150
yes,
obviously this is a veil of tears and a,

57
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,080
you know,
a well of suffering and all of that.

58
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,890
If you asked 30 people who are wondering
about having children,

59
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,280
why they're wondering,
20 of them will say that.

60
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,650
And so that tells you how original it 
is.

61
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:40,930
It's not original at all.
It's not a thought.

62
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,350
It's like this little.
It's like a,

63
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,550
it's like a,
it's a meme or something that lives in 

64
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,221
your mind.
It's not a thought and it's certainly 

65
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:50,221
not something.

66
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:52,270
It's certainly not something that you 
should just take it face value and say,

67
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:53,800
oh,
well I'm not having a family.

68
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:54,540
Then it's like,
no,

69
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,550
no.
You kind of look at that and you 

70
00:02:59,550 --> 00:02:59,550
criticize it a little bit.
It's like,

71
00:02:59,550 --> 00:02:59,550
well,
the pop,

72
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,410
the.
It's the other one.

73
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,430
That's the other one that's very common.
There's too many people on the planet 

74
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,450
already.
It's like,

75
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,750
I really don't like that statement.
It's like,

76
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,290
just who are you going to ask to leave?
Just how are you going to get them to 

77
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:16,290
leave?
You know?

78
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,570
It's a serious question and who says 
there's too many people?

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,760
What the Hell's wrong with people?
Anyways?

80
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,880
Sorry,
we're running around ruining the planet.

81
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,030
Yeah,
so like I think it was the club of Rome 

82
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,120
who,
who prophesied by the way that there 

83
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,120
would be so many people on the planet by
the year 2000,

84
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,260
that there would be widespread 
starvation and they were completely and 

85
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,910
utterly wrong about that and I think it 
was the club of Rome who either compared

86
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:42,730
us to a virus or a cancer on the face of
the planet.

87
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,630
It's like,
oh,

88
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:45,430
really?
That's what you think about people a,

89
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,670
aren't you something?
Isn't that something to think about?

90
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:50,890
Human beings,
viruses and cancer.

91
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,910
What do you do with viruses and cancer?
Invite them in and make them at home.

92
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,660
It's like,
no,

93
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,240
he tried to eradicate them.
If you've got a bloody well,

94
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:03,241
watch your metaphors folks,
because it isn't clear that you come up 

95
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:04,720
with them or that they run you,
so you better watch him.

96
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,410
So anyways,
Mary and Mary's the great mother,

97
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:13,760
right?
That she's the mother.

98
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,820
That's what Mary is.
Whether she existed or not is not the 

99
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:18,820
point.
She exists,

100
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,530
at least as a hyper reality.
She exists as the mother.

101
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,870
Well,
what's the sacrifice of the mother?

102
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,800
Well,
that's easy.

103
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:28,280
If you're a mother and you,
if you're a mother who's worth her salt,

104
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,030
you offer your son to be destroyed by 
the world.

105
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,880
That's what you do.
I mean,

106
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,960
that's what's going to happen,
right?

107
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:38,780
He's gonna be born and he's going to 
suffer.

108
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:42,800
He's gonna have his trouble in life.
He's going to have his illnesses.

109
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,990
He's going to face his failures and 
catastrophes and he's going to die.

110
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,390
That's what's going to happen.
And if you're awake,

111
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,310
you know that,
and then you say,

112
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:57,311
well,
perhaps he will live in a way that will 

113
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,220
justify that,
and then you try to have that happen and

114
00:04:58,221 --> 00:05:00,650
that's what makes you worthy of a statue
like that.

115
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,010
But still the sacrifice of the mother.
Is it right to bring a baby into this 

116
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,520
terrible world?

117
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,060
Well,
every woman asked yourself that 

118
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,060
question.
Some say no.

119
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,850
And they have the reasons Mary answers 
yes.

120
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Voluntarily.
Mary is the archetype of the woman who 

121
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,661
answers yes to life voluntarily.
That's what that image means.

122
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,550
And not because she's blind,
she knows what's going to happen.

123
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,900
And so she's the archetipal 
representation of the woman who says yes

124
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:41,380
to life knowing full well what 
[inaudible] life is not naive,

125
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,220
not someone who got pregnant in the 
backseat of the 1957 Chevy,

126
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:46,060
you know,
in one,

127
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:47,290
in a,
one night of,

128
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:47,960
of,
of,

129
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:50,440
of half drunk idiocy.
Not that,

130
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,650
but consciously,
consciously knowing what's to come and 

131
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,511
then also allows it to happen.
Because that's another thing that's a 

132
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:01,640
testament to the courage of mothers.
And My mother was good at this.

133
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:05,120
My mother's a very agreeable person too,
agreeable for her own good,

134
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,870
but that's what happens if you're 
agreeable because you're too agreeable 

135
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,120
if for your own good.
That's the definition of agreeable.

136
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,630
And so she's a nice person and still is.
Luckily she's still alive and we've had 

137
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,750
a very good relationship and I have 
always been able to make her laugh,

138
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,250
which is,
which is a good thing.

139
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,710
And,
but she was tough cookie.

140
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:25,640
That woman,
you know,

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,080
if,
if,

142
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:27,400
uh,

143
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,940
remember once she came across,
I was out playing in this spec baseball 

144
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,890
diamond,
little diamond in the empty lot.

145
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:42,891
Really in this little town I grew up in.
I was about 10 and she walked by.

146
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,010
I was there with a bunch of my friends 
and I was about to have a fistfight with

147
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,810
this little tough kid that I hung around
with.

148
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,820
And there were half girls on the team 
and the fistfight had some relationship 

149
00:06:54,241 --> 00:06:56,140
to status maneuvering,
you know,

150
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,780
in relationship to that.
Anyways,

151
00:06:57,781 --> 00:06:59,970
we're going to have a fight.
And my mum walked by,

152
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,120
she took a look and I could see from her
demeanor that she knew exactly what was 

153
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:11,091
about to happen and she looked for a 
second and then she walked by and I 

154
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:12,360
thought,
Whoa,

155
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:14,730
good work mom.
No kidding.

156
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:19,731
Hey.
It's like last bloody thing I needed at 

157
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,040
that moment was for her to come charge 
it up and say,

158
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,870
you boys aren't planning to have a 
fight,

159
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,070
are you?
It's like,

160
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,520
well yeah mom,
where we're actually planning to have a 

161
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:28,520
fight and now that you came and 
intervened.

162
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,230
I actually lost before the God damn 
thing even started.

163
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,810
So two thumbs up for mum.
She was also the person that said 

164
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,020
because I had some trouble with my dad 
when I was a kid,

165
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,930
adolescent,
he had some trouble with me.

166
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:48,870
So you know,
it was 50 slash 50.

167
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:51,810
That's for now,
it's probably 70 slash 30 with me on the

168
00:07:51,811 --> 00:07:55,080
70 end of that being the trouble.
And anyways,

169
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,500
I left home when I was about 17 and she 
said something really interesting when I

170
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,990
left home.
She said it was too good at home.

171
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:05,820
You'd never leave.
I thought,

172
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,100
hey mom,
that's pretty good,

173
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,680
you know,
for,

174
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,100
for an agreeable person,
you've got a real spine man.

175
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,900
So that was pretty good.

176
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,130
So.

177
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,490
So you know,
mother that says this,

178
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:22,420
the mother is the person who also says,
get out there,

179
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,890
take your God damn lumps because you're 
tough enough so that you can handle it.

180
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,610
She doesn't say you just stayed down 
there in your bedroom bruiting away 

181
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:38,100
because the world is unfair and treating
you badly and your suffering is too 

182
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,010
much.
She says,

183
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:40,570
yeah,
there's a lot of suffering out there,

184
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:43,720
but you're a hell of a lot tougher than 
you think you are.

185
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,210
So.
