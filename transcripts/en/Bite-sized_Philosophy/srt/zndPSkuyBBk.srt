1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,980
So,
um,

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,140
in the past I've done some work with big
brother,

3
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:04,790
big sister and whatever.
Um,

4
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,820
that being said that the most common 
story I tend to hear from 50 youth is 

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,060
that they're raised in a single family 
home,

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,210
usually with a mom,
daddy's there on the picture and 

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:16,210
alcoholic,
whatever,

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,811
whatever they brought her.
So we have this child who is trying to 

9
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,090
seek ways to make himself healthy and 
empower himself in ways that a healthy 

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:25,730
father should have done.
So,

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,910
you know,
between the formative years of like one 

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:30,910
to four.
So I think,

13
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:30,910
you know,
I'm going with this,

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,160
um,
how,

15
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,980
let's say for someone who born without 
like a good father figure,

16
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,070
where would they go out in the world and
like what four spheres of influence 

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,401
where they try to expose themselves to,
to like gain access to that Fountain of 

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Health and knowledge at a father or a 
good father figure should have provide 

19
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:47,950
them to in the first place.

20
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,280
Okay.
Well,

21
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:53,290
partly,
I mean certainly to some degree a good 

22
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,561
mother can provide that to some degree,
although it's hard for one person to be 

23
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,510
everything right.
You know?

24
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:58,750
And I think one of the conundrums that 
face women,

25
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:01,090
and this is a tough one,
and this is why I think women are higher

26
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:03,610
end trade agreeableness and higher in 
trait negative emotion,

27
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:08,611
is that the primary problem that a woman
has with an infant is why not throw it 

28
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:12,610
out a window because it's very annoying.
I mean it's there all the time.

29
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:15,340
It's constant demand.
It's absolutely constantly man,

30
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:20,341
tremendous dependency.
And so a woman has to be tilted towards 

31
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:22,140
mercy.
That's how it looks to me like.

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,730
And especially during.
It's so important during the.

33
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,970
Especially the first year when children 
are so unbelievably vulnerable.

34
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,100
And so I think it's very difficult for 
women to be merciful like that and to 

35
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,390
make the shift to encouraging 
disciplinary.

36
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,280
I think that's a very difficult thing 
for people to do simultaneously.

37
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,410
Although you know,
people,

38
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,530
people.
I'm not saying that women are always 

39
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,020
only merciful and men are always only 
encouraging disciplinarians,

40
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:50,050
but things do sort themselves out to 
some degree like that.

41
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:54,130
And I think also the biochemical 
transformations that accompany pregnancy

42
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:58,570
and childbirth and lactation also killed
a mother towards that as well because he

43
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:00,370
has to really love that little thing.
Right?

44
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,990
It's,
it's number one,

45
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:06,991
no matter what it demands and then 
telling it what to do and making sure 

46
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:07,210
it's behaving properly.
That's,

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,080
that's a whole different issue now.
But the kids who lack fathers,

48
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:12,760
I mean,
first of all,

49
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:17,761
they can find that to some degree in 
their friends and that's often what 

50
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:17,761
father this boys do in particular.
They,

51
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:20,680
they,
they go into gangs and they generate the

52
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,750
missing men masculinity and the game.

53
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,030
Well that's not so good because like 
what the hell do they know that?

54
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,250
Well,
they don't know anything,

55
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:32,251
right?
They're just stupid kids and they're 

56
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:32,410
like 15 years old and their testosterone
is pumping and they're trying to get the

57
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:34,570
hell away from their mother,
which is what they're supposed to do.

58
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,370
And they're not in the right position to
exercise authority over themselves.

59
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:42,430
So that's not good.
They can find it in education,

60
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:44,040
they can find it in books,
they can find it.

61
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,810
Movies,
they can find it in sports heroes and so

62
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:51,811
forth because the image of the father is
fragmented and distributed among the 

63
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:52,270
community,
but it's very,

64
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:55,180
very difficult to not have a father and 
you know,

65
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:56,920
one of the things that we're doing in 
our society,

66
00:02:56,921 --> 00:03:01,921
which I think is.
I think it's absolutely is that we're 

67
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:03,280
making the case that all families are 
equal.

68
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,570
It's like,
sorry,

69
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,690
no wrong.
There's no empirical data supporting 

70
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:09,690
that proposition.
By the way.

71
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,940
It's much better for kids to have two 
parents who those parents are.

72
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:16,120
That's a whole different issue,
but if I could just one more thing.

73
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:18,090
Oh,
how would you ask that question too?

74
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,100
Let's see.
A daughter who was raised by a father 

75
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,961
because she would obviously have 
different ways of find those fragments 

76
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:27,781
of her missing father then like a boy 
would instead because obviously they're 

77
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:27,781
raised differently or at least they 
should have been.

78
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,410
Well,
I think it's the same issue,

79
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,190
you know?
I mean,

80
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,630
I think.
I think that another danger that 

81
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,531
emerges,
Mrs [inaudible] of course famous 

82
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:39,451
observation is that you know,
if there's mom and child or father and 

83
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:44,461
child,
that relationship can get a little 

84
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:46,231
closer than it should and then the lines
get blurry and mixed and I'm not saying 

85
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:48,310
that that happens to everyone obviously,
but,

86
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,640
but it's still a danger that that's 
inherent in the situation.

87
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,810
They're were thrust together too tightly
without sufficient resources and so the 

88
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,561
responsibility has to be distributed 
more and like I really do think that 

89
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:03,910
it's the sign of the degeneration of the
society when the,

90
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,940
when,
when single parenthood becomes anything 

91
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,880
approximating the norm,
it's not a good idea.

92
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,270
Then the.
I'm part of the reason I believe that 

93
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,330
and I think this has to do with the 
overwhelming selfishness of,

94
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,520
of,
of modern life is that marriage isn't 

95
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,430
for the people who were married.
It's for the children obviously,

96
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,960
and like if you can't handle that,
grow the hell up Sarah.

97
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,110
I mean,
seriously.

98
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,260
Yeah.
Seriously.

99
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,270
Once you,
once you have kids,

100
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,360
yes.
It is not about you,

101
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,640
period.
Now,

102
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,560
that doesn't mean it isn't about you at 
all,

103
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,070
but it just seems so self evident to me.
I can't believe that anybody would even 

104
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,840
would even question it.
Oh,

105
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,170
let's.
Oh yes.

106
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:51,490
Well,
I'm certainly aware of that.

107
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,830
Yes.
It's questioned.

108
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,300
It's almost illegal to question it now,
you know,

109
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,310
to,
to or illegal to make the set of 

110
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,911
propositions that I make,
so that's the best I can do.

111
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,930
That's excellent.
Thank you.
