1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,990
One of the things that's quite 
interesting about people who have Russo,

2
00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:07,991
he and ideas about children,
so children are all good and they get 

3
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:11,211
corrupted by society,
which is half true because they're also 

4
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:15,120
not good and they get shaped and 
discipline by society.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,720
But there were so many types after our 
very interesting.

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:23,721
When their kids hit teenage years or 
when they're judging like say criminal 

7
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:29,661
teenagers.
It's like the child is perfect until 

8
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:32,481
they hit like 11.
Then they turned into a teenager and 

9
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:34,791
then they're like thugs.
So they go from good to thug in one 

10
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:34,791
move,
you know?

11
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:39,231
And,
and you often see that in families too 

12
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:39,630
that have treated especially their 
daughters like a princess,

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,080
you know?
And then they hit puberty and the 

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,770
parents who have princess them to death 
have no idea what to do with them.

15
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:48,420
And so then they become demonized.

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,420
And so the,
the overly good child turns into the 

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,830
overly wicked teenager.
And sometimes they'll act that out to.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,340
One of the things I've seen with girls 
who are held in princess esteem when 

19
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:05,100
they're little and their parents have 
too tight a grip on them.

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,110
And too much of a demand for good 
behaviors,

21
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:10,920
they'll find some nasty character to 
associate with who will tear them out of

22
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:15,921
the family.
No bikers are really good for that sort 

23
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:15,921
of thing.
So not.

24
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:18,540
And especially if you have some vengeful
thoughts towards your parents.

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Nice.
Biker is your perfect solution to that 

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:23,840
problem.
