1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,840
Well,
again,

2
00:00:00,841 --> 00:00:03,850
I see that it's a consequence of 
continual adjective,

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,800
agitation by I would say a minority of 
the left,

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,820
the radical left in particular,
and those are people who aren't Marxist 

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,450
Slash Neo Marxist in their fundamental 
ideological orientation and have joined 

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,041
that in an unholy union with the worst 
of French postmodernism and and they,

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,110
they push it forward ideological 
certainty and the thing that,

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,350
the thing that's really distressing 
about that is that if you know anything 

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,470
about the history of oppressed people,
let's say,

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,870
much as I hate to engage in that 
particular form of dialogue under the 

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,610
current conditions,
it's pretty obvious that it's freedom of

12
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:45,150
speech is freedom.
That's particularly important for people

13
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:47,240
who don't have anything else,
right?

14
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:48,930
It's,
if you're supporting freedom of speech,

15
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:50,970
you're not supporting the status quo.
I mean,

16
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:51,870
just think about,
let's,

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,880
let's use the logic of the radical 
leftists and assume that society is a 

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,400
tyrannical hierarchy and the people at 
the top have the upper hand in 

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,550
everything,
including access to communication.

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,120
These people are not your friends.

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,750
No,
that's mark my words.

22
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,070
Now it's the sounds of the barbarians 
pounding at the gates.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Right?
That's awesome.

24
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,890
I'll tell you again to use it in Kuwait,

25
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,100
what would you call it in Kuwait?
Sensation is the best formulation of 

26
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,970
their argument.
And there's not much difference between 

27
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,010
knocking on the doors and knocking on 
you.

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,120
So keep that in mind.
It's not a music,

29
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,460
there's nothing to it.
There's nothing for it.

30
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,760
I think that's also quite appalling is 
that there is no evidence whatsoever 

31
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,811
that the people who are conducting these
protests know what it is that they're 

32
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:14,530
protesting against in a way was in.

33
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,570
Alright,
alright.

34
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,940
I was in the midst of a discussion and 
attempting to make the case that it's 

35
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:30,420
freedom of speech.
That's.

36
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,480
That is what people who have nothing 
still have.

37
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,750
Right?
So if you look at the tyrannical 

38
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,601
structure of our society,
let's say the people at the top have 

39
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:44,901
access to means of communication.
Everyone knows that it's the people at 

40
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:47,010
the bottom who have the right to say 
what they think,

41
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,250
however badly they say it.
It enables them to get a toe hold into 

42
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,360
the system and to and to make their 
suffering known.

43
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,560
That's what freedom of speech is for and
so like what's the protest against that,

44
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:04,561
and I'll tell you,
you know that the rowdy called Neo 

45
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:07,720
Marxist types.
They speak the language of power and 

46
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,710
that's what they're speaking right now,
and if you want to live in a world where

47
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:12,460
everyone speaks the language of power,
then just let them do what they're doing

48
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:15,100
and see what happens.
I wouldn't recommend it.

49
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,280
It's not a pretty rote and you're all in
a position.

50
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:23,281
You're on a situation in your life now 
where you have to make decisions about 

51
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:26,401
this sorts of things.
Like is this the sort of institution 

52
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:26,401
that you want this to be.
