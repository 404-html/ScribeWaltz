1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,840
There's a whole set of expectations that
are governing what we're doing,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,410
like you don't want me to take your your
little tablet there and smash it.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,360
That would be shocking,
right?

4
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:11,370
You would know what the hell to do,
right?

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,400
You'd be somewhere different if I did 
that and you wouldn't know where you 

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,261
were and that's another thing to know 
because that's a fundamental difference.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,440
There is a fundamental difference 
between knowing where you are and not 

8
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:32,541
knowing where you are.
I think it's in some sense the 

9
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:36,470
fundamental difference.
You can think about it as the 

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,470
distinction between explored an 
unexplored territory,

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,620
but you have to.

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,940
I don't know if you've ever taken a cat 
to a new house.

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,440
Cats hate that,
and because in their old house and maybe

14
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:56,441
in their old neighborhood,
they slunk around at the edges,

15
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,260
checking everything out.
They start out freight afraid.

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,630
They check everything out.
They know where to hide.

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,620
They know where to.
They knew,

18
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,650
they knew,
they know what safe and they know that 

19
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,051
because they go somewhere and nothing 
happens and so then the assuming that 

20
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:14,351
it's safe and they slowly build up a 
neighborhood that they're comfortable 

21
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:19,271
with.
My Dad used to take the dog for a walk 

22
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:22,031
and then the cat got lonesome and so it 
started to follow him and first of all 

23
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:23,420
it would just go along the buildings,
the houses on their route,

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,100
no hiding really from predators and 
after awhile it got kinda comfortable 

25
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:32,000
with that and then it would follow right
behind the dog,

26
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,390
but it had a border and if my dad took 
the dog over one street too many for the

27
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:41,940
cat,
the cat would just sit on the corner and

28
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,590
you know,
cry like a cap cries.

29
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,750
It was like,
that's it for me,

30
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:52,751
man.
I'm not going any farther out into the 

31
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:55,391
unknown.
And so the distinction between the 

32
00:01:55,391 --> 00:02:00,221
territory that you have mastered and the
territory that you haven't mastered is a

33
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:06,311
fundamental distinction.
It's the distinction between home and 

34
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:10,540
the strange land.
And the thing about familiar territory 

35
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,950
for people is that most of the familiar 
territory that we inhabit is other 

36
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,031
people because we're so social.
So you can't really think it's a weird 

37
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:23,441
way of thinking about territory.
It's not exactly geographical objective 

38
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:27,611
territory.
It's territory with a dominance 

39
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:31,001
hierarchy in it and the dominance 
hierarchy has a predictable structure 

40
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:32,150
and you know where you fit in it most of
the time.

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,470
And so that when you act out in that 
territory surrounded by Europe,

42
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:40,471
people then often you get what you want 
and you're so thrilled about that 

43
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:44,120
because you just don't want someone 
acting radically around you.

44
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,800
Like,
and you know that.

45
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:50,801
So he walked down bloor and there's 
people there that should really be 

46
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:55,671
institutionalized.
But we did institutionalize them all so 

47
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:57,210
they could be free and free to be,
you know,

48
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,280
suffering and malfunctioning out on the 
street.

49
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,360
That's what the freedom ended up being.
But you know,

50
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,410
you'll walk by someone like that who's 
moderating away to the voices in his 

51
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:10,160
head,
didn't,

52
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:10,760
you know,
maybe

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,120
striking out against whatever it is 
that's plaguing him.

54
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:21,121
And you will make eye contact.
You might even go across the street,

55
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:23,740
you're certainly going to give him a 
wide berth.

56
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:28,741
You're going to keep a distance between 
him and you and you're going to hope 

57
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:33,721
that you don't attract his attention 
because he's not in the dominance 

58
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:38,011
hierarchy and you don't know what the 
hell he might do and that's unexplored 

59
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:40,900
territory too.
That's another way of thinking about it,

60
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:45,901
like we inhabit time and space,
not just space and not just time.

61
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:50,800
We inhabit time and space and our 
territories are spacial.

62
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:55,801
Temporal.
We're here now and this is safe now and 

63
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,990
it saved partly because of the physical 
structure and it's working,

64
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,850
but it's also safe because none of you 
are manifesting peculiar behavior,

65
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,810
but if you started to manifest peculiar 
behavior,

66
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,620
if you stood up and started monitoring 
or yelling or maybe attacking someone 

67
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,331
next to you,
all the rest of you would freeze first 

68
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:20,080
because then all of a sudden this would 
be unexplored territory.

69
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,070
The match between what you want,
which is a peaceful lecture that you 

70
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,701
hope has some content.
The match between what you want and 

71
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:34,460
what's happening has vanished and so 
then you're not.

72
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,810
You don't know where you are and so then
what do you do when you don't know where

73
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:43,811
you are?
What do you do when you don't know what 

74
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:43,811
to do?
Well,

75
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:44,600
if you're your computer,
you just crash,

76
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:45,610
but

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
you know what good is that to you?
You're just going to die.

78
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,180
That isn't helpful.
You freeze first and then maybe you 

79
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:58,480
cautiously,
cautiously attended,

80
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:03,481
or maybe you don't.
Maybe you just keep your damn eyes 

81
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:03,481
averted and you sit there and you hope 
that no one notices you.

82
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,080
That's a Predator or prey response,
right?

83
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:11,081
That's like a rabbit frozen when it 
thinks a fox is looking at it and we 

84
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:14,681
were prey animals for a long time.
There was a cat that they recently 

85
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:19,571
discovered,
a prehistoric cat that had this bottom 

86
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:22,810
single tooth and they found out that a 
human skull fit right inside its mouth 

87
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:27,860
and so it could grab you here and Pierce
the back of your skull with its with its

88
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,500
single tooth and that's what it was 
evolved for.

89
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,830
So you know it's under such conditions.
We evolved and we're predators 

90
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:42,941
obviously,
but were tasty predators and so other 

91
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:45,911
things were perfectly happy to eat us.
And so when you're aware you don't know 

92
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:52,851
what to do,
you act like a prey animal and that's 

93
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:56,060
probably what you shouldn't do because 
maybe if you keep your head down and 

94
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,300
shut the hell up there,
be any attention to attracted to you and

95
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,460
maybe you'll get through it.
You know,

96
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,810
you,
you might decide unlikely to intervene 

97
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,380
and take the guy down,
but,

98
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,670
but you would be the exception rather 
than the norm.

99
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,920
And it's unsurprising.
