1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,200
Psychopaths,
I don't,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,500
I say this,
I hope non naively also having dealt 

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,020
with psychopaths in my clinical practice
and I would say now and then in my life,

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,770
I don't believe in psychopaths.
I don't believe that we know enough to 

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,750
say there are people born without 
conscience.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,450
Um,
I don't think the psychometric 

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,620
measurement of psychopathy is everything
that it should be.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,560
I've been trying to model it bay in the 
big five domain.

9
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:35,520
I think now it's complicated because,
so I would say a psychopath,

10
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:37,650
the classic psychopath is likely 
extroverted,

11
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:42,651
especially assertive,
disagreeable and unconscientious and 

12
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:46,020
maybe extremely low in neuroticism.
So you can't frighten them.

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,180
But so that's a rare combination because
it's extreme on many traits,

14
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:52,320
right?
But that,

15
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:57,321
I don't believe that that means that 
someone with that personality 

16
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:00,801
configuration is doomed from birth to a 
pathological existence because there's 

17
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:03,480
things about psychopathy that,
that the,

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,030
that the classifiers,
those who claim like collectively that 

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,620
the psychopath is born in some sense 
can't explain.

20
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:11,970
It's like,
well,

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,590
what about the cruelty?
It seems to be a motive there.

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,720
You know,
with our passionless and they lack,

23
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,220
they lack emotion.
Well,

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,060
why are they cruel then for 
entertainment?

25
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,660
Well,
but then you have to explain the 

26
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,211
entertainment motivation,
like there's a failure in some sense 

27
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:35,481
with the classic psychopathy theorists 
to come to grips with the problem of 

28
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:37,470
malevolence.
It's skirted over and you can't do that.

29
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:42,471
If you're talking about psychopathy,
it's like malevolence is the bloody 

30
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:42,471
issue here.
And so

31
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,140
the other issue with this psychopath is 
that he's irredeemable,

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,310
right?
That's the idea.

33
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,120
I don't think we know enough to make 
such claims now and that doesn't.

34
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,350
I know the psychopathy literature quite 
well and I have great respect for their 

35
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,720
primary researchers in the field.
I want to make that perfectly clear,

36
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,030
but we're talking at a different.
We're talking,

37
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,090
we're approaching the problem from a 
different level of analysis here.

38
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:11,091
Something like a spiritual level of 
analysis and I don't think that there's 

39
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:14,721
an easy,
easy translation from the descriptive 

40
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:17,520
psychometric psychiatric approach to the
spiritual level.

41
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,550
They don't match and I'm more likely to 
say let's not assume the soul is doomed 

42
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:24,690
from birth.
Right?

43
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,040
And I'm,
I'm loath to think that there are people

44
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:34,041
born irredeemable.
Although I do think there are 

45
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,521
irredeemable people knew that the death 
penalty issues interesting in that 

46
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:37,620
regard,
you know,

47
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,650
because I've read a lot about really 
terrible people and I've also read a lot

48
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:47,130
about what really terrible people said 
about themselves and many of them wished

49
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:52,131
for the death penalty and so it's 
absolutely clear that there are things 

50
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,420
that you can do that deserved the death 
penalty,

51
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,350
but that doesn't mean that the state 
should have the right to impose it.

52
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,030
That's a different question,
so yeah,

53
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,810
thank you.
