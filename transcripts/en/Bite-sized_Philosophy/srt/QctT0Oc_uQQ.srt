1
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,010
Heavy emphasis on dealing with future,
you mentioned that the program effects 

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,560
are much more pronounced than men 
specifically on the western to imagery 

3
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,890
and imagery and visual spatial abilities
related.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,160
And if so,
given that men on average have greater 

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,220
visual visual spatial ability because 
this account for the gender difference 

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:33,390
in the program's efficacy.

7
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,120
That's a lot of questions.
They're good questions.

8
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,150
Um,
I'll tell you a couple of strange things

9
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,190
that it takes that I don't really 
understand.

10
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:47,191
The first is when we've done the 
analysis of the effects of the future 

11
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:50,401
authoring program,
it has had a different differential 

12
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:53,320
impact on men and it's had a 
particularly differential impact on what

13
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:58,321
I would call it excluded men.
And so that would be non western ethic 

14
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:02,101
minority men or,
or what majority of men who aren't doing

15
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:04,180
very well.
So for example,

16
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:09,181
at Mohawk College,
the future authoring program had a 

17
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:12,271
particularly robust effect on Mohawk 
college students who are men who hadn't 

18
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:16,381
done very well in high school and knew,
hadn't picked a major that had a 

19
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:18,200
destination,
a career destination edits.

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,570
And so you can imagine those people are,
they have an ambiguous relationship with

21
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,460
the idea of education and they're not 
oriented specifically towards a goal.

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,880
They're not very motivated.
Now why did it have a differential 

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,780
effect on men now?
That's a good question.

24
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,670
Well,
first of all,

25
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:40,300
the women are doing better,
so it might just be a matter of the fact

26
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,670
that it does better for people who 
aren't doing as well.

27
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:44,410
And at the moment,
most of them are men,

28
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,170
I don't believe.
I think that might be part of it,

29
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,950
but I don't believe that's all of it.
I think that part of the reason that 

30
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,530
women are doing better is because 
they're agreeable.

31
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,950
And so if a system sets out a structure 
and says,

32
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,190
here's a pathway to attainment,
the women won't rebel against that.

33
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,530
They'll go along with it.
And that's working very well for them at

34
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:03,780
the moment.
The man,

35
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,790
especially the men on the disagreeable 
end of the distribution and there's way 

36
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,030
more men on the district disagreeable 
end of the distribution.

37
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,380
Then there are women,
right?

38
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:16,381
That's what you get from.
If you look at overlapping normal 

39
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:16,540
distributions.
So there's the male district,

40
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:20,680
female distribution for agreeableness,
mail distribution for agreeableness.

41
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,930
Tremendous overlap.
Okay.

42
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:27,931
Women are higher,
all the really agreeable people are 

43
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,331
women.
All the really disagreeable people are 

44
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:31,030
meant and maybe the real differences 
occur at the extremes,

45
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,930
right?
So,

46
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:32,800
so,
and it's,

47
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:37,030
it's a very interesting side effect of 
overlapping distributions so that people

48
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:42,031
can be mostly the same,
but that can still produce radical 

49
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,871
differences.
Disagreeable men won't do anything they 

50
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:47,470
don't want to do.
They just say up yours,

51
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,310
I'll go home and play video games with 
you.

52
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,980
I'm not listening to your stupid classes
and why should I work for you?

53
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,520
I'll just go have fun.
I'll do my own thing.

54
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,060
I don't think they're motivated.
And so then if you take the men who are 

55
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,060
like that and you say,
okay,

56
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,310
what do you want?

57
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,790
You can have what you want,
but you have figured out what it is.

58
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,560
So then they write down what they want 
and they think,

59
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:10,390
oh hey,
well that might be worth having.

60
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,630
So maybe I'll put some effort into it.
That's what it looks like to me.

61
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,990
Now,
you know that's weak evidence and this 

62
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,751
is a weak argument,
but I'm trying to stretch out my 

63
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:24,691
understanding to account for this,
but I'll tell you something else that's 

64
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:24,691
really weird.
I don't understand this either.

65
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:29,200
So more than 90 percent of the people 
who watch my videos on youtube are men.

66
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,860
Now.
That's weird because now about 80 

67
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:34,860
percent of psychology students are 
women,

68
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,280
so that is not what you would expect,
right?

69
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,820
You would expect that the majority of 
them would be women and you might say,

70
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:44,821
well,
it's because of the political stance 

71
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:44,821
I've taken and I thought,
well that's possible.

72
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:46,060
So I went and looked at the demographic 
data because I have that.

73
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,610
Well before I did any of the political 
videos,

74
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,780
85 percent of my viewers were men,
so it's actually increased a bit.

75
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:56,380
It's increased by six percent and that's
not trivial,

76
00:03:56,381 --> 00:04:00,550
but it was still overwhelmingly men.
So that was interesting.

77
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,420
I thought,
what the hell?

78
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:02,590
Why is that?
Exactly?

79
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,950
And then now I've been watching crowds 
when I've been talking to them and the 

80
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,190
crowds that have come to see me in 
person.

81
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,370
This happened at the University of 
Toronto Free Speech Debate and I 

82
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,551
actually noticed it and commented on it 
before the debate took place because I 

83
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:21,061
was talking about intrinsic differences 
between men and women and I looked 

84
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:21,061
around the room and I thought,
hmm,

85
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:25,770
hey,
80 percent of the people in this room 

86
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:25,770
are men.
So I had all the men,

87
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,560
women and women stand up and then all 
the men stand up.

88
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,320
I said,
look like here's a natural experiment.

89
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,770
For some reason,
80 percent of the people who showed up 

90
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:34,770
to this are men now.
Everybody thought I was kinda cracked to

91
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,550
to do that.
And it was a risk,

92
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:37,110
you know?
And,

93
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,470
and I,
but I thought,

94
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,820
no,
there's something going on here.

95
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,180
And then what's interesting now is that 
every public appearance that I've made 

96
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,530
that's related to the sort of topics 
that we're discussing is overwhelmingly 

97
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:49,530
men.
It's like,

98
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,420
it's like 85 to 90 percent.
And so I thought,

99
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:53,260
wow,
that's weird.

100
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:55,060
Like what the Hell's going on here?
Exactly.

101
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,420
And then the other thing I've noticed is
that I've been talking a lot to the 

102
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,630
crowds that I've been talking to,
not about rights,

103
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:03,280
but about responsibility,
right?

104
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,260
Because he can't have the bloody 
converse.

105
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,290
What are you doing?
You can't have the conversation about 

106
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,571
rights without the conversation about 
responsibility because your rights are 

107
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:13,630
my responsibility.

108
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,460
That's what they are technically.
So you just can't have only half of that

109
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:20,860
discussion and we're only having half 
that discussion.

110
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,060
The question is,
well,

111
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:27,061
what the hell are you leaving out?
If you only have that half of the 

112
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:27,730
discussion and the answer is,
well,

113
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:30,430
you're leaving out responsibility and 
then the question is,

114
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,600
well,
what are you leaving out?

115
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,480
If you're leaving out responsibility?
And the answer might be,

116
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,550
well maybe you're leaving out the 
meaning of life.

117
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,070
That's what it looks like to me.
It's like here you are suffering away.

118
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,590
What makes it worthwhile?
Rights.

119
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,680
You know you're completely,
oh,

120
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:51,260
you're completely.
You have no idea what you're you.

121
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,080
It's almost impossible to describe how 
bad an idea that is.

122
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,830
Responsibility.
That's what gives life meaning.

123
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,030
It's like lift alone.
Then you can tolerate yourself,

124
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,770
right?
Because look at your useless,

125
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,320
easily hurt,
easily killed.

126
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:10,940
Why should you have any self respect?

127
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,170
That's the story of the fall.
Pick something up and carry it.

128
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,260
Pick.
Make it heavy enough so that you can 

129
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:20,260
think,
yeah,

130
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,620
well useless as I am.
At least I could move that from there to

131
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,690
there.
Well,

132
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,700
what's really cool about that is that 
when I talked to these crowds about 

133
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,031
this,
the man's eyes light up and that's very 

134
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:34,180
like I've seen that phenomena because 
I've been talking about this 

135
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,430
mythological material for a long time 
and I can see when I'm watching crowds,

136
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:39,431
people you know their eyebrows lift,
their eyes light up because I put 

137
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:40,670
something together for them,
not sweat,

138
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:45,671
mythological stories do,
so I'm not taking responsibility for 

139
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:45,671
that.
That's what the story's due.

140
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:46,730
So I save this story.
People go click,

141
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:47,390
click,
click.

142
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,660
You know when their eyes light up,
but this responsibility thing that's a 

143
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,320
whole new order of this is that young 
men are so hungry for that.

144
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,320
It is unbelievable.
And one of the things I've been talking 

145
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,351
to some of the people who've been 
running for the conservative leadership 

146
00:07:02,351 --> 00:07:06,580
in Canada and I've been talking to them 
about if the difficulties they have 

147
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,760
communicating with young people because 
conservatives,

148
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:12,761
what,
what the hell are they going to sell to 

149
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:12,761
young people,
right?

150
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:12,761
Because being conservative is something 
that happens when you're older.

151
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,310
They can sell responsibility.
No one's selling it.

152
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,550
And the thing is for men,
there's nothing but responsibility.

153
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,210
No,
I was watching the simpsons the other 

154
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:25,210
day.
I watched the first simpsons episode and

155
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,770
I deconstructed it.
And so it's really interesting.

156
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:32,120
So what happens in the first Simpson 
episode is that it's Christmas and homer

157
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:37,121
and marge,
you're going to buy some Christmas 

158
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:38,951
presents,
but homer doesn't get his Christmas 

159
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:40,901
bonus.
And so it was absolutely crushed by 

160
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:43,751
that.
And that actually is a recurring theme 

161
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:44,210
in the simpsons where homer loses his 
job or something like that,

162
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:45,440
or count night,
make enough money.

163
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,110
He's completely crushed even though he's
kind of useless,

164
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:49,730
bumbling,
laughing,

165
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:51,710
fool of a guy,
you know?

166
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,980
The thing that gives that show his soul 
is that he still oriented towards his 

167
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:56,990
family.
That's what makes them vulnerable,

168
00:07:56,991 --> 00:08:01,730
is that foolish as he is.
He's decided to adopt responsibility for

169
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,760
his family and to try to bear that and 
so he's not.

170
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:09,761
He's a holy fool.
He's not a complete fool and so 

171
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:12,641
interesting watching the story because 
he suffers dreadfully as a consequence 

172
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:13,700
of not being able to fulfill his 
responsibility.

173
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,960
Well,
that's for men.

174
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,840
Women have their sets of 
responsibilities.

175
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,240
They're not the same.
Right?

176
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:25,510
Because then they're complicated because
women of course have to take primary 

177
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,810
responsibility for for having infants at
least,

178
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,700
but then also for caring for them,
they're.

179
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,290
They're structured differently than men 
per biological necessity,

180
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:38,291
even if it's not a psychological issue 
and it's also partly a psychological 

181
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:38,291
issue.

182
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,600
Women know what they have to do.
Men have to figure out what they have to

183
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:44,630
do and if they have nothing worth living
for them,

184
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:49,631
they stay Peter Pan and why the hell not
because the alternative to valued 

185
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,920
responsibility is impulsive,
low class pleasure,

186
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,570
and you saw that independent Akio story,
right?

187
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,250
That's pleasure island.
It's like,

188
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:07,251
well,
why lift the load if there's nothing in 

189
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:07,251
it for you?
That's another thing that we're doing to

190
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:08,310
men.
That's a very bad idea,

191
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,820
and two boys,
it's like your pathological and 

192
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:13,820
oppressive.
It's like,

193
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,141
fine.
Then why the hell am I going to play if 

194
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:18,141
that's the.
If that's the situation,

195
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,350
if I get no credit for bearing 
responsibility,

196
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,630
can bloody well be sure I'm not going to
bear it,

197
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,020
but then you know your life is useless 
and meaningless and you have.

198
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,820
You're not,
you're full of self contempt,

199
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:29,340
denialism and,
and that's not good.

200
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,430
And so that's why I think that's what I 
think's going on at a deeper level with 

201
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,721
regards to men needing this direction.
A man has to decide that he's going to 

202
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:40,290
do something.
He has to decide that.

203
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,230
Yeah,
well,

204
00:09:51,231 --> 00:09:54,200
you know partly what you're trying to do
in the future authoring process to say,

205
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,550
okay,
well what's your highest value?

206
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,440
Right?
It's the star.

207
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,370
It's like,
okay,

208
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,280
what are you aiming for?
You can decide man,

209
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,080
but you know,
there some criteria.

210
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,260
It should be good for you.
It should be good for you in a way that 

211
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,100
facilitates your moving forward.
Maybe it should be good for you in a way

212
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:12,170
that's also good for the family and the 
community.

213
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,380
It should cover the the domain of life.
I mean there's constraints on what you 

214
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,310
should regard as a value,
but you.

215
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,050
But within those constraints,
you have the choice.

216
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,660
You have choice.
Well,

217
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:31,661
the thing is is that people will carry a
heavy load if they get to pick the god 

218
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:34,370
damn load so and they think,
well I won't carry any load.

219
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:35,000
It's like,
okay,

220
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:40,001
fine,
but then you're like the sled dog that 

221
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:40,001
doesn't have a sled.

222
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:40,001
Depaul,
you're just gonna.

223
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:42,410
You're going to tear a piece is out of 
your own legs because you're bored.

224
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,260
You know you need.
People are pack animals.

225
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:50,261
They need,
they need to pull against a weight and 

226
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:53,620
and that's not true for everyone.
It's not true particularly say for low 

227
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,921
conscientious people.
I mean maybe they're open and creative 

228
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:56,921
are extroverted and some other things,
but for the,

229
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,090
for the typical person,
they,

230
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,850
they,
they'll eat themselves,

231
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,030
they'll eat themselves up unless they 
have a load.

232
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:07,940
This is why there's such an opiod 
epidemic among a dispossessed white,

233
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,210
middle aged guys who were unemployed in 
the US.

234
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,820
It's like they lose their job.
They're done right?

235
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,180
They despise themselves.
They develop chronic pain syndromes and 

236
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,540
depression and the chronic pain is 
treated with opiates.

237
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,320
It's like that's what we're doing.
So yeah,

238
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,200
that's what it looks like to me is you 
have to.

239
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,260
And it's so interesting to watch the 
young man when you talk to them about 

240
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,260
responsibility.
There is a God damn thrilled about it.

241
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,980
It just blows me away.
It's like,

242
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:35,840
really?
That's what's.

243
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,230
That's the counterculture.
Grow the hell up and do something 

244
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,840
useful.
Really.

245
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:42,680
I could do that.
Oh,

246
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:46,340
I'm so excited by that idea.
No one ever mentioned that before.

247
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,600
It's like rights,
rights,

248
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:48,470
rights,
rights,

249
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,790
Jesus.
It's,

250
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,530
it's,
it's appalling.

251
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,460
It's,
it's,

252
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,520
and,
and I feel that that's deeply felt by 

253
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:57,520
the people who are,
who are coming out to,

254
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,680
to listen to these sorts of things,
to there.

255
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,740
They've had enough of that so.
And they better have because it's a non 

256
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,030
productive mode of being responsibility,
man.

257
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,510
That's where the meaning in life is.
So all right,

258
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,860
good.
One more class.

259
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:16,900
Hey,
we'll see you next week.
