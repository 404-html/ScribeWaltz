1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,640
And the Lord said unto Abraham,
and this is,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,830
this is the,
this is the opening of the story,

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,040
get thee out of thy country and from thy
kindred and from thy Father's House unto

4
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:16,221
a land that I will show thee.
And this is one of those phrases where 

5
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:19,941
every clause is significant.
Go somewhere you don't understand.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,240
That's the first thing.
Get the out of country.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,440
You know,
back in the 19 twenties,

8
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:30,441
there was a whole slew of American 
writers who ended up as expatriates in 

9
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:31,200
Paris.
Hemingway among them,

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,940
who wrote the Great Gatsby,
Fitzgerald,

11
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:37,380
yes.
And then a variety of others.

12
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:42,381
It was very inexpensive in Paris at the 
time and part of their transformation 

13
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:47,001
into great literary figures was the fact
that they were out of their country and 

14
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:47,001
now they could see what their country 
was.

15
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:49,080
Because you can't see what your country 
is until you leave it.

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,040
So you have to go into the unknown and 
that's God's first command.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,660
Go into the unknown because you already 
know what you know and so,

18
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:00,030
and that's not enough.
Unless you think you're enough.

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,280
And if you're not enough and you don't 
think you're enough,

20
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:04,020
then you have to go where you haven't 
been.

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,990
And so that's the first commandment to 
Abraham.

22
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:07,710
It's like,
okay,

23
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:08,730
that,
that's a good one.

24
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:11,370
That makes perfect sense.
Go to where you don't know.

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,980
Yes.
And from thy kindred will though,

26
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,100
does that mean it means grow up,
right?

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,280
That's what it means.
It means get away from your family 

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,440
enough so that you can establish your 
independence.

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,570
And that isn't because there's something
wrong with your family,

30
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:26,110
although perhaps there is,
you know,

31
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,500
as long as there is perhaps wrong with 
you,

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,260
but it means get away.
You know,

33
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,650
I talked to people very frequently whose
families have provided them with too 

34
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,190
much protection and they know it 
themselves.

35
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,500
And that means they are deprived of 
necessity.

36
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,700
You know,
one of the things that you see in,

37
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:44,220
in,
in the United States for example,

38
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:49,221
is that the children are first 
generation immigrants often do better 

39
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:54,081
than the children that their children.
And the reason for that is that the 

40
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:54,750
children are first generation 
immigrants,

41
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:59,751
have necessity driving them.
And you don't know how much you need 

42
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:02,991
necessity to drive you because maybe 
you're not very disciplined and if any 

43
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:04,740
catastrophe doesn't immediately be fall 
you.

44
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:08,820
If you don't act forthrightly today,
then maybe you never act forthrightly,

45
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:09,930
right?
Because the,

46
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,200
the gap between your foolishness and the
punishment is,

47
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,330
is lengthened by your unearned wealth.
And so you never grow up and learn and 

48
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,851
you have to get yourself away from your 
dependency in order to allow necessity 

49
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:28,431
to drive you forward.
And that's to become independent and to 

50
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:28,431
become mature.

51
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,830
And I think part of what's happening in 
our culture is that the,

52
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,470
the,
the force that's attacking the 

53
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,060
forthright movement forward of young men
in particular is afraid of the power of 

54
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:46,551
man because it's confused about the 
distinction between power and authority 

55
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:51,801
and competence.
Like I know a man who's who has 

56
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:54,570
authority and competence has power as a 
byproduct,

57
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,790
but the authority and competence is 
everything.

58
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,650
And,
and,

59
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,830
and people who can't,
that fail to make the distinction 

60
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:05,020
between power and authority of 
competence.

61
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:10,021
And they're afraid of power.
And so they destroy authority and 

62
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:12,841
competence.
And that's a terrible thing because we 

63
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:12,841
need authority and competence.
What else is going to,

64
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,820
what else is going to allow us to 
prevail in the long run?

65
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,680
And so you get away from your country 
and you get away from your kin and from 

66
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,060
your father's house,
right?

67
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,970
And you go out there and you establish 
yourself in the world.

68
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:29,971
It's a call to adventure.
That's what this first lines in the 

69
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:33,871
Abrahamic story is a call to adventure.
So great unto a land that I will show 

70
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:36,550
you.
Well,

71
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,510
you know,
what does that mean?

72
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:46,050
You know,
one of the things that I've been struck 

73
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,040
very hard by a number of writers,
Carl Young,

74
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,330
obviously among them,
I mean he,

75
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,770
he wrote things like Nicha that if you 
understand them,

76
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:55,630
they just break you into pieces.
You know.

77
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,970
And,
and one of the things that young 

78
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:00,970
understood in the psychoanalysts 
understand,

79
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,050
it's one of the most terrifying elements
of psychoanalytic thinking is very 

80
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,491
tightly allied with religious thinking,
which is that you are not the master of 

81
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:12,661
your own house.
There are spirits that dwell in you 

82
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:14,380
within you,
meaning you have a will,

83
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:18,880
and you can exercise a certain amount of
conscious control over your being,

84
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:23,881
but there are all sorts of things that 
occur within you that seem to be beyond 

85
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:25,300
your capacity to control your dreams.
For example.

86
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,310
That's a really good example of your 
impulses.

87
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,060
For example,
you might,

88
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,640
you might think of those as so foreign 
from you that they're not even.

89
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,530
You don't even want them to be part of 
you,

90
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,510
but,
but more subtly even.

91
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,450
How about what you're interested in?
What compels you?

92
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,130
Like,
where does that come from?

93
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,900
Exactly.
Because you can't,

94
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,740
you can't conjure it up of your own 
accord,

95
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:47,170
you know?
So if you're a student and you're taking

96
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:49,270
difficult course,
you might say to yourself,

97
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,450
well,
I need to sit down and study for three 

98
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,431
hours,
but then you sit down and that is what 

99
00:04:56,431 --> 00:04:56,431
happens.
Your attention goes everywhere.

100
00:04:56,431 --> 00:04:56,890
And you might say,
well,

101
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,780
whose attention is it?
Then?

102
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,450
If it goes everywhere because you say 
it's your attention,

103
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,050
it's like,
well,

104
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,610
hey,
if it's your attention,

105
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:05,920
maybe you'd be able to control it,
but you can't,

106
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,340
and so then you might think,
well jen and just exactly what the hell 

107
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:11,340
is controlling it,
and you might say,

108
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:11,890
well,
it's random.

109
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:13,570
It's the better not be random.

110
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,810
I can tell you that that's.
That happens to some degree in 

111
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,541
schizophrenia.
There's an element of randomness in 

112
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:21,541
that.
It's not random.

113
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:26,100
It's driven by the action of of 
phenomena that I think are best 

114
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,600
considered as something like 
subpersonalities.

115
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,340
They'll even.
That's only a partial description.

116
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,360
You can't make yourself interested in 
something.

117
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,890
Interest manifests itself in grips you.
That's a whole different thing and so 

118
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:45,880
what is it that's gripping you and how 
do you conceptualize that?

119
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:47,590
Is that a divine power?
Well,

120
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:52,591
it's divine as far as you're concerned 
because it grips you and you can't do 

121
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:54,940
anything about it,
and so there is a calling in you towards

122
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:56,890
what you're compelled by and what you're
interested in,

123
00:05:56,891 --> 00:06:00,140
and sometimes that might be very dark 
and sometimes not,

124
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,110
but you're compelled forward by your 
interest.

125
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,770
And so and so,
the idea that what moves you away from 

126
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:12,410
your country and your father's house and
the comforts of your childhood home is,

127
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,040
is something that's beyond you and that 
you listen to an Harken to.

128
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,410
That's exactly right.
And you can say,

129
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,880
well,
I don't want to call it that God.

130
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,460
It's like it doesn't matter what you 
call it.

131
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,540
Exactly.
It doesn't matter to what it is,

132
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,420
what it's called.
It still is,

133
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,180
and if you don't listen to it,
that's the other thing.

134
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,480
If you don't listen to it,
and I've been a clinician and talked to 

135
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,880
enough people now as old as I am,
to know this.

136
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:42,881
Absolutely,
if you do not listen to that thing that 

137
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:45,431
beckons you forward,
you will pay for it like you cannot 

138
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:48,310
possibly imagine.
You'll have everything that's terrible 

139
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,020
about life in your life and nothing 
about it that's good and worse.

140
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,110
You'll know that it was your fault and 
that you squandered what you could have 

141
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,110
had.
