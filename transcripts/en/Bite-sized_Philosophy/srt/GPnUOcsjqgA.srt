1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,560
And I,
and if I read philosophy,

2
00:00:01,561 --> 00:00:04,080
I tend not to read second rate 
philosophy,

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,320
and so I've tried to avoid the 
postmodernist system degree because 

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,281
they're,
they're incoherency is one of the least 

5
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:13,440
of their sins,
but they don't care about that.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:13,880
No,
no.

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,270
You've got to understand,
man,

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,970
the modernists and enlightenment people 
and even traditionalist who care about 

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,921
coherency,
the postmodernists don't believe and 

10
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:24,921
coherency.
They don't believe in.

11
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:25,110
And I'm,
I'm not making this up.

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,110
This is part of their philosophy.
They don't believe in logic.

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,740
You know,
Derrida says straight out that Western 

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,891
society is fallow logo centric by which 
he means male centered and privileging.

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,970
The idea of logic.
Well,

16
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:43,971
he doesn't buy any of that.
He doesn't think that there is a truth 

17
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:46,490
that's out there.
He doesn't believe that individuals can 

18
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,630
reach any sort of truth by thinking.
He certainly doesn't believe that we can

19
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,870
move towards truth in dialogue because 
that's dialogic,

20
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:52,080
right?

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,580
There's none of that.
You wonder,

22
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:54,280
well,
why do the,

23
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,110
why did the postmodern types keep other 
thinkers off the campus?

24
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,360
Well,
it's not because they're afraid.

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,310
Well,
so some of them are,

26
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,910
but they used their fragility as a mask 
for their,

27
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,810
you know,
the underlying philosophical,

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,570
their underlying philosophical and 
political interests.

29
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:14,690
They do that fragmentary.
It's not like every social justice 

30
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,900
warrior is a sword carrying port 
postmodernist,

31
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:22,901
but the ideas are fragmented and 
distributed among them like they're 

32
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:25,170
distributed among a mob and if you put 
the whole mob together,

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,320
you get the whole post modernist thing 
happening at the same time and that's 

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,010
how ideas have people instead of the 
other way around.

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,580
Anyways,
forget about logic that's out the 

36
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,601
window.
That's just a construct of Western 

37
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,581
society and and the whole point of the 
construct was to oppress other people 

38
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:48,021
and to take their wealth and to 
privilege the people who live within 

39
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:52,011
that so called logic system so that they
can justify to themselves and other 

40
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:56,331
people their Predator rapaciousness 
straight and simple and that's partly 

41
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:02,541
because postmodernism was influenced by 
Marxism and of course that's what the 

42
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,020
Marxists.
Think about any situation where there is

43
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:09,021
a,
let's call it a power status 

44
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:10,941
differential.
The people at the top are only there 

45
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:11,010
because they've stole everything from 
the people at the bottom.
