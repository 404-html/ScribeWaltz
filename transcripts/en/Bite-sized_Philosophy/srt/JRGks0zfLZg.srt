1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,310
So in the,
in the garden of Eden,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,660
there's Adam and Eve,
right?

3
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:08,430
The primordial human beings,
and there is a walled garden.

4
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:10,980
That's paradise.
Paradise means walled garden.

5
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:14,520
An Eden means well watered place.
And so there's this idea that the proper

6
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:19,260
habitat of human beings is an amalgam of
social structure and nat and nature.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,630
And that's exactly right because that's 
what we live in,

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,450
right?
We live in,

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,030
we never live in nature and we never 
live in society.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,850
We live in an amalgam of society and 
nature.

11
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:32,100
That's the human environment.
So it's a walled garden.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,100
All right?
And so it's a productive,

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,710
well watered place where we could 
thrive.

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,150
It's safe and it's ruled over by a 
father figure in this particular,

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,240
in this particular story.
And that's like the,

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,060
you can think about.
That is the spirit of civilization.

17
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:49,860
That's at least one way of considering 
it.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,340
So,
um,

19
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,030
well there's a snake in the garden and 
it's there,

20
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:59,400
unbeknownst to God,
roughly speaking,

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,920
although he's,
he knows everything.

22
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:06,921
So I guess he probably knows about the 
snake to and he tells Adam and Eve not 

23
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:08,350
to interact with it,
find.

24
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,350
And they do,
and the snake wakes them up,

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,380
right?
Because when they interact with the 

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,941
snake,
they're given a fruit that opens their 

27
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:16,941
eyes and makes them aware that they're 
naked and vulnerable,

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,990
and then dooms them to work.
Well,

29
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:21,510
I'll tell you the whole story much later
in the course,

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,430
but I want to give you an overview of it
now,

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,610
but then there's this really strange 
idea that developed over the course of 

32
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,471
the development of not only Christianity
but Judaism and and a number of other 

33
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:36,150
religions that fed into the mainstream 
of Christian ideas,

34
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:41,040
including zoroastrianism.
There's an idea that that emerged across

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,100
a very long period of time that the 
snake in the garden was the same as 

36
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,740
Satan,
the source of all evil.

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,680
And as I've been trying to figure out 
for the longest period of time,

38
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,540
why in the world the manifestation of 
what's essentially a representation of a

39
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,130
predator.
So that's the snake.

40
00:01:56,131 --> 00:02:00,120
And the snake is associated with trees.
Well,

41
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,250
yes.
The reason for that in all likelihood is

42
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:04,560
that we dwelt in trees,
right?

43
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:08,220
And snakes like trees and they're around
trees and they can climb trees.

44
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,070
And the snake was a typical Predator on 
our,

45
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:12,870
on our ancient relatives,
but.

46
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,170
And so that's fine.
So you can see that that representation 

47
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,871
makes perfect sense.
There's predators that lurk in the 

48
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:20,871
garden.
Yes.

49
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:22,110
Obviously if you interact with them,
they wake you up.

50
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,740
Well they better wake you up because if 
they don't wake you up when you interact

51
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:27,090
with them,
then you get eaten.

52
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,020
So it's probably just as well to wake up
even though there's painful consequences

53
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:32,850
associated with becoming conscious.

54
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,330
And that manifests itself immediately in
the story of,

55
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,320
of,
of,

56
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,280
of Adam and eve.
But then there's this weird association.

57
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:46,281
It's,
it's very undeveloped in the biblical 

58
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:46,281
stories that,
that,

59
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:47,280
that,
that are part and parcel of this line of

60
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:52,281
thinking.
It was more like a consequence of a 

61
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:52,500
cloud of mythological stories that 
surrounded it.

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,800
But the reason for that I think is that 
imagine that what human beings we're 

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,010
trying to puzzle out was the nature of 
the Predator.

64
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,380
Okay.
So on one level of analysis,

65
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:07,381
the predators,
the thing that links along the ground 

66
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:07,381
and the threatens you.
And also it's the thing that's your more

67
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:11,860
lending me and that wakes you up,
but then that's one conceptualization of

68
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:16,861
Predator and fair enough you can 
identify it and you can take 

69
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:20,161
precautionary measures.
But a better conceptualization of 

70
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:20,890
Predator might be where does it come 
from?

71
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,850
Let's say it's a snake,
while there's a layer of snake 

72
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,681
somewhere.
And so if we want to get rid of the 

73
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,741
snake,
we shouldn't be conceptualizing it as a 

74
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:34,651
snake,
we should be conceptualizing it as one 

75
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:37,270
manifestation of a layer of snakes.
And what we should do is go down,

76
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,330
follow the damn snake,
wherever it goes and find it's layer and

77
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:42,740
wipe out all of the snakes.
And that's,

78
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,860
that's a more abstract representation,
right?

79
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:48,100
It's not predatory anymore,
it's the source of predation.

80
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,660
And so if you want to solve the Predator
problem permanently,

81
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,560
you don't kill the snake,
you get rid of all the snakes.

82
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,640
Okay?
So fine.

83
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,710
So,
and people are pretty damn good at that.

84
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,860
And that's why you have stories of 
people like St Patrick who chased all 

85
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,341
the snakes out of Ireland and all sorts 
of saints were snake eradication saints.

86
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:11,410
And well,
there's a variety of reasons for that,

87
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,730
but then you might think,
okay,

88
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,330
well the worst Predator is the layer of 
snakes,

89
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:16,870
right?

90
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,190
But then you might think,
well wait a minute,

91
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,530
the worst Predator isn't the layer of 
snakes.

92
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,190
Maybe the worst Predator is the enemies 
that come to attack us.

93
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,790
And those are human enemies.
And so what we do is we defend ourselves

94
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,640
against the human enemies.
We put walls around our cities,

95
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:32,560
we fortify our,
our land,

96
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:36,190
and we defend ourselves against the evil
that's lurking in other people's hearts.

97
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,700
And so that's like a higher order snake.
And then we build these walls around us 

98
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,680
and what's inside gets larger and larger
and larger.

99
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,220
And then what happens is the snake 
started popping up inside the cities 

100
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,770
because you know,
we pushed all the.

101
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,980
We've,
we've protected ourselves from all the 

102
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,930
evil that lurks outside,
but we've now created a space where that

103
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:03,730
evil can manifest itself inside.
So there's criminals inside the city and

104
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:05,110
there's people who want to bring you 
down.

105
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,840
And there's malevolence within the city,
not only outside.

106
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,860
So then there's the problem of the snake
that's closer to you,

107
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,940
and then there's the ultimate problem,
which is the snake that lives in your 

108
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:17,940
heart,
right?

109
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,960
And that's each individual's capacity 
for evil.

110
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,530
And then that was conceptualized as a 
transcendent spirit,

111
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,250
right?
So that's the spirit of Satan who's the 

112
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,880
WHO's the adversary of the hero,
the adversary of the hero,

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and that's why there's an association 
between the snake in the garden.

114
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,590
And this is great series of mythologies 
about the existence of evil itself.

115
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,980
It's a consequence of our continued 
capacity to abstract.

116
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,190
We started using the Predator detection 
system to detect snakes and maybe no 

117
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,080
predatory cats and maybe birds of prey 
and all that,

118
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,230
but that didn't solve the bloody problem
because just because you hid from the 

119
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,281
predatory bird today didn't mean the 
bloody thing wasn't going to be back 

120
00:05:59,281 --> 00:05:59,420
tomorrow and tomorrow starts to matter.

121
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,300
As you get smarter,
and then once you're on that pathway and

122
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:05,600
you starting to think abstractly about 
the Predator,

123
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,710
the nature of what constitutes the 
Predator starts to become is because 

124
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,940
you're trying to solve that across all 
situations simultaneously.

125
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,690
It starts to become very much more 
abstracted.

126
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,620
It ends up being something like a 
personality,

127
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,460
like an eternal personality,
and in the internal personality that has

128
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:26,420
its effect on everyone all the time.
So and it's so.

129
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:29,780
It's so interesting to see those ideas 
because they basically evolved.

130
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,960
People did not understand those ideas as
they produced them.

131
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Right?
It was all put forward in a massive 

132
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,370
mythological context and in a rich story
context,

133
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:45,371
and the stories were as conscious as the
information got was never articulated 

134
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:50,180
past the level of story.
So remarkable.

135
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,770
Absolutely remarkable.
