00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,190
Hey Dr Peterson,
I'm curious about the connection between

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,220
aesthetic beauty and religious 
experience.

3
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:10,160
I think you've hinted at it once or 
twice over the course of the lecture.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,470
Um,
is it possible,

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,520
um,
for something that's incredibly 

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,561
beautiful to evoke or religion,
religious or mystical experience or 

7
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:23,540
something of in the same ballpark is 
that's what they're for?

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,940
Yeah.
No,

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,700
I mean if you look at the structure of 
like a,

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,740
like a renaissance cathedral was just 
going to check my,

11
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:32,580
uh,
my tag onto.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,120
I apologize you mentioned trump.
My tag onto that question.

13
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:37,600
The next part was um,
um,

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,820
is that why we have cathedral is built 
like a spectacular buildings as opposed 

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,560
to make socks or something?
Right?

16
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:43,940
Well,
it's,

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,200
if you're going to how's the ultimate 
ideal,

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,500
you build something beautiful right to,
to represent it's dwelling place and it 

19
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:56,631
should be beautiful and this is 
something that people do not take 

20
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:56,631
seriously.

21
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:58,170
And this is especially something we 
don't take seriously in Canada.

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,480
I mean,
one of the you think about,

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,620
you think about all the hundreds of 
millions of dollars that were invested 

24
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,530
into beauty in Europe,
mean spectacular,

25
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:12,060
excessive investment in beauty that's 
paid back.

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,240
God only knows how many multiples of 
times people make pilgrimages to Europe 

27
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,090
constantly because it's so beautiful 
that it just staggers you.

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,620
Beauty is so valuable and we're so 
afraid of it and I think we're afraid of

29
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:27,630
it because it does.
It's a pathway.

30
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,270
It's not the only pathway to the divine.
I mean there's lot.

31
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,870
There's pathways to the divine.
Love is one of them I suppose,

32
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,410
but beauty especially for people who 
have an affinity for,

33
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:39,000
but it's.
It's like music.

34
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:41,370
It's one of those things that you can't 
argue against,

35
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:43,290
right?
You can't even understand.

36
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:46,020
It just hits you and it does.

37
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,820
It shows you.
Well,

38
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:50,070
it shows you the ideal.
That's one way of thinking about it,

39
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:55,071
but it also shows you.
I think it's like a vision of the 

40
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,610
potential future.
It's something like that as well that if

41
00:01:56,611 --> 00:02:01,611
we just got our act together and 
beautified things that that's the place 

42
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:05,040
that we can inhabit and not winning 
noble us and that's why this Jerusalem,

43
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,430
the heavily city is paved with 
gemstones,

44
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,460
you know,
their crystalline,

45
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:13,461
the admit light and yeah,
it's the proper dwelling place for an 

46
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:17,181
enlightened consciousness.
Ut is the proper dwelling place for an 

47
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:20,421
enlightened consciousness and we,
we ignore it at our inner spiritual and 

48
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:22,000
economic peril.
It's our,

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,000
like,
it's obvious that,

50
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,380
but there's almost nothing more valuable
than but economically,

51
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,300
practically.
So yeah.

52
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,230
Why that is.
I mean,

53
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,290
I don't.
It's very.

54
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,300
Who knows.
I mean why we,

55
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,010
we experienced gemstones for example,
is beautiful.

56
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:44,370
It's very mysterious,
but they're deep reasons for it.

57
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,190
So.
Yep.
