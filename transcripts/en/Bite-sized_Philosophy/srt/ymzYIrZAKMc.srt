1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,180
And so Pinocchio was left without the 
guidance of conscience and the cricket 

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,490
is trying to figure out how to get off 
pleasure island back.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,850
He goes through the gates and he sees 
what's actually going on and what's 

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,351
going on is that the coach when has this
like slave boat down in the bowels of 

5
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:24,111
the island and he's got all these,
these black suited minions with the 

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,070
glowing eyes working for him and they're
rounding up what looked like donkeys.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,160
And so they're are beasts of burden,
right?

8
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:34,970
And so there's an idea here that if you 
produce,

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,580
if you pursue impulsive pleasure to the 
detriment of the development of your 

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,331
character,
you're going to end up a beast of 

11
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:46,521
burden.
You're going to end up a slave to a 

12
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:46,521
tyrant.
And that's exactly right.

13
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,870
And so anyways,
put other cricket doesn't.

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,900
You can see one of those black suited 
horrors here,

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,950
hauling donkeys out of this crate and 
one of them has a hat on and they look 

16
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:00,510
very sad and they're in different 
crates.

17
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,310
And one of them says sold to the salt 
mines.

18
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:05,760
And one says sold to the circus.
And so they're shipped off to be,

19
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,670
to be slaves,
roughly speaking,

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,410
and they look very sad and then one of 
them gets hauled out of a crate and he's

21
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:16,590
still got a hat.
He has a hat on and a sweater and he can

22
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:18,690
still talk.
He's a boy.

23
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,680
It turns out that's been half 
transformed into a jackass,

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,740
abrading jackass prior to being 
enslaved.

25
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:30,741
And so that's,
that's another thing that's quite 

26
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:30,741
interesting about the story.
You know,

27
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:30,741
it,
it,

28
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:34,670
it also makes the case that if you 
replace your voice with stupid brain,

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,160
that the probability that you're going 
to become enslaved by a tyrant is 

30
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,941
extraordinarily high.
And I always can't help but think about 

31
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:46,530
idiot idiot logs in that manner.
You know,

32
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,070
Solzhenitsyn wrote about the radical 
left ideologues that got thrown in the 

33
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,070
Gulag archipelago,
you know,

34
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,760
so they were part party stalwarts.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,760
This happened to a lot of people,
true believers who are vacuumed up by 

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,780
the in this machine and thrown in,
thrown into the ghoulag anyways.

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,200
And he said that those people suffered 
in some ways more than everyone else 

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,671
because what did he say?
They were bit by the beloved hand that 

39
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:11,970
fed them and so the first while when 
they were in the camps,

40
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:14,790
socialism really didn't know what to do 
with people like that because on the one

41
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:19,791
hand while they were in the camps and 
wasn't that awful and they'd been torn 

42
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,930
away from their families and you know,
stripped of all their identity and their

43
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:26,931
status and so that's pretty rough.
But on another hand they were writing 

44
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:31,431
letters,
protesting their innocence and assuming 

45
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:33,621
that everyone else in the camp was 
guilty but they were innocent and they 

46
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,090
were still strident believers in the 
communist process.

47
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,170
And so,
you know,

48
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:40,680
it was a conundrum.
Here they are being terribly punished,

49
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:42,630
but by the same token,
there are also.

50
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:45,390
The perpetrators have their own demise.
So how do you deal with them?

51
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:50,391
And they used to play comrades.
He said they used to play comrades with 

52
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:54,321
people like that and invite them into an
ideological discussion about the camp 

53
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:59,200
situation and the situation in the 
country as a whole and let them rattle 

54
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:04,230
out their idiot logical justifications 
for everything that had happened in,

55
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,000
in trying to make them parody 
themselves.

56
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Roughly speaking,
it was a rough game and Solzhenitsyn 

57
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,300
also concluded that

58
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,480
there is no helping someone like that 
when they were still ensconced inside 

59
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,801
that brain ideology.
You can predict everything they were 

60
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:25,260
going to say.
It's like someone had a crank,

61
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,740
you could just crank it and out would 
come the proper radiological formulas,

62
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,960
but then he realized that as soon as 
they,

63
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,420
let's call it,
repented of that and started to realize 

64
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,220
their own role in it or the era of the 
system,

65
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,370
then he would start communicating with 
them.

66
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,690
You know,
as if they were people who who you could

67
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:47,280
communicate with.
Yeah,

68
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,830
so that was very interesting as far as 
I'm concerned.

69
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:52,410
Anyways,
this kid is still a little bit human.

70
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:57,411
He starts to cry for his mom and the 
coachman basically throws them back into

71
00:03:57,451 --> 00:03:59,310
the crate and says that he's not ready 
yet,

72
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,110
and the reason for that is that he could
still.

73
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,990
He still had the power of independent 
speech.

74
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,440
You remember right at the beginning of 
the movie when the Mouse was painted on 

75
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,330
Pinocchio,
we saw that mask that was really glaring

76
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:16,440
at the process and I said that character
recurs continually throughout the movie.

77
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:18,870
And here's a good example of that 
because the coach,

78
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:21,810
when is the enemy of anything that has 
its own voice.

79
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,450
So he's the anti Japan.
Oh,

80
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,650
that's a good way of thinking about it.
He's the tyrannical aspect of the,

81
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,080
of the culture,
but as in so far as one of these mostly 

82
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:34,530
donkeys,
mostly jackasses can still talk.

83
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,440
Then they're not completely fit for 
slavery.

84
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:43,190
And you remember this movie was being 
made at about the same time that the 

85
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:45,930
Nazi transformation of Germany was 
taking place.

86
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:48,930
And so all these terrible underground 
things,

87
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,990
you know this,
this process whereby people were being 

88
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,411
reduced to two ideological slave say and
in this terrible process that was all 

89
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:03,381
playing out in Europe in a very big way.
And it's not like people weren't aware 

90
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,190
of that,
you know,

91
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,590
it was in there.
So

92
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,770
any ways that the donkey's,
the Jack asses that can still talk,

93
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:19,771
her crying and complaining and repenting
and the coachman turns into a full Kyron

94
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,880
again in cracks the whip,
if I remember correctly,

95
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:25,430
and says you've had your fun and now 
you're going to pay for it.

96
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,060
So the cricket gets word of all this.
He gets wind of it.

97
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:34,061
He starts to understand what's happened 
is that all these bad kids were enticed 

98
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:35,960
out onto this island so that they could 
be enslaved.

99
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,920
And he's really taken aback by that to 
say the least.

100
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,770
But he realizes what's going on.
So He runs back to find Pinocchio.

101
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,790
And then the scene switches back to the 
eight ball bar where I'm lamp wick is 

102
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:53,000
drinking beer and complaining about what
the conscience said,

103
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,470
you know,
cause he's kind of guilty,

104
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,630
I'm ashamed,
but he won't admit it because he doesn't

105
00:05:56,631 --> 00:05:58,010
admit he knows everything.

106
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,440
He's not going to admit anything about 
himself that isn't perfect.

107
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,680
He's a real totalitarian in training and
he drinks this beer and he's laughing 

108
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:07,820
about the conscious and putting them 
down.

109
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,500
And then he says,
well,

110
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,430
what?
What is,

111
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,930
what does he say?
Exactly?

112
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,020
What does he think?
I am a jack ass or something like that.

113
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,340
Maybe that's not the words.
Exactly.

114
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:20,510
And then he grows these,
these ears from Pinocchio,

115
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,840
sees that and immediately takes a look 
at the beer and stops drinking it.

116
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,320
And then land put transformers one more 
time and his face turns into the face of

117
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:31,400
a donkey.
And he's laughing still.

118
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,350
And then his,
his hands.

119
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,710
Oh yes.
He laughs suddenly starts to bray like 

120
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,710
a,
like a jackass.

121
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,611
And he's horrified by that.
And then Pinocchio laughs and the brain 

122
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:47,561
comes out as well.
And so now they're absolutely horrified 

123
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:47,600
and lampock actually figures out what's 
going on.

124
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,600
He figures out that he's been tricked 
and that he's transforming and he's 

125
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,740
completely horrified by it.
He becomes conscious of what's happening

126
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:59,741
to them.
And there's one particularly I would 

127
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:02,081
say,
dramatic scene where his hands have 

128
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:03,590
transformed in hooves and he's kicking 
in and,

129
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,990
and,
and a leaping around the room and panic 

130
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,520
and he comes up to a mirror and sees 
himself as a Jack Ass.

131
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,140
And then he turns around and breaks the 
mirror.

132
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,400
And so,
you know,

133
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,460
he self conscious for a moment.
Then he destroys his capacity for self 

134
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,760
consciousness that he transforms 
entirely into a jackass.

135
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,040
He's farther down the road than 
Pinocchio.

136
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,520
And he comes crawling to Pinocchio to 
save him and asks that the conscience 

137
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,880
comes back so that he can get out of 
this.

138
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:33,881
But of course it's a bit too late.
And so then UN occhio grows jackass ears

139
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,790
and he's absolutely terrified by it as 
well.

140
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,500
He knows what's coming and the cricut 
comes back and,

141
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,880
and guides them off.
Pleasure island.

142
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,650
And so then they end up on a cliff,
because this is an island after all,

143
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,870
they have to jump into the unknown,
right out of this impulsive adolescent 

144
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,360
hedonic playground into the unknown.
And that's how they escape.
