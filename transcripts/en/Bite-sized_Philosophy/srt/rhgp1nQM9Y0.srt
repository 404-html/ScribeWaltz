1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,630
So anyways,
Pinocchio was transformed into a victim 

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,361
and he's offered this,
he's offered this identity and he takes 

3
00:00:08,361 --> 00:00:08,610
it.
Now,

4
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:11,550
it's partly because he's deceived and 
manipulated,

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,910
but it's also partly because of the fox 
offers him the abandonment of 

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,351
responsibility as payment for as payment
for adopting the victim identity.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,400
So this is where his own lack of 
morality,

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,410
let's say,
because this is all about Pinocchio.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,890
Development as a character plays a role 
in his demise.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,970
So if I'm a victim than everyone else 
owes me something and I don't have to 

11
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,520
take any responsibility.
And so one of the things I've wondered,

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,060
here's something to think about.
It might be that the sense of meaning 

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,070
that life can provide to you is 
proportionate to the amount of 

14
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,950
responsibility you decide to take on.
Not.

15
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:54,720
That'd be very strange if it was the 
case,

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:59,721
you know,
because responsibility of course is a 

17
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:01,461
kind of weight obviously,
and it's difficult to take on 

18
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,491
responsibility,
but if any positive emotion that you 

19
00:01:04,491 --> 00:01:08,991
feel and your control of anxiety and the
control over pain is dependent on the 

20
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:14,160
activation of these systems that watch 
you move towards a desired goal,

21
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,870
then the more complete and weighty the 
goal is,

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,140
the more kicked there's going to be in 
the observation that you're moving 

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,140
towards it.

24
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,140
And,
uh,

25
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,320
you know,
you kinda already know this because 

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,220
you'll,
you'll have observed in your own life 

27
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:31,220
that when you're engaged in something 
that you believe in,

28
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,820
that the time passes properly,
you know,

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,880
you can see this even if you're,
maybe you're reading a paper and it's 

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,451
actually related in some intelligible 
manner to something that you want to 

31
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:46,020
learn.
So even though it's difficult,

32
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,120
you get engaged in it,
you can remember it better,

33
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:53,121
you can process it better and you don't.
You're not so likely to fall asleep and 

34
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:54,780
you're not so likely to want to find 
distractions.

35
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,320
All of that,
you can get into it and it would be very

36
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:02,010
interesting if that was proportionate to
the degree of responsibility that you're

37
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:04,860
willing to shoulder and I think you can 
make a strong case for that.

38
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,540
I've also often wondered,
imagine you could offer people a choice.

39
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,460
Here's the choice.
You could say,

40
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:14,490
well,
your life isn't meaningful.

41
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:19,491
Denialists have got it right.
There's no meaning in your life and 

42
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:23,060
because of that,
there's no reason for you to accept any 

43
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,311
responsibility so you can live a 
responsibility for your life and maybe 

44
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:28,410
one of the impulsive pleasure seeking 
better responsibility,

45
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,810
free life,
but the price you pay is that it doesn't

46
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:33,810
get to be meaningful.
Or you could say to someone,

47
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:35,220
no,
we're going to do the opposite.

48
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,260
We're going to say you can live a 
meaningful life,

49
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,830
but it's only going to be as meaningful 
as the amount of responsibility that 

50
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,190
you're willing to bear.
And then you might say,

51
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:45,810
well,
what would people choose?

52
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,170
Because everybody also always makes 
noises about wanting to have a 

53
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,830
meaningful life,
but if the price you pay for that is the

54
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:57,831
adoption of responsibility that it's not
so obvious that people would choose 

55
00:02:57,831 --> 00:02:58,440
meaning over,
you know,

56
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,500
over pointless pursuits if they had to,
if the benefit they go out for choosing 

57
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:10,171
the pointless pursuits was that they 
really didn't have to care about 

58
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:10,171
anything they ever did.

59
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:11,140
Right?
Snow responsibility.

60
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,090
And that's really what Pinocchio is 
offered.

61
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,830
And that's what the coachman offers 
them.

62
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:18,540
And that's interesting because,
you know,

63
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,330
so far it's been the Fox and the cat and
they were kind of to bid hoods.

64
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:27,331
And so the pathological pathway that 
they offer Pinocchio is not the worst of

65
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:29,620
the pathological pathways,
but here,

66
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,920
at least as far as the imagination,
the collective imagination that created 

67
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,731
this movie is concerned,
is this is where you get to the most 

68
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:40,210
pathological form of,
let's call it temptation.

69
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,330
And that's the temptation to engage in,
to abandon responsibility and to engage 

70
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:51,331
in impulsive,
pleasure seeking short term pleasure 

71
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:56,011
seeking.
So here's the Fox pretending to be a 

72
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:56,011
doctor investigating,
um,

73
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,710
Pinocchio's illness.
And He makes some notes,

74
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:04,711
which is all just meaningless,
scribbled,

75
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,590
right?
It's like white noise and it doesn't 

76
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,011
matter that the arguments that he's 
making is are completely incoherent and 

77
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:15,100
it doesn't matter that he actually 
doesn't know anything.

78
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:20,101
He what he's selling is easy to buy.
And so Pinocchio buys it and by the end 

79
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,840
of the conversation with the Fox,
he's pretty convinced that he's useless 

80
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,140
and it needs a vacation.
No,

81
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,460
this is anita postage inedible situation
as well,

82
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,640
which I touched on the other lecture.
I mean,

83
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,600
that's fair.
Let's imagine that you have a child that

84
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,750
is a little on the neurotic side,
so high negative emotion and maybe one 

85
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,330
that's also a little bit on the east 
side,

86
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:53,440
so has a variety of,
let's say relatively minor ailments,

87
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:58,441
but the ailments nonetheless.
So what that means as a parent will say,

88
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,430
mother,
for this example,

89
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:05,020
because I want to use the apple example,
you have to make a decision all the time

90
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,030
about exactly how you're going to treat 
that child.

91
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,760
One decision is,
well,

92
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:14,761
I'm not gonna.
You don't have to go to school today 

93
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:16,450
because you're not feeling well.
It's like fair enough,

94
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,980
but do you make the same decision the 
next day and do you make the same 

95
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,491
decision the next day and let's imagine 
that you enable the child to avoid 

96
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:29,830
responsibility as a consequence of 
capitalizing on their illness.

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,190
Well then that's not going to be very 
good for the child.

98
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,060
The rule within a sickly child has to be
something like,

99
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,270
I'm going to push you right to your 
limit because otherwise,

100
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,940
how is the person going to figure out 
what they can do?

101
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,340
And if they can't figure out what they 
can do,

102
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,400
then you're not going to be able to make
their way in the world at all.

103
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,510
And then that gets muddied very badly.
If you're not exactly sure that you want

104
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,070
them to make their way in the world.
You know,

105
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,250
maybe you're just as happy because you'd
be sitting at home alone if your child 

106
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,431
was there with you and maybe you'd be 
just as happy at some level if they 

107
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:05,150
never grew up at all because then they 
won't leave.

108
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:11,410
And so,
and maybe that's because you have a 

109
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:11,410
terrible marriage and your lonesome.
You know,

110
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,820
maybe it's an abusive marriage and your 
husband has chased away all your friends

111
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,850
and so you don't have anything at all 
and maybe that's because he didn't stand

112
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:19,880
up for yourself very well apart from the
fact that he was,

113
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,240
you know,
tyrannical and is central nature and so 

114
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,601
then all those little warps and bends in
your psyche are going to manifest 

115
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:28,760
themselves.

116
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,620
Right,
right.

117
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:33,020
In the background of every single one of
those decisions.

118
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,390
My daughter had a lot of illnesses when 
she was an adolescent and they were very

119
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:44,530
serious and it was very difficult to 
figure out what to do about that because

120
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,770
you couldn't exactly apply normative 
rules.

121
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:52,771
Right.
And we always had to figure out if she 

122
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:52,771
was

123
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:57,640
communicating her symptoms to us,
how seriously to take those and dancer 

124
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,900
was the least amount of serious 
possible.

125
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,440
It's something like that because we 
needed to do and she needed to know what

126
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:08,690
she could do in spite of the fact that 
she had problems.

127
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,690
And one of the things I really tried to 
instill in her,

128
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,500
and I think it worked,
is that you don't ever want to use it 

129
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,200
your illness as an excuse for not doing 
anything,

130
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,150
not consciously.
You know,

131
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,010
sometimes you might not know,
I'm not feeling well.

132
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:22,940
How?
What can I do?

133
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,110
What you don't know,
right?

134
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,810
Because sometimes when you're not 
feeling well,

135
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:31,811
you can do more than you think.
And sometimes you can do less than you 

136
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:31,811
think.
It's not like it's obvious,

137
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:35,950
but sometimes it's obvious.
You know this little temptation flits 

138
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:35,950
through your mind and you think,
well,

139
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,630
I don't really want to do what I'm doing
today and I'm not feeling very well so I

140
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:39,530
don't have to do it.

141
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,740
You do that 100 times.
Then you don't know how sick you are 

142
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,501
anymore and then you're.
Then you're in real trouble because not 

143
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,260
only are you sick,
but you actually have.

144
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,160
You've muddied the waters and so you 
have both problems.

145
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:57,161
That is you're actually ill and you've 
betrayed yourself by using that as an 

146
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:02,050
excuse not to pursue your 
responsibilities and not.

147
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:07,051
I think if you do both of those,
both of those things happened to you at 

148
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:10,241
the same time.
You're in real trouble and it's really 

149
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,180
hard not to have that happen.
So anyways,

150
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,330
I know gail gets enticed into believing 
that he's the victim.

151
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,080
The fact that he's insufficient is used 
as an excuse by the Fox and the and the 

152
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:25,040
cat to offer him a trip to pleasure 
island,

153
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:30,130
and this is,
I think where the movie gets 

154
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:30,130
particularly dark and so off they go 
singing away.

155
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,410
They have to carry them.
So you could say,

156
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:38,411
in some sense,
he's carried by societal pathology and 

157
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:41,861
his own trouble.
He's carried like a puppet off to 

158
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:41,861
pleasure island.
