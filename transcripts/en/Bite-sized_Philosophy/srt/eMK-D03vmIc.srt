1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,840
One of the Kennedy's genius boys came up
with the cars,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,960
Kennedy's administration was run by a 
lot of Harvard graduates and Ivy League 

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:08,960
graduates,
and so,

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,851
you know,
they were supposed to be pretty 

5
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:15,081
intelligent,
but intelligence and wisdom are not the 

6
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:15,081
same thing,
but anyways,

7
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:19,450
um,
they established a policy which was 

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,520
called mutual assured destruction,
which means if you hit me,

9
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:25,521
I kill you and then you kill me.
And so it'd be better if we just didn't 

10
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:26,820
bother.
And the acronym was mad,

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,860
right?
Mutual assured destruction.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,630
It's like,
you know,

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,890
just thinking about that it,
it's a chilling thought.

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,790
It's like what horrible entity thought 
that up as a joke.

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,440
You know,
when you think,

16
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,390
well,
does that sum.

17
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,890
It says that some politicians,
ib of width,

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,360
like where'd that come from?
So that's a hell of a thing to make a 

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,360
joke about,
you know,

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,560
mad.

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,570
Well that was right.
It was definitely mad,

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,400
you know.
And the,

23
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,790
the,
the odd thing is,

24
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,090
is that we didn't blow ourselves up and 
we didn't have a third World War.

25
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:58,170
And you know,
you,

26
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,250
you can't make a solid claim that the 
invention of nuclear weapons was 

27
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,160
necessarily the worst thing that could 
have happened,

28
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,460
you know,
because even the Soviets who were 

29
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,111
completely insane,
and of course the model was to probably 

30
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:15,411
even worse,
they weren't insane enough to start a 

31
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:15,780
nuclear war.
Now style it,

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,500
there's evidence,
there is debate about it,

33
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,530
but there was an.
There's evidence that Stalin was 

34
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:24,530
basically murdered partly by cruise 
ship,

35
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,590
was who was his,
who was his successor when Stalin died,

36
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,770
Khrushchev and three other people were 
in his house and what happened in 

37
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:33,810
Stalin's house the night he died is not 
clear,

38
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,080
but I read a book recently called 
stolen.

39
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,110
Interestingly enough,
that was written by a guy who had access

40
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:43,830
to the full communist party archives,
which was relatively new thing.

41
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,160
And that was his conclusion.
And he also believed that Stalin was 

42
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,330
gearing up to do it,
an invasion of Europe and that he didn't

43
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:55,390
give a damn how many cities would have 
to be bombed in order for the Soviets to

44
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:56,820
rule through.
And Stalin.

45
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,050
He was like that,
you know,

46
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,170
Stalin was perfectly capable of taking 
entire nations of people out in eastern 

47
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,690
Europe by train and shipping them out to
Siberia in the middle of the winter with

48
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,930
nothing to eat and no tools and letting 
them live,

49
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,210
which of course they didn't.
And that meant women,

50
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,260
children,
men,

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,860
you know,
shorn of all their belongings and thrust

52
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:18,830
out into the middle of nowhere to perish
or,

53
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,940
or,
or live as they saw fit and if they 

54
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,361
perished so much,
the better as far as Stalin was 

55
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:26,361
concerned.

56
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:26,850
And so he wasn't exactly the sort of 
person,

57
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,660
the idea of a nuclear war would 
necessarily stop.

58
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:33,480
And it's certainly possible that that's 
what he was hoping for.

59
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,650
You know,
because when we look at people like 

60
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:39,650
Stalin and Hitler,
we think,

61
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:39,650
well,
you know,

62
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,380
thereafter world domination,
you know,

63
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:45,381
and you think,
well in some sense that's kind of a 

64
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:45,381
positive motivation,
right?

65
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:45,750
I mean,
not really,

66
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,350
but it's like if you have a corvette say
and someone steals it,

67
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:50,010
you can think,
well,

68
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:52,620
I know why they stole it.
They want to have the corvette.

69
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:53,180
You know,
it's,

70
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,030
it's an understandable motivation to 
want power.

71
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,300
It's not necessarily an admirable one.
Sometimes power is a perfectly 

72
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,881
reasonable thing to pursue,
but I don't have any idea why we ever 

73
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,180
assume that those guys were after 
victory.

74
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Like you should never make the 
presupposition that everyone is out to 

75
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,850
when some people are out to lose and the
more people they can take with them,

76
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:16,420
the better.

77
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,130
You know.
And when Hitler died,

78
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,310
he committed suicide in a bunker way 
down below Berlin.

79
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:23,350
West Berlin was on fire and Europe was 
burning.

80
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:24,730
It's like,
as far as I can tell,

81
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,640
that was exactly what Hitler was after 
right from the beginning.

82
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,820
You know,
he was interested in fire as a purifying

83
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:31,850
agent.
You know,

84
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,870
he's a fire worship or in some sense 
because if you look at the Nuremberg 

85
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,420
gatherings of the Nazis,
you know,

86
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,300
they're spectacular,
spectacular celebrations,

87
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,480
unbelievably dramatic and impressive.
And they frequently featured fire and 

88
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,310
fire's up purifying agent know,
and Hitler,

89
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:53,311
by the end of World War Two was he was 
pretty contemptuous of the Germans 

90
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:55,360
because they really hadn't served him 
well.

91
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,840
That it wasn't like he thought,
well maybe it wasn't such a good idea to

92
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:00,530
start a whole second world war,
you know,

93
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,920
because he was a little on the 
narcissistic side we might say,

94
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,720
but by the time the Russians came 
marching in Germany was in ruins.

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,840
Hitler was perfectly happy to have the 
allies tromp all over the citizens 

96
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,450
because that's what they deserved 
anyways.

97
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,600
And so that's the sort of guy he was.
And so why we would assume that he 

98
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,740
wanted to win just because that's what 
he said is something I'd never been able

99
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,450
to understand.
You know,

100
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,850
the kids who shot up columbine didn't 
want to win.

101
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,630
I wanted to kill as many people as 
possible to make a point and then they 

102
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,380
wanted to kill themselves just in case 
you didn't exactly get the point.

103
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,100
And the point was the more destruction 
the battery and if I have to go along 

104
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,100
with it,
hey,

105
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,360
no problem.
That just makes me a little bit more 

106
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,491
serious than I might've otherwise be.
And so those sorts of motivations are 

107
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:48,691
not pleasant to understand,
but we have enough documentation about 

108
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:49,900
events like that,
you know,

109
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,400
especially the mass killings.

110
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,710
Those guys have written down exactly why
they do it.

111
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,010
Now.
I have some excellent books on 

112
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,850
extraordinary vengeful,
a map serial killers that mass murders.

113
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:05,851
I know exactly how they think.
There's a great book if you're 

114
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:05,851
interested in this sort of thing called 
pans,

115
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:10,060
Ram p a n Zed r a,
m and Carl Pants.

116
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:15,061
Ram was a serial killer and rapist who 
lived pretty much early in the 20th 

117
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:17,380
century.
And he was a tough delinquency sorta kid

118
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,390
from a large family.
And when he was,

119
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,590
you know,
13,

120
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:23,350
14,
they sent them off to some reform school

121
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:28,351
and it was really run by the same sort 
of people that run Canada's residential 

122
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:31,981
schools and you know,
so those were basically predators on 

123
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:32,860
children.
And of course he was raped and,

124
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,030
and,
and,

125
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,870
and brutalized and tormented and in all 
sorts of horrible ways.

126
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,790
And,
but he was a tough guy.

127
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,130
And when he came out he decided that,
you know,

128
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,050
the human race really wasn't worth that 
much.

129
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:47,830
And that he was going to reek as much 
mayhem as he possibly could for the rest

130
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:50,140
of his life.
He raped a thousand men.

131
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,120
He killed dozens of people.
He kept track of the dollar value of the

132
00:05:55,121 --> 00:06:00,121
buildings.
He burned down like this was a serious 

133
00:06:00,121 --> 00:06:03,371
guy and he wasn't.
He was bent on destruction and that's 

134
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:05,810
that when he was.
What were his dying words?

135
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,360
First of all,
there was a committee,

136
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,150
I believe,
of women who intervened on behalf of him

137
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:14,450
because they were anti capital 
punishment.

138
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,600
And he said to them,
if I remember correctly,

139
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:22,601
that he wished the human race had one 
neck so that he could put his hands 

140
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:22,940
around it and squeeze.
So you know,

141
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:27,941
that was his way of pointing out to the 
people who didn't think that maybe 

142
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:31,990
capital punishment was justified in his 
case that maybe they weren't thinking 

143
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,720
clearly.
And then to the hang man,

144
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:34,700
he said,
hurry up you who's your bastard?

145
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:37,340
I could kill 10 men in the time it takes
you to hang me.

146
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,550
So you know,
you don't get a statement like that from

147
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:42,950
someone who isn't thoroughly committed 
to what he's doing.
