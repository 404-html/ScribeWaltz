1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,270
Piaget was very interested in how you 
produce structures that enable you to 

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:07,550
regulate yourself because you're like a 
kind of a,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,830
a colony of strange sub animals that 
have to figure out how to get along so 

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,121
that you can sort of be one thing.
You kind of learned that I would say 

5
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:18,900
between the ages of two and four as 
you're being socialized,

6
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:20,790
you know,
how erratic two year olds are.

7
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:25,791
I mean,
they're a blast and it's part because 

8
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:25,791
they were erratic.
It's like they're unbelievably happy and

9
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:29,040
then they're unbelievably hungry and 
then they're really hot and then they're

10
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,930
really upset and crying,
you know?

11
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,490
And then they're really scared.
It's like,

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,790
and all of that just untrammeled.
And so it's really fun to be around 

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,511
them,
especially when they're happy because 

14
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:41,511
they're so happy that it's just,
you know,

15
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:42,210
you don't ever get to be that happy.

16
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,630
And so it's nice to be around the two 
year old because you can kinda feel that

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,540
again,
you know,

18
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:51,090
and a lot of what the.
One of the horrible things about being a

19
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:56,091
parent is that you spend a tremendous 
amount of your time making your child 

20
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:59,520
less happy.
And the reason for that is that positive

21
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:02,020
emotion is a very impulsive,
you know,

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,300
and you know because everybody says,
well,

23
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,590
you should be happy.
It's like,

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,610
well,
no,

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,070
when you're happy you're actually quite 
stupid.

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,890
And so because happiness makes you 
impulsive,

27
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,810
happiness makes happiness.
Says,

28
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,310
hey,
things are really good right now.

29
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,440
Get what you can while the getting's 
good.

30
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,310
And so as a like,
if you're hyper optimistic,

31
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,760
manic will say it's like every stock 
investment looks like a really good 

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,420
stock investment.
It's like you go to spend all your money

33
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:32,421
because look at,
there's those wonderful things 

34
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:32,600
everywhere and you could do such great 
things with them and then you know,

35
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,600
you spend all your money and then you 
crash and you think,

36
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,100
Oh God,
my life's over,

37
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:39,000
you know,
because I just,

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,570
I just spent all my money on all this 
useless stuff.

39
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,150
And it's all under the grip of 
impulsive,

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,010
positive emotion,
you know?

41
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:52,011
And so when,
when you're telling your kids to be 

42
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,120
quiet and settled down,
it isn't because they're making a lot of

43
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:59,121
noise being in pain is because they're 
running around like wild baboons having 

44
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:02,040
a blast and disrupting things like mad,
you know,

45
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,410
you got kids,
you got to settle down,

46
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:09,411
you know,
like quit having so much fun and it's 

47
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:10,560
kind of awful that you do that.
But,

48
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,610
but you do.
And that's because the emotions and the 

49
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,361
motivations have to be brought into a 
relationship with one another within the

50
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:21,960
person.
So that,

51
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,380
you know,
one thing I remember with my son who is 

52
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:27,380
quite,
he's quite disagreeable by temperament,

53
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,490
which is actually a good thing as far as
I'm concerned,

54
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:34,491
although it brings its own challenges.
And so with my daughter when she was 

55
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:38,370
misbehaving,
she was pretty agreeable and uh,

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,120
you know,
if she was misbehaving I could basically

57
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,100
just look at her and then she'd quit.

58
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,690
But my son,
it was like,

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,390
that was just nothing.
You're looking at me.

60
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:48,930
It's like,
no,

61
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:53,931
that's just not gonna go anywhere man.
And so then I'd tell them to stop and 

62
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:55,650
that really wasn't having much of an 
effect either.

63
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:58,500
He just sort of maybe laugh or runaway 
or whatever.

64
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:01,930
I mean he was a tough little rat and you
know,

65
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,960
what I would do with him is he would be 
doing something and it interfered and 

66
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,530
he'd get upset and you know,
angry.

67
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:13,531
And so then I get them to sit on the 
steps and I told them this is when he 

68
00:03:13,531 --> 00:03:13,690
was about to.
I said,

69
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,040
look,
you're going to sit on the steps.

70
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:20,041
That's time out.
You're going to sit on the steps until 

71
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,621
you've got control of yourself and you 
can come back and be and play the game 

72
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:25,240
again.
I basically said,

73
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,210
be a civilized human being and then 
you're welcome again.

74
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,210
And so he'd sit on the steps.
It was so interesting to watch because 

75
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,210
he was just enraged.
He'd sit there like,

76
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:36,130
have you ever seen a two year old have a
temper tantrum?

77
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,240
It's really quite the bloody phenomena.
If you ever saw an adult do that,

78
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:42,340
you'd like,
you'd call nine one one right away.

79
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,540
And it's like,
Oh my God,

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,460
I've seen adults do that,
you know,

81
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:50,461
because people say with borderline 
personality disorder will have temper 

82
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:50,920
tantrums and it's like,
man,

83
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,410
you want to be about 30 feet away from 
that person.

84
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,760
That's for sure.
It's really.

85
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,850
But in kids it's like,
well first of all,

86
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:02,851
they're only this long.
So how much trouble can they really 

87
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:02,851
cause?
But it's like,

88
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:03,490
you know,
they're just completely gone there.

89
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:07,810
Like on the floor of their face is red.
They're just furious,

90
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:12,811
like way more furious than you ever get 
if you are even vaguely socialized 

91
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:13,450
there,
just outraged.

92
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,450
And they're kicking and hitting the 
ground and like it's like a little 

93
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,240
epileptic fit of anger,
you know,

94
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:21,550
they're completely controlled by their 
rage.

95
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:26,030
And we took care of one kid for awhile 
who he was actually a pushover,

96
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,240
that kid,
you could get them to behave by,

97
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,950
you know,
kind of shaking your finger at him.

98
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:32,740
But his mother thought he was really 
tough because he had her,

99
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,100
he had her figured out and one of the 
things he would do is have a temperature

100
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,050
temper tantrum.
And during the temper Tantrum,

101
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,470
he would hold his bloody breath until he
turned blue.

102
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,910
It's like,
try that,

103
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,980
like you know,
as that's your homework,

104
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,310
go home and go home and have a temper 
tantrum and while you're doing it,

105
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:51,100
hold your breath until you actually turn
blue.

106
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,340
It's like you won't be able to do it.
You don't have the willpower of a two 

107
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:56,340
year old now.

108
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:56,980
That's for sure.
That little varmint man,

109
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:01,981
he just have a fit.
Then he'd hold his breath and then he'd 

110
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:01,981
turned blue.
It was like,

111
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:01,981
wow,
that's,

112
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:03,510
that's amazing.
And we would just like,

113
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,540
let them do it and you know,
he turned blue and everybody would be 

114
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,430
gone and he'd come out of it,
you know,

115
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,880
and it didn't work.
So he just quit doing it.

116
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:15,310
I think he did it like twice and he 
figured out,

117
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:18,170
oh well that's a lot of work for very 
little outcome.

118
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:20,380
And you know,
it's not like two year olds are stupid.

119
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,740
They're not stupid.
They're probably smarter than you,

120
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,010
but they're not civilized by any stretch
of the imagination.

121
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:28,480
And so anyways,
back to my son,

122
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,760
I'd put them on the steps and he'd be 
like,

123
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,180
oh,
it's just like aged and trying to get 

124
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,180
himself together,
you know?

125
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,020
And I wait a few,
few,

126
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,130
I got a strict rule which was as soon as
you're done,

127
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,960
you're welcome again.

128
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,630
So it's completely under your control.
You,

129
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,360
you get yourself calmed down,
you come and talk to me again.

130
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,550
If you're calm enough.
So I like you,

131
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,460
then you're welcome back in the family.
No grudge or nothing.

132
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,460
And so it's harder than you think.
Like people think they liked their kids.

133
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:02,390
It's like don't be thinking that they're
hard to like they're little monsters and

134
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:04,220
they're very,
very pushy and provocative.

135
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,490
And so lots of parents do not like their
children and they do terrible things to 

136
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,730
them their whole life.
So it's no joke and it's a very common.

137
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:15,530
And you know,
that was Freud's observation,

138
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:20,531
fundamental observation that a lot of 
psychopathology is rooted in the family 

139
00:06:20,531 --> 00:06:21,980
and you can be sure of that.
You know when,

140
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,880
when you hear about some mother who's 
done something terrible to her child,

141
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:30,881
which happens reasonably frequently,
you know perfectly well that she has a 

142
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,060
very terrible capacity to discipline.

143
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,060
The child is just provoked or unprovoked
or provoked or unprovoked or provoked 

144
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,930
her and it just happens to be a day 
where her new boyfriend left and she's 

145
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,861
quite hungover and she got fired and 
it's like that's the wrong data 

146
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:49,240
provoker,
and then she does something that is not 

147
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,240
good and you read about it and you 
think,

148
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,060
well,
how could that happen?

149
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,530
How could anyone do that?
Well,

150
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,880
that's how they do it,
and so and kids are very provocative.

151
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:58,340
Just like little chimps.
Chimps will.

152
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,850
The adolescents will like throw little 
pebbles and sticks out the sleeping 

153
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,950
larger males and bug them and that 
teasing,

154
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,980
which it is,
that teasing turns into full fledged 

155
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:11,980
dominance,
challenged behavior.

156
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,940
Once the adolescent males get big enough
to do it,

157
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,730
and so when you're being provoked by a 
child,

158
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:19,460
which they provoke your time,
they're trying to figure out,

159
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:22,790
well,
just where are you exactly?

160
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,040
What happens if I do this?
What happens if I do this,

161
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,080
you know,
and how else are they going to figure it

162
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,700
out?
Anyways,

163
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:33,701
he'd sit on the steps and just,
it's just enraged and trying to control 

164
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:35,670
himself and I've watched that and then,
you know,

165
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,720
I come back after about two minutes or 
whatever and he'd still be around.

166
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,030
I'd say,
well are,

167
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,860
you know,
have,

168
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,480
have you got yourself under control?
Are you ready to get off the steps?

169
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,710
Go,
no,

170
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,320
not yet.
And then,

171
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,400
you know,
he'd get himself under control and then 

172
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,991
he'd come back and you know,
he'd be contrite and then I would like 

173
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:55,991
him right away.
You know,

174
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:56,780
you to watch that,
you know,

175
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:59,660
because you don't like being dominated 
by a two year old,

176
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,720
no one does.
And so if the child hasn't mastered 

177
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,840
himself and started to act in accordance
with the prevailing social norms,

178
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,390
you won't like them while you think,
oh yeah,

179
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,070
I will because you know,
I'm a good person.

180
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,520
It's like,
no,

181
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,440
you won't and no,
you're not a good person.

182
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,840
So don't be thinking about that at all.
It's just not true.

183
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,200
So when he was contrite,
then he'd come and then we just go on 

184
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:25,880
like nothing had happened because that's
what you want to do,

185
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,280
right?
As soon as you get compliance,

186
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,250
especially if the compliance is in the 
best interest of the child,

187
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,680
you want to reward it instantly,
right?

188
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,200
That's the right thing to do because so 
then,

189
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,640
and you could just see him gaining 
control over himself.

190
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:45,020
And so really what was happening is his,
in his mind,

191
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,310
in his brain will say there was a war 
between the psyche,

192
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:54,311
the ego that was starting to become 
integrated and starting to become a 

193
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:55,680
continuous person,
an identity,

194
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,280
and it's fragile in two year olds and it
can be disrupted all the time.

195
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:01,770
And it is.
That's why they're so hyper emotional.

196
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:06,771
It's fragile,
that little ego and it doesn't have a 

197
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:09,561
lot of power.
And so what you want to do is reward it 

198
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:09,561
when it wins,
you know,

199
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:11,940
it's when it,
when he gets control over the underlying

200
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:12,990
motivations,
you want to say,

201
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:14,070
hey,
good work man,

202
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,810
good work kid.
You did it.

203
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,840
You know,
you got yourself under control way to 

204
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,241
be.
And the kids really happy about that 

205
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:23,430
because it's actually not that much fun 
to have a temper tantrum.

206
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,320
It's exhausting,
you know,

207
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,580
it takes you over.
