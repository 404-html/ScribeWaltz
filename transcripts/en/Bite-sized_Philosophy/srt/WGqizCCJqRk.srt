1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,030
So no cue goes off to meet the coachman 
and the coachman has already said he's 

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,200
collecting bad little boys and he's,
he's,

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,730
he's got them on the coach,
they're all delinquent types here.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,870
The ticket on the coach was the ace of 
spades,

5
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:20,871
which is what Pinocchio is holding.
And he's with this character here called

6
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:23,520
Lamp Wick.
That's an interesting name.

7
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:28,521
So he's the,
he's the thing that Burns in the middle 

8
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:31,611
of a light lamp wick.
And that's interesting because it's a 

9
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:33,480
play on Lucifer.
Lucifer means bringer of light.

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,870
And so lamp wick is a play on that.
And lamb pork is really a nasty piece of

11
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:41,300
work.
He's got this false arrogance about him.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,340
He's got this like this cynical voice,
really deeply cynical voice and he's 

13
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,091
only,
I don't know how old he is supposed to 

14
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:50,091
be in this,
maybe 12 or something like that are 13.

15
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,880
And so he's one of those kids who's,
who's become prematurely cynical.

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,120
I'll tell you a story about that.
So I used to live in Montreal.

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,010
Um,
I lived in a poor neighborhood.

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,180
And uh,
one day I was out in the back alley 

19
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,080
building a fence because I was putting 
little fence around my back,

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,920
my little tiny backyard and there was a 
house across the alley down the street,

21
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:18,420
a ways where there is a lot of,
like not good partying.

22
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:23,550
Lot of bikers are hanging around there.
And I knew there was a little kid that 

23
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:23,970
lived there as well.
Anyways,

24
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:28,971
I was out there in the back alley 
pounding away on my fence and these 

25
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:28,971
little kids came up and they were 
little.

26
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:30,180
They were like three and four years old.
Hey.

27
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,420
And they spoke a Jew all right.
A kind of a really heavily accented 

28
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:38,580
Quebecois French and so on.
My French isn't good,

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,630
so I could hardly understand them,
but they were what they were watching me

30
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:45,390
hammer and they got a little closer and 
they had one,

31
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,610
one kid who was clearly the leader had a
real scowl on his face.

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,200
And so they were watching and I kind of 
motion to one of them that they could 

33
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,780
use the hammer.
And that kid said,

34
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,540
uh,
and I,

35
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,860
I'm gonna mangle this.
But he says you have olay or something 

36
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860
like that.
And what it meant is I'll steal that.

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,090
And so I thought,
you know,

38
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:08,091
and then he came over and he tugged on 
it and he wanted me to take it and he 

39
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:08,700
was quite angry and while I wasn't gonna
let them take it.

40
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,090
And then so,
so I couldn't engage them.

41
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,560
I couldn't get him to play,
you know,

42
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:16,950
and his buddies were sort of hanging 
around behind him and they wouldn't come

43
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:20,670
and play because he wouldn't.
So he was hostile right away to me.

44
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,270
And then so the finance piece was laying
out in the La and these little monsters 

45
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,320
started running across it,
which I thought was really remarkable,

46
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:31,740
you know.

47
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,010
But it was terrible at the same time 
because they were really little kids 

48
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,150
that shouldn't be happening when you're 
like three or four if that's happening 

49
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,150
at that age,
things are not good.

50
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,870
And so that kid was already like,
seriously not happy with the world.

51
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,470
And you know,
I'd been studying antisocial behavior 

52
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,770
for a long time by that point.
And I knew that the kids who are 

53
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,831
destined to jail later in their lives,
our kids who are rough and tough when 

54
00:02:57,831 --> 00:02:58,710
they're two years old but then don't 
get,

55
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,080
or maybe worse,
they get anti socialized,

56
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,580
which is exactly what happened to this 
kid.

57
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:08,581
He'd obviously been ignored and abused.
I'm certainly no one had ever played 

58
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,920
with them in any real way because he,
he wouldn't play.

59
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,150
And it's not good if a kid is that 
little and you can't get them to play,

60
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:21,151
something's gone seriously wrong because
they're so playful at that age that 

61
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:21,880
like,
it's like 90 percent of them.

62
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,180
Anyway.
So they were running back and forth on 

63
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,180
this fence.
I thought it stomping on it,

64
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,370
you know?
And I was right there.

65
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,140
I thought,
well,

66
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:29,650
I.
First of all,

67
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:34,651
I thought that was remarkable,
but I also thought it was absolutely 

68
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:34,651
horrifying because,
you know,

69
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:39,600
in some sense I could see where this kid
was headed and why at that early stage 

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,180
in his life,
it's really,

71
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,360
it's not a pleasant thing to behold,
you know,

72
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,190
but there was nothing that could be done
about it.

73
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,220
And that's kind of what this lamp wick 
is like.

74
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,230
He's prematurely cynical.
This kid was already cynical and he was 

75
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:52,660
like four years old,
you know,

76
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,360
most kids don't get cynical till they're
teenagers,

77
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,000
you know?
And then often they don't get completely

78
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:00,400
cynical and usually they more or less 
grow out of it.

79
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,310
But he had.
It happened him much earlier.

80
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,870
So this lamp,
what character he'd already,

81
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:09,370
he's already decided that he knows 
everything that everyone else is.

82
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,670
His opinion is worth nothing and that 
there's nothing in culture society that 

83
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,010
holds any use utility whatsoever for 
someone like him.

84
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,220
Now you can imagine developing that way 
if you were raised in a family where 

85
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,050
people were generally generally lying to
you and that they randomly treated you 

86
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,281
or neglected you and that you couldn't 
discern anything about them that was 

87
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:33,460
admirable or positive,
you know,

88
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,030
of course you'd assume that the whole 
structure is corrupt and that you had to

89
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,470
take care of yourself and no one else 
will not.

90
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:44,320
Of course not everyone assumes that 
under those situations,

91
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,400
I shouldn't say of course,
but it's a.

92
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,630
But it's a logical set of conclusions.
So.

93
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,470
And of course it's proportionate to some
degree to how much abuse you take.

94
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,740
Although there are lots of stories of 
people who've been terribly abused as 

95
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,170
children who grew up to be,
you know,

96
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,000
kind,
remarkable,

97
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,720
responsible,
thoughtful people who were absolutely 

98
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,170
opposed to abuse instead of propagating 
it.

99
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,240
There's no direct causal pathway.
