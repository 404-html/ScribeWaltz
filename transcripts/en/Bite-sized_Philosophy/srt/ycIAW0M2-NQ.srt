1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,480
Buddha's farther is visited by an angel 
who tells him that his son is going to 

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,651
grow up to be the greatest temporal 
profane ruler of the world has ever seen

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,120
or a great spiritual leader and his 
father.

4
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:17,100
Being a pragmatic and conservative man 
decides that there's no possible way.

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:22,101
I'm going to allow my son to take the 
ambivalent road of spiritual 

6
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:26,750
enlightenment.
I'm going to allow him to fall 

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,811
completely in love with the world so 
that he will remain attached to his 

8
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:33,690
domain.
So prior to Buddha's birth,

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,840
his father constructs a great city with 
walls around it and inside that city he 

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,440
removes all signs of pain,
frustration,

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,630
and disappointment.
Any sign of ugliness,

12
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:50,631
the end aids,
the only people that are allowed to 

13
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:53,600
exist within the city or those who are 
in perfect mental and physical health 

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,370
who are paragons of beauty and virtue.

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,370
And the idea that lurks behind that 
archetypal story is that when a father 

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,660
has a child,
the his moral obligation is to shield 

17
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:12,561
the developing consciousness of that 
child from contact with any of the 

18
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:16,671
horrors of life that could provide the 
child with an experience too traumatic 

19
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:22,461
for that developing consciousness to 
apprehend so because it's an archetypal 

20
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:26,481
story,
it relates to the development of all 

21
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:26,481
people,
not just the redemptive savior,

22
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:29,190
and that's the motif that the Buddhist 
story initially follows.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,280
A good father makes his child fall in 
love with life by enticing that child 

24
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,950
into a direct relationship with all that
life has to offer.

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,120
So Buddha grows up within this walled 
garden.

26
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:46,121
It's unselfconscious paradise,
but precisely because he's been shielded

27
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,170
to this degree and allowed to mature.
His consciousness continues to expand 

28
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,570
and the world outside the boundaries 
that his parents have established for 

29
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,740
him starts to attract his attention.

30
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,560
Now we know already that the forbidden 
fruit,

31
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:06,561
right?
The lawyer of what's outside the walls 

32
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:07,920
is something that human beings just 
can't keep their mangy little paws off.

33
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:11,640
Right?
We are absolutely uncontrollably curious

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,760
and the best way to make sure that we 
investigate something is to lay down a 

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,570
stricture that says whatever you do 
under whatever circumstances,

36
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,240
never look there,
right,

37
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:25,500
and then the automatic systems that 
underlie our orienting and that motivate

38
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:30,501
our seeking experience are constantly 
pulling our attention precisely to that 

39
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:34,251
forbidden spot,
compelling us to investigate exactly 

40
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:37,941
that which has been forbidden.
So because Buddha is a consciousness 

41
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:42,771
developing in a healthy manner,
he immediately becomes curious about 

42
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:47,001
what lies beyond the the limits that 
have been established with him and he 

43
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,870
makes a decision to go outside of 
Paradise.

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Right?
Which seems a particularly ridiculous 

45
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,571
thing to do given that in principle he 
has everything he could possibly want 

46
00:02:56,571 --> 00:03:00,110
inside the walls,
but then again we have the troublesome 

47
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,030
notion of the original sin of Adam,
right?

48
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:04,780
Which is that if any of you were offered
a forbidden fruit,

49
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,840
again under circumstances mythologically
equivalent to those that are obtained in

50
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:15,241
the beginning,
you'd immediately reach your hand out 

51
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:17,431
and take it.
Because what we haven't got for human 

52
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,730
beings is always far more compelling 
than what we have got.

53
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,340
So Buddha goes outside the walls,
but his father,

54
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,010
who's a good father,
although somewhat conservative,

55
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:35,011
decides he's going to rig the game a 
little bit so it gets rid of everybody 

56
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:37,660
that's diseased or unhappy or 
uncomfortable or ugly rolled or anything

57
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:40,150
that could possibly disturb the Buddha,
any lines,

58
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:45,151
the streets with flower waving women and
puts pedals on the road and census,

59
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,230
son out into gilded chariot.
But the gods who are lurking around 

60
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,641
right,
the troublemaking gods who represent 

61
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:56,020
chaos and disorder in the unknown decide
to stand in front of Buddha.

62
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,070
A sick man who hobbles unsteadily 
interview and Buddha asks,

63
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:05,071
is his retainer precisely what this 
phenomena represent sound?

64
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:07,900
His retainer says,
well,

65
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:09,850
you know,
human beings like you,

66
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:14,851
sincere human are subject to the 
deterioration of these physical powers 

67
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:19,530
in an arbitrary way.
And this man is one person who's being 

68
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:19,630
so affected.

69
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,630
And so buddha is completely disenchanted
by his exploratory move out into the 

70
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:30,301
terrible unknown and runs back into the 
castle walls and shuts the door and is 

71
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:31,300
perfectly happy to think of nothing for 
months.

72
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:35,980
But then as his anxiety habituates and 
his curiosity grows,

73
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,670
he can't stand the notion of never going
outside the walls again and outside.

74
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:44,671
He goes again and this time where after 
his father prepares the route ever so 

75
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:49,771
carefully,
the godsend insight and old man who 

76
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:52,891
hobbles interview and mood,
it looks at him in shock and horror and 

77
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:55,780
says to his retainer,
just precisely what's going on here.

78
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,670
And His retainer says,
well,

79
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,320
that's an old man and everybody gets old
and you're going to get old too.

80
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:06,930
And that's the way of all humanity.
And that's the point at which voted.

81
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,980
Self consciousness expands not to only 
include the possibility of degeneration,

82
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:16,930
but to include the temporal horizon 
that's characteristic of life.

83
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,930
And he finds that so terribly shocking 
that he runs back into the castle and 

84
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,880
shuts the walls down and plays with his 
friends for another six months,

85
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,850
maybe a year till his anxiety.
Finally habituates.

86
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:31,130
And he goes out one final time.
And this time the godsend,

87
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,160
a funeral parade for him and he sees his
first dad body.

88
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:41,161
And this is such a terrible shock to him
that he can't even go back to the 

89
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:44,941
castle.
So his father prepares for him a great 

90
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,690
party in the woods near the castle full 
of nude dancing.

91
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:51,691
Women who are perfectly willing to 
flaunt themselves into offer themselves 

92
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:55,171
to him.
But Buddha is so absolutely 

93
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:57,550
catastrophic,
really shocked by this notion of 

94
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,911
emergent death,
that he can't take any pleasure 

95
00:05:59,911 --> 00:05:59,911
whatsoever and what's being offered to 
him.

96
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:02,570
And he leaves the kingdom once and for 
all.

97
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,470
And you think,
well,

98
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,780
that's exactly what happens to you when 
you grow up.

99
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,690
Right?
If you're reasonably well socialized and

100
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:13,691
properly looked after,
then your curiosity gets the better of 

101
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:16,451
you and you keep going out into the 
world until what year parents have 

102
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:18,050
established for you is no longer 
sufficient for you.

103
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,870
And as a consequence of that movement 
own into the world,

104
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,280
you find out all sorts of things 
characteristic of your own life that not

105
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:28,290
only your parents can't precisely 
explained to you,

106
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,460
but even the broader formal structures 
of your culture have a very difficult 

107
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,441
time handling.
And when you finally do encounter such 

108
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:41,651
realities and allow their effect on you 
to fully manifest itself well then 

109
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,160
you're finally independent and you no 
longer can return home,

110
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,310
but from that point forward,
you are also burdened as Adam is 

111
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,061
burdened when he loses his Paradise Hill
unselfconscious snus with the full 

112
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:58,310
revelation of what it means to be 
limited and alive.

113
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
So what happens to Buddha as a 
consequence of this revelation,

114
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,270
he becomes an apprentice and the 
chronicles of the Buddhist adventure are

115
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:13,331
careful to say that he becomes the 
world's most proficient practitioner of 

116
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:18,851
Sam [inaudible],
which was a philosophical precursor to 

117
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:21,941
yoga and then to yoga so he masters all 
the positions and the asanas until he's 

118
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,710
disciplined physically to an almost 
unlimited degree.

119
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,850
And then he decides that he'll adopt a 
stance of world renunciation,

120
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:31,010
which is also something he's a 
remarkably good at,

121
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,250
and he starved himself until the chronic
lewis say he resembles nothing so much 

122
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,420
as a pile of dust and then having 
exhausted all the disciplinary 

123
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,700
structures that his sophisticated 
culture has to offer him,

124
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:47,810
but still not precisely finding the 
answer that he's looking for.

125
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,930
He retreats into the forest,
a place of the unknown and sits himself 

126
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,190
at the base of a tree underneath the 
tree.

127
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:00,190
He's visited by visions and temptations.
The first vision is an essentially 

128
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,451
erotic one life itself,
camps him back out of his self conscious

129
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:07,430
state into the domain of pure physical 
pleasure,

130
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,620
a perfectly reasonable temptation,
right,

131
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,920
and one that's powerful enough so that 
Hindu philosophers say,

132
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,460
b,
as their churches and cathedrals are 

133
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,891
covered with erotic drawings.
If you can't get past the erotic 

134
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:24,521
drawings into the church,
that's the domain that you should still 

135
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:27,581
inhabit,
right in the dawning phases of life at 

136
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:30,641
least till middle age.
That's the appropriate motive being to 

137
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:33,050
be enticed and seduced by the physical 
pleasures that life has to offer,

138
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,200
but in the final analysis,
those are not sufficient to solve the 

139
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,510
problem of emergent self consciousness 
and so the angel of death visits him and

140
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:46,511
offered him the opportunity to exist 
permanently in a state of Nirvana.

141
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,990
Very,
very interesting twist on the story 

142
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,061
because you have to wonder,
given the association saved between 

143
00:08:55,061 --> 00:08:58,230
suicidality and the notion of paradise 
that exists underneath that.

144
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,290
If what Buddha isn't being offered by 
the angel of death is in fact death and 

145
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,940
the cessation of all the problems of 
being regardless,

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
he rejects that attains enlightenment 
briefly and then decides to return to 

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,640
the world to share what he's discovered 
with all of suffering humanity.

The idea being that the Buddha who is 
the awakened or enlightened one,

149
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,800
is capable of attaining a transcendent 
state,

150
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:27,801
but also knows fully that because human 
beings have a shared social aspect,

151
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,400
it is not possible for any one person to
attain redemption until all people 

152
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,931
attain redemption.
The reason being that it's very 

153
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:41,901
difficult to be transcendent and 
enlightened when you see someone who's 

154
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:42,810
sick lying in a ditch.
