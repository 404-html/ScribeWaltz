1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,540
You know what,
one of the things that I've been struck 

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,500
very hard by a number of writers,
Carl Young,

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,780
obviously among them,
I mean he,

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,260
he wrote things like Nicha that if you 
understand them,

5
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:15,090
they just break you into pieces,
you know,

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,510
and,
and one of the things that young 

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,611
understood in the psychoanalysts 
understand it's one of the most 

8
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:25,071
terrifying elements of psychoanalytic 
thinking is very tightly allied with 

9
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:29,240
religious thinking,
which is that you are not the master of 

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,151
your own house.
There are spirits that dwelling within 

11
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:35,721
you,
meaning you have a will and you can 

12
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:38,340
exercise a certain amount of conscious 
control over your being,

13
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:43,341
but there are all sorts of things that 
occur within you that seemed to be 

14
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:44,040
beyond your capacity to control your 
dreams.

15
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,900
For example,
that's a really good example.

16
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:47,310
Are Your impulses.
For example,

17
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:52,311
you might,
you might think of those as so foreign 

18
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:52,311
from you that they're not even.

19
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:52,311
You don't even want them to be part of 
you,

20
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:54,000
but,
but more subtly even.

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,940
How about what you're interested in,
what compels you?

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,620
Like,
where does that come from?

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
Exactly.
Because you can't.

24
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:06,441
God,
you can't conjure it up of your own 

25
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:06,441
accord,
you know,

26
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,560
so if you're a student in your taking 
difficult course,

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,150
you might say to yourself,
well,

28
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:11,370
I need to sit down and study for three 
hours,

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,530
but then you sit down and that is what 
happens.

30
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,960
Your attention goes everywhere and you 
might say,

31
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:18,090
well,
whose attention is it?

32
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:23,091
Then?
If it goes everywhere because you say 

33
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:23,091
it's your attention,
it's like,

34
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:23,100
well,
if it's your attention,

35
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:25,380
maybe you will be able to control it,
but you can't.

36
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,790
And so then you might think,
well jen and just exactly what the hell 

37
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:30,790
is controlling it.
And you might say,

38
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,380
well,
it's random.

39
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,060
It's better not be random.

40
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,300
I can tell you that that's,
that happens to some degree in 

41
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,031
schizophrenia.
There's an element of randomness in 

42
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:41,031
that.
It's not random,

43
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:45,590
it's driven by the action of,
of phenomena that I think are best 

44
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,820
considered as something like 
subpersonalities or they'll even.

45
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:52,821
That's only a partial description.
You can't make yourself interested in 

46
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:58,401
something.
Interest manifests itself in grips you.

47
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,490
That's a whole different thing.
And so what is it that's gripping you 

48
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,780
and how do you conceptualize that?
Is that a divine power?

49
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,930
Well,
it's defined as far as you're concerned 

50
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:11,930
because it grips you and you can't do 
anything about it,

51
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,840
and so there's a calling in you towards 
what you're compelled by and what you're

52
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:19,620
interested in that sometimes that might 
be very dark and sometimes not,

53
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,010
but you're compelled forward by your 
interest and so and so the idea that 

54
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,750
what moves you away from your country 
and your father's house and the comforts

55
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:35,751
of your childhood home is,
is something that's beyond you and that 

56
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:35,751
you listened to and Harken to.

57
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,890
That's exactly right.
And you can say,

58
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,360
well,
I don't want to call that God.

59
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:41,940
It's like it doesn't matter what you 
call it.

60
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,020
Exactly.
It doesn't matter to what it is,

61
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,900
what it's called.
It still is,

62
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,660
and if you don't listen to it,
that's the other thing.

63
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,960
If you don't listen to it,
and I've been a clinician and talked to 

64
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,360
enough people now as old as I am to know
this.

65
00:02:57,361 --> 00:03:00,250
Absolutely.
If you do not to that thing that beckons

66
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:05,251
you forward,
you will pay for it like you cannot 

67
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,770
possibly imagine.
You'll have everything that's terrible 

68
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,510
about life in your life and nothing 
about it that's good and worse.

69
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,570
You'll know that it was your fault and 
that you squandered what you could have 

70
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:15,570
had.
