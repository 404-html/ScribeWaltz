1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,250
Now I'm going to read a short story by 
Kurt Vonnegut,

2
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:10,251
Jr called Harrison Bergeron.
The era was 20,

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,470
81 and everyone was finally equal.
They weren't only equal before God and 

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,970
the law.
They were equal every which way.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,150
Nobody was smarter than anybody else.
Nobody was better looking than anybody 

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,321
else.
Nobody was stronger or quicker than 

7
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:28,080
anybody else.
All this equality was due to the 211,

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,180
212 and 213th amendments to the 
constitution and to the unceasing 

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,820
vigilance of agents of the United 
States,

10
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:40,821
handicapper general.
Some things about living still weren't 

11
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:42,240
quite right though.
April,

12
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:47,241
for instance,
still drove people crazy by not being 

13
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:48,790
springtime and it wasn't that clammy 
month that the h,

14
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:52,200
g men took George and Hazel Burger on 
his 14 year old son,

15
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:55,140
Harrison,
the way it was tragical right,

16
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,300
but George and Hazel couldn't think 
about it very hard.

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,850
Hazel had a perfectly average 
intelligence,

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,940
which meant she couldn't think about 
anything except in short bursts and 

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,421
George,
while his intelligence was way above 

20
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:10,371
normal,
had little mental handicap radio in his 

21
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:10,371
ear.

22
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:13,730
He was required by law to wear it.
At all times it was doing to a 

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,930
government transmitter.
Every 20 seconds or so,

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,080
the transmitter would send out some 
sharp noise to keep people like George 

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,690
from taking unfair advantage of their 
brains.

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,330
George and Hazel,
we're watching television.

27
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,140
There were tears on Hazel's cheeks,
but she'd forgotten for the moment.

28
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:31,950
What they were about on the television 
screen were ballerinas.

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,740
A buzzer sounded George's head,
his thoughts flattened panic like 

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,900
bandits from a burglar alarm.
That was a real pretty dance.

31
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,820
That dance.
They just did said Hazel.

32
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,710
Huh?
Set George.

33
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,080
That dance.
It was nice at Hazel.

34
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,450
Yup.
Said George.

35
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,090
He tried to think a little bit about the
ballerinas.

36
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,210
They weren't really very good.
No better than anyone else would have 

37
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:56,790
been anyway.
They were burdened with sash weights and

38
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:01,791
bags of bird shot and their faces were 
masked so that no one is seeing a free 

39
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:05,601
and graceful gesture or a pretty face 
would feel like something the cat 

40
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:05,601
dragged in.

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,240
George was toying with the vague notion 
that maybe dancers shouldn't be 

42
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,331
handicapped,
but he didn't get very far with it 

43
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:14,331
before.
Another noise in his ear radio scattered

44
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,110
his thoughts.
George winced,

45
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,290
so two out of the eight ballerinas Hazel
Song wince having no mental handicap 

46
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:27,261
herself.
She had to ask George what the latest 

47
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:29,361
sound had been.
Sounded like someone hitting a milk 

48
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:29,610
bottle with a ball.
Peen Hammer said,

49
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:34,611
George,
I think it would be real interesting 

50
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:35,130
hearing all the different sounds said,
Hazel,

51
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,660
a little envious.
All the things they think up or said,

52
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:42,570
George only if I was handicapper 
general,

53
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:44,790
you know what I would do,
said Hazel Hazel.

54
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:49,791
As a matter of fact,
boris strong re resemblance to the 

55
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,810
handicapper general.
A woman named Diana Moon glamours.

56
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,150
If I was Diana Moon,
clappers said,

57
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:56,010
Hazel,
I'd have chimes on Sunday.

58
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,770
Just chimes kind of in honor of 
religion.

59
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,230
I could think if it was just chimed,
said George.

60
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,300
Well,
maybe make them real loud.

61
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:09,301
Said Hazel,
I think I'd make a good handicapper 

62
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:11,110
general good as anybody else at George 
who knows better than I do.

63
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:13,340
What normal list said.
Hazel right?

64
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,750
Said George.
He began to think glimmering ugly about 

65
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,081
us.
Abnormal son who is now in jail about 

66
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:24,871
Harrison,
but at 21 gun salute in his head 

67
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,980
stopped.
That boy said Hazel Dow was a Doozy,

68
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:31,981
wasn't it?
It was such a doozy to George who was 

69
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:33,130
white and trembling and tears stood on 
the rims of his red eyes.

70
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,430
Two of the eight ballerinas had 
collapsed to the studio floor and we're 

71
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,300
holding their temples.
All of a sudden you look so tired,

72
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:43,150
said Hazel,
why don't you stretch out on the sofa so

73
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:46,600
as you can rescue your head,
rest your handicap bag on the pillows.

74
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,650
Honeybunch,
she was referring to the 47 pounds of 

75
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,811
birdshot in a canvas bag,
which was padlocked around George's 

76
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:54,811
nick.

77
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:56,170
Go out and risk the bag for a little 
while.

78
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:58,330
She said,
I don't care if you're not equal to me.

79
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:01,930
For Awhile,
George weighed the bag with his hands.

80
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,460
I don't mind it.
He said,

81
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,730
I don't notice it anymore.
It's,

82
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,090
it's just a part of me.
You've been so tired lately.

83
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,790
Kind of wore out,
said Hazel,

84
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,910
if there was just some way we could make
a little hole in the bottom of the bag 

85
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,971
and just take out a few of them.
Lead balls just a few two years in 

86
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:20,980
prison in $2,000.
Fine for every ball I take out.

87
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,470
Said George,
I don't call out a bargain.

88
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,310
I if you could just take a few out.
When you came home from work,

89
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:32,311
said Hazel.
I mean you don't compete with anyone 

90
00:04:32,311 --> 00:04:32,311
around here.
You just sit around.

91
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,570
If I tried to get away with it,
said George,

92
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:39,571
then other people get away with it and 
pretty soon we'd be right back to the 

93
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,080
dark ages again with everybody competing
against everybody else.

94
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,730
You wouldn't like that,
would you?

95
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,590
I'd hate it.
Said Hazel.

96
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,950
There you are.
The minute people start cheating on 

97
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:49,950
laws,
what do you think happens to society?

98
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,740
If Hazel hadn't been able to come up 
with an answer to this question?

99
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,920
George couldn't have supplied one.
A siren was going off in his head 

100
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,370
wrecking it all fall apart.
Said Hazel.

101
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:05,790
What would said George blankly?
Society said Hazel uncertainly was.

102
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,570
Wasn't that what you just said?
Who knows?

103
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,770
George,
the TV program was suddenly interrupted 

104
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,921
for a news bulletin.
It wasn't clear at first as to what the 

105
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:18,730
bulletin was about since the announcer,
like all announcers had a serious speech

106
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:22,150
impediment for about half a minute and 
in a state of high excitement,

107
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:24,670
you announced you're tried to say,
ladies and gentlemen,

108
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,420
he finally gave up and handed the bullet
into a ballerina to read.

109
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,370
That's all right.
Hazel said,

110
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,950
if the announcer he tried,
that's the big thing.

111
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,920
He tried to do the best he could with 
what God gave him.

112
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,200
He should get a nice rates for trying so
hard.

113
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,250
Ladies and gentlemen said the Ballerina 
reading the bulletin,

114
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,610
she must have been extraordinarily 
beautiful because the mask she wore was 

115
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,851
hideous and it was easy to see that she 
was the strongest and most graceful of 

116
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,541
all.
The dancers for her handicap bags were 

117
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,031
as big as those worn by 200 pound men 
and she had to apologize at once for her

118
00:05:57,171 --> 00:06:02,171
voice,
which was a very unfair voice for a 

119
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:02,171
woman to use.
It was a warm,

120
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:03,860
luminous,
timeless melody.

121
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,810
Excuse me.
She said,

122
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,230
and she began to get making her voice 
absolutely uncompetitive.

123
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,370
Harrison Bergeron age 14.
She said,

124
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,420
Nick Rockwell squawk has just escaped 
from jail where he was held on suspicion

125
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:22,421
of plotting to overthrow the government.
He is a genius and an athlete is under 

126
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:24,620
handicapped and shouldn't be regarded as
extremely dangerous.

127
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,540
A police photograph of Harrison Bergeron
was flashed on the screen upside down,

128
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,850
then sideways,
upside down again.

129
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,970
Then right side up the pictures showed 
the full length of Harrison against the 

130
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,750
background calibrated in feet and 
inches.

131
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,930
He was exactly seven feet tall.
The rest of Harrison's appearance was 

132
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,920
Halloween and hardware.
Nobody had ever been born.

133
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,310
Nobody had ever borne heavier handicaps.
He'd outgrown hindrances faster than the

134
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:53,420
h,
g men could think them up.

135
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,870
Instead of a little ear radio for a 
mental handicap,

136
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,370
he wore a tremendous pair of earphones 
and spectacles with thick wavy lenses.

137
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,150
These spectacles were intended to make 
them not only half blind,

138
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:10,151
but to give them waning headaches.
Besides scrap metal was hung all over 

139
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:10,670
him.
Ordinarily,

140
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:15,671
there was a certain symmetry,
a military uniqueness to the handicaps 

141
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:19,121
issued two strong people,
but Harrison looked like a walking junk 

142
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:19,121
yard.
In the race of life.

143
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,120
He carried 300 pounds at the offset.
His good looks,

144
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:28,121
the h,
g men required that he wear it all 

145
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:30,101
times.
A red rubber ball for a nose keep his 

146
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,561
eyebrows shaved off and cover his even 
white teeth with black caps at 

147
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:36,020
snaggletooth random.
If you see this boy said the Ballerina,

148
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,490
do not.
I repeat.

149
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,540
Do not try to reason with them.
There was the shriek of adore being torn

150
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,860
from its hinges,
screams and barking.

151
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,280
Cries of consternation came from the 
television,

152
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:49,700
set the photograph of Harrison Bergeron 
on the screen,

153
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:52,760
jumped again and again as though dancing
to the tune of an earthquake.

154
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,210
George Bergeron correctly identified the
earthquake and well he might've for many

155
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,240
was the time his own home had danced to 
the same crashing tune my God sent 

156
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,850
George.
That must be Harrison.

157
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,780
The realization was blasted from his 
mind instantly by the sound of an 

158
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:10,780
automobile collision in his head.

159
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:15,230
When George could open his eyes again.
The photograph of Harrison was gone.

160
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,840
The living breathing.
Harrison filled the screen.

161
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,850
Clanking clownish and huge Harrison 
stood in the center of the studio.

162
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,150
The knob of the uprooted studio door was
still in his hand.

163
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,830
Ballerinas,
technicians,

164
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:31,760
musicians and announcers cowered on 
their knees before him expecting to die.

165
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,490
I am the emperor cried.
Harrison,

166
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,590
do you.
Here I am the emperor.

167
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Everybody must do what I say at once.
He stamped his foot and the studio 

168
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
shook.
Even as I stand here,

169
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:44,420
he bellowed crippled,
hobbled,

170
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:49,421
and sickened.
I'm a greater ruler than any man who 

171
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:49,421
ever lived.
Now,

172
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:53,261
watch me become what I can become.
He toured the straps of his handicap 

173
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:57,630
harness like wet tissue paper,
tore straps guaranteed to support 5,000

174
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:02,631
pounds.
His scrap iron handicaps crashed to the 

175
00:09:02,631 --> 00:09:03,930
floor.
Harrison thrust his thumbs under the bar

176
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:06,000
of the padlock that securities head 
harness.

177
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,150
The bar snapped like celery.
Harrison smashed his headphones and 

178
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,350
spectacles against the wall.
He flung away as rubber ball,

179
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:16,110
nose revealing a man that could avoid 
thor,

180
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:18,990
the god of thunder.
I shall now select my empress.

181
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:23,991
He said,
looking down in the calorie people let 

182
00:09:23,991 --> 00:09:25,350
the first woman who dares rise to her 
feet claim her mate enter thrown.

183
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,290
I'm all at past,
and then a ballerina arose,

184
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,350
swaying like a willow.
Harrison plucked a mental handicap from 

185
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,071
her ear,
snapped off her physical handicaps with 

186
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:37,071
marvelous delicacy.
Last of all,

187
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:39,930
he removed her mask.
She was blindingly beautiful.

188
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,710
Now said Harrison,
shall we show the people the meaning of 

189
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,910
the word dance music he commanded the 
musicians,

190
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:49,990
scrambled back into their chairs and 
Harrison,

191
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:52,950
strip them of their handicaps too.
Play your best.

192
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:57,951
He told them,
and I'll make you barons and dukes and 

193
00:09:57,951 --> 00:09:57,951
earls.
The music began.

194
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,420
It was normal at first,
chilly,

195
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,750
cheap,
silly and false,

196
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,080
but Harrison snatched two musicians from
their chairs,

197
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:10,560
waved them like batons as he's saying 
the music as he wanted it played.

198
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,160
He slammed it back into their chairs.
The music began again and was much 

199
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,061
improved.
Harrison and his empress merely listen 

200
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:20,940
to the music for a while listened 
gravely.

201
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,040
As those synchronizing their heartbeats 
with it,

202
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:28,310
they shifted their weight to their toes.
Harrison placed his big hands on a 

203
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,760
girl's tiny waist,
letting your sense,

204
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,680
the weightlessness that would soon be 
hers,

205
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,850
and then an explosion of joy and grace 
into the air they sprang.

206
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,580
Not only were the laws of the land 
abandoned,

207
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,160
but the law of gravity and the laws of 
motion as well.

208
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,990
They reeled whirled,
swiveled,

209
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:44,160
flounced,
capers,

210
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,520
gambled and spun.
They leaped like deer on the moon.

211
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,170
The studio ceiling was 30 feet high,
but each leap brought the dancers nearer

212
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:52,500
to it.

213
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,710
It became their obvious intention to 
kiss the ceiling.

214
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,130
They kissed it,
and then neutralizing gravity with love 

215
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,911
and pure will,
they remain suspended in Arab inches 

216
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:05,130
below the ceiling,
and they kissed each other for a long,

217
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:09,030
long time.
It was then that Diana Moon clambers,

218
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,120
the handicapper general,
came into the studio with a double 

219
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,451
barreled 10 gauge shotgun.
She fired twice and the emperor and the 

220
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:19,290
empress were dead before they hit the 
floor.

221
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,800
Diana Moon clampers loaded the gun 
again.

222
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,160
She aimed it at the musicians and told 
them that they had 10 seconds to get 

223
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,611
their handicaps back on.
It was then that the birds are on 

224
00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:31,920
television too.
Burned out.

225
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,550
Hazel turned to comment about the 
blackout to George,

226
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,580
but George had gone out to the kitchen 
for a can of beer.

227
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,410
George came back in with the beer past 
while a handicap signal shook him up.

228
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,680
Then he sat down again.
You've been crying.

229
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,240
He said to Hazel.
Yup.

230
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,030
She said,
what about?

231
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,660
He said,
uh,

232
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,820
I forget.
She said something real sound on 

233
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:57,820
television.
What was it?

234
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,040
George said,
it's all kind of mixed up in my mindset.

235
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,170
Hazel,
forget sad things.

236
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,940
Said George.
Hi.

237
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,380
Always do.
Said Hazel.

238
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,270
That's my girl.
Said George,

239
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:10,120
he winced.
There was the sound of a riveting gun in

240
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:11,530
his head.
Gee,

241
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,810
I could tell that one was a doozy.
Said Hazel.

242
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,240
You can say that again.
Saint George.

243
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,220
She said,
Hazel,

244
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,540
I could tell that that one was a doozy.
