1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,370
We've got a hypothesis that we're still 
working out that supported to some 

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,961
degree by the relevant literature.
So imagine that you're looking for a 

3
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:08,961
stable partner.
Right.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So you might think well what do you want
in a stable partner and at least in 

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,771
principle one of the things you don't 
want is too much mismatch between you 

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,570
and that person on the five fundamental 
dimensions.

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,590
So for example if you're really 
extroverted and you have a really 

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,441
introverted partner you're going to 
engage in continual conflict about how 

9
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:35,511
much social activity the two of you 
should should be should should what 

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,180
subject yourself to and it's very very 
difficult for people who broadly differ 

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,831
widely differ on those dimensions to 
come to consensus because it's not just 

12
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:48,600
a matter of opinion.
Right it's really a matter of different.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,400
If you're looking at extremes of really 
different types of people then the thing

14
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:58,401
about introverts is they just don't 
enjoy large scale social interaction 

15
00:00:58,401 --> 00:00:59,920
much one on one they're often fine.

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,970
But in a group they don't like that.
And it tires them out whereas a real 

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,751
extrovert it's like you isolate them and
they just wither on the vine because a 

18
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:13,011
huge part of what actually motivates 
them in a positive way is tangled up 

19
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:16,710
with social interaction.
And so if you're an agreeable person and

20
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:21,711
you have a particularly disagreeable 
partner you're also going to run into 

21
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:25,101
problems because the agreeable person 
will say whatever you want whenever and 

22
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:29,421
the agreeable disagreeable person will 
say Well I'd like to know what the hell 

23
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:33,381
you want for a change and be much more 
harsh and much more demanding in the 

24
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:37,521
situation and the agreeable person is 
going to find the disagreeable person 

25
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:41,541
harsh and unpleasant and disagreeable 
person is going to find the agreeable 

26
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,370
person wishy washy and unable to stand 
up for themselves.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,400
And again that's that's actually one of 
the primary sources of tension between 

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,690
men and women because women tend to be 
higher in agreeableness than men.

29
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,520
It's about half a standard deviation 
which is quite quite quite quite a large

30
00:01:56,521 --> 00:02:01,521
difference by psychological standards.
And so what that means I probably 

31
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:07,470
haven't got this statistic quite right.
But I think I've got it about right.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,500
What that means fundamentally just so 
you have some sense of how large the 

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,490
effect that is is that if you have a 
group of men and women and you pick out 

34
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,021
random pairs the woman is going to be 
more agreeable than the man 60 percent 

35
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:23,310
of the time.
So that's not an overwhelming proportion

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,020
but it's a reliable and it's quite it's 
quite large.

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,040
By psychological standards.
So there's the problem with 

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,371
agreeableness with conscientiousness.
Well if you're conscientious you're 

39
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:38,931
industrious and orderly and orderly 
people seem to be sensitive to disgust 

40
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:41,700
which is something we'll talk about in 
detail later.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We've had a hard time specifying exactly
what makes industrious people 

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,591
industrious because it's hard to come up
with an animal model for that sort of 

43
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:51,591
thing and there's no theoretical model.

44
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:56,510
But our latest idea is that it's not my 
idea it's actually the idea of my 

45
00:02:56,761 --> 00:03:01,761
graduate student Christine Brophy is 
that industrious people find it 

46
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,840
unpleasant and unsettling to not be 
doing something.

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,320
So it isn't so much that industriousness
makes them happy or fills them with 

48
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,161
positive emotion.
That would be more extraversion right 

49
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:16,161
because extroversion is the positive 
emotion to mention.

50
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:20,190
It's that industrious people can't stand
sitting around doing nothing.

51
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,520
And you know this is speculation but you
know human beings are obviously always 

52
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:31,191
engaged in the exchange of labor 
especially the reciprocal exchange of 

53
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:35,001
labor and you can imagine that in a 
community where everyone knows everyone.

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,760
The people who work hard are going to be
pretty irritated on a fairly chronic 

55
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,610
basis with the people who are completely
unproductive.

56
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,970
And my suspicions are that plenty of 
people who are completely unproductive 

57
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,381
in the history of our of the evolution 
of our species were wiped out by people 

58
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,730
who were unhappy with their lack of 
productivity.

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,760
And so I think generally speaking human 
beings have this sense of ethical 

60
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,591
obligation with regards to one another 
to share labor and people who are 

61
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:08,361
conscientious really really feel that so
they feel bad if they're not busily 

62
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:11,320
working on something that's productive 
all the time.

63
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,600
And so the advantage to being with 
someone conscientious is well they're 

64
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,791
going to work like mad.
But the disadvantages there they're 

65
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,640
going to work like mad.
So you know if you're looking for a 

66
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,551
partner that you want to relax with or 
have fun with or who isn't uptight then 

67
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:27,210
a conscientious person is probably not a
very good choice.

68
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,600
On the other hand if you're a 
conscientious person and you're living 

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,961
with someone who's really an 
conscientious that's good because they 

70
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:38,901
might be able to help you relax but 
you're not going to be happy with them 

71
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:38,901
because they don't work nearly as hard 
as you do.

72
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:43,360
But even worse on the orderly dimension 
you know some of you have had roommates 

73
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,450
and maybe you're more orderly than your 
roommate.

74
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,510
What does it mean.
Means you're annoyed by mass before they

75
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:55,641
are and you don't have to be annoyed by 
mass much before you're less orderly 

76
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:58,650
roommate for you to be the one that's 
always running around picking things up.

77
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,210
And so actually one of the things that's
emerged from the psychometric analysis 

78
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,941
is that women are slightly more orderly 
than man and I suspect that has 

79
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:12,051
something to do with.
What would you call it inequitable 

80
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:15,231
distribution of housework.
Because even if your imagine that your 

81
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,690
proclivity is to be triggered by a 
disorder twenty five seconds before your

82
00:05:18,691 --> 00:05:23,691
partner's well you're going to end up it
doesn't take much difference for you to 

83
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,440
be the one that's always concerned about
the mess first.

84
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,980
So anyways and so if you're a really 
orderly person and you live with a 

85
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:30,980
disorderly person.

86
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,570
Well good luck getting along with them.
They're going to regard you as like 

87
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,810
uptight and and overconcerned with 
details.

88
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,420
And and well and unwilling to relax 
that's for sure and they're going to 

89
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:49,521
regard you as well just a bloody mess.
And how can anyone possibly live with 

90
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:50,770
someone like you.
And so.

91
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,050
So another reason why it's useful to 
understand your personality is because I

92
00:05:55,051 --> 00:06:00,051
think it gives you a better crack at 
finding someone that you can actually 

93
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:03,240
live with over the long run and we don't
know what the optimal.

94
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,770
I don't think you want to live with 
someone who is exactly like you.

95
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,790
Because then both of you have the same 
strengths and weaknesses and there's a 

96
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,790
bit of a problem there.
Right.

97
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,770
Because maybe an agreeable person can 
use a bit of disagreeable person around 

98
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,580
them to balance each other out and vice 
versa.

99
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,630
Right.
So we don't understand the optimal 

100
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,840
balance for for a long term thriving in 
a relationship.

101
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,880
But I think we do understand the fact 
that if you're too different in your 

102
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,960
traits that where you are different is 
going to constitute a chronic source of.

103
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,090
Conflict.
