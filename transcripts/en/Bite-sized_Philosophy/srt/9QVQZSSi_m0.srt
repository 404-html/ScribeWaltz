1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,560
Order surrounded by chaos,
right?

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:06,660
It's like a tree.
It's like the the,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,940
the evolutionary home of primates,
the tree with the snakes on the ground.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,750
That's,
that's our landscape or it's the fire 

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,930
for tribal people and the terrors of the
forest that are beyond the,

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,890
that are beyond the.
The light that the fire casts.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,320
It's explored territory versus 
unexplored territory and that's,

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,950
that's an archetype as well that you 
can't not be in a situation where that's

9
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:34,800
the case.
Even if you're among friends,

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,250
you know,
you think that's explored territory.

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,310
That's not exactly right because what 
happens if you're among friends is that 

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,080
they carefully reveal new parts of 
themselves all the time.

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,600
So it's like they're blasting little 
elements of unexplored territory.

14
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:54,990
You territory at you constantly and if 
they don't,

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,500
then what happens?
You get bored and you look for New 

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,221
People and we know there's empirical 
data on that with regards to intimate 

17
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:08,541
relationships because there was a nice 
study done awhile back showing that 

18
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,340
looking at the ratio of positive to 
negative emotional experiences that were

19
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:14,040
most predictive of long term 
relationship success.

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,780
And the answer was,
you know,

21
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:20,781
obviously it depends on how you would 
measure an event and how you would 

22
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,560
measure positive and negative emotion.
But that aside,

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,950
the finding was something like if you're
in a relationship and you only have five

24
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,410
positive interactions to one negative 
interaction,

25
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,840
then the relationship will end.
It's too negative.

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,500
But if you have more than 11 positive 
interactions to one negative 

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,150
interaction,
then it also ends and you think,

28
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:45,270
well that's pretty bloody peculiar.
Wha why in the world would that be?

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Don't you want like a hundred to one 
positive to negative interactions and 

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,870
answer to that is what makes you think 
that you wanted to relationship so that 

31
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,640
you can be happy or at least happy 
moment to moment.

32
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,600
What?
Why do you think that it's not?

33
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,660
It's certainly not the case is that you 
know that too because you.

34
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,780
I'm,
I mean I bet you there's not a person in

35
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:07,950
this room who hasn't rejected someone 
because they were too nice to them.

36
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,590
Something like that person's no 
challenge.

37
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:15,591
It's something like that.
You want someone who you know you can 

38
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:18,801
get along with them,
but now and then they bite you and you 

39
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:18,801
think,
oh,

40
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:18,801
that's,
that's interesting.

41
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:22,700
You know I didn't really expect that,
and then you go and puzzle over it for 

42
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,821
awhile and you torture yourself about it
and that's one of the things that keeps 

43
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:29,241
you really linked into the relationship 
and the reason for that is that part of 

44
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:33,081
the reason that you want the 
relationship isn't so that you're happy 

45
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:35,571
right now so that you can live a high 
quality life across multiple decades and

46
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:40,470
so you're looking for someone that you 
have to contend with who's going to push

47
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:45,471
you beyond what you already are and 
who's going to judge you harshly often 

48
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:49,881
for your limitations.
Now that'll make you angry and all of 

49
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:49,881
that,
you know,

50
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:51,000
and resentful and maybe you'll take your
revenge and and,

51
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:56,210
and all of that,
but you don't want someone who thinks 

52
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,961
you're perfect in your current foreign.
Partly because why would you want to go 

53
00:02:59,961 --> 00:02:59,961
out with someone that diluted.
