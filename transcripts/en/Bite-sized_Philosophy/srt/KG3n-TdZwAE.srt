1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,650
The idea is that if you're,
if you fall into a chaotic state and 

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,491
everything falls apart,
there's the possibility that

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,830
things can come back together,
including what you've just learned in a 

4
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:24,521
new state,
and so you can conceptualize that 

5
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:27,671
symbolically as the existence of the 
dead father at the bottom of the,

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,700
of the chaotic landscape.
That's.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,000
That's the proper way as far as I can 
tell to think about it.

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,230
It's like there's something down there 
that's capable of reforming and 

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,931
reemerging.
That's it incorporates the previous 

10
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:46,250
state,
but that takes it farther and you're not

11
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:51,251
going to find that unless you descend 
into this chaotic place where it feels 

12
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,600
like all order is gone while you 
generate order.

13
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:55,820
It's going to be akin to the order that 
you had before,

14
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:57,650
but there's going to be something new 
about it as well,

15
00:00:57,651 --> 00:01:02,651
so it's down to the bottom of the 
chaotic state to bring up what you're 

16
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:06,410
missing and that's one level of 
analysis.

17
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:08,060
Another level of analysis you think is,
well,

18
00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:09,140
that's also what you're doing.

19
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,230
That's what you should be doing.
In principle,

20
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:15,310
when you're going to university,
you're,

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,340
you come to university in roughly the 
same status.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,810
Pinocchio.
No,

23
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,170
you're a bit of a puppet and you're kind
of a jackass and what the hell do you 

24
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,351
know?
And it's chaotic because you haven't 

25
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:31,250
found your place in the world properly,
and I don't mean merely for career,

26
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,410
not that that's not relevant because it 
is,

27
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,710
but it's more important than that.
It's because you're a historical 

28
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,890
creature because you are a product of 
history.

29
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,250
Unless you are inculturated properly,
which means you understand your past and

30
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:50,870
in the sense that the humanities can 
allow for that,

31
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,590
then

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,920
you haven't been able to incorporate the
wisdom of your ancestors into your day 

33
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:02,290
to day pursuits and that's gonna make 
you weak.

34
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,730
That's the idea.
Anyways,

35
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,710
and so when you come to university,
this is what universities for it so that

36
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:13,711
you can go into the chaos and you can 
pull something out of it.

37
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:18,040
That's truly a value and you can 
incorporate that in your own personality

38
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,800
and that makes you much,
much stronger,

39
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,880
like literally stronger.
Not more educated but not.

40
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,970
It's not like you know more facts.
It's that you literally are a better 

41
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,080
person and better means you can do far 
more things.

42
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:37,081
You can articulate your that's.
That's something that's of crucial 

43
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:37,210
importance is that you can articulate 
yourself properly,

44
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,170
which is more useful than anything else 
you could possibly manage.

45
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:46,171
Like if you guys come out of university 
capable of making coherent arguments and

46
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:52,000
using language properly,
you're so powerful that it's ridiculous.

47
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,100
You,
you always,

48
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,380
you can lay out a strategy and pursue it
successfully and maybe the strategy is 

49
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,260
actually oriented towards something 
good.

50
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:07,261
Something that will actually work,
work for you and work for other people 

51
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:08,290
as well,
and I don't really understand why people

52
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,590
aren't taught,
told this when they come to university,

53
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:15,591
is that your goal is to make yourself as
articulate in writing and thinking and 

54
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:23,071
speaking as you possibly can because 
that opens the door to everything that 

55
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:25,720
you'll want to do in the future.
No matter what it is,

56
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,290
the more articulate person always rises 
always because they lay out strategies 

57
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:41,131
more effectively.
They lay out the reasons for doing 

58
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:42,340
something or for not doing something 
more particularly.

59
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:47,341
They convinced people and properly so 
that they can grapple with potentials 

60
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:54,570
that lies ahead effectively and they can
defend themselves when they're 

61
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:59,791
challenged and so all of that is going 
into the past,

62
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,180
into the chaos of the past.
You could even say and pulling up the 

63
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,800
spirit that inhabits that from the 
bottom and uniting with it,

64
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,870
and if you don't do that well,

65
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,740
you're defenseless in the case of in the
face of the tragedy of life and and then

66
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:25,871
then that's not so good because if 
you're defenseless in the face of the 

67
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:29,271
tragedy of life,
then you get way more hurt than you 

68
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:32,241
would otherwise get and sort of the 
people around you and then the 

69
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:35,271
probability that you're going to be 
resentful and bitter about that is 

70
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:38,301
really hard because no one likes to fail
continually and then you get bitter and 

71
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:42,330
resentful and then once you're bitter 
and resentful,

72
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:46,000
well being,
being vengeful in mean is the next step.

73
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,630
It doesn't take much of a transformation
to move you from that place to the next.
