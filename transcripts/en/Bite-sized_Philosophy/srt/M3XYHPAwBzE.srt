1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,270
Yeah,
so there's this interesting phenomenon 

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,400
that it's very characteristic of,
of,

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,650
of societies,
I believe pretty much everywhere it's 

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,291
being studied.
Now you can calculate an index called 

5
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:19,731
the Gini Coefficient.
The Gini Coefficient is a number that 

6
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:23,631
represents how much inequality of income
distribution there isn't a given 

7
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:28,161
geographical area.
So you could calculate a Gini 

8
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:28,980
Coefficient for a street or a,
you know,

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,370
an area in a city or a city or a state 
or a country.

10
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:35,040
You can do it at all those levels.
And uh,

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,090
what you find is,
you know,

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,960
you always hear this idea that poverty 
causes crime.

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,860
That's a classic leftwing idea,
but it's wrong,

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,040
it's seriously wrong and it's 
importantly wrong.

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,610
And it's definitively wrong.
Not only that,

16
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,970
so there's no argument about this.
It's already been established.

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,360
What causes crime,
especially aggressive crime is relative 

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,650
poverty and relative poverty is not the 
same thing as poverty at all.

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,920
It's seriously not the same thing.
Poverty is when you don't have enough to

20
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:09,921
eat.
Relative poverty is when the guy next 

21
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:10,170
door has a much better car than you.
So,

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,290
and there's lots of relative poverty in 
the United States.

23
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:18,291
And there's some absolute poverty,
but even the absolute poverty in the 

24
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:22,460
United States is nothing like the 
absolute poverty say in places like 

25
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,570
India or in Subsaharan Africa where 
absolute poverty means you have nothing.

26
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,260
Now what's really interesting about the 
Gini Coefficient is that if you go to 

27
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:34,680
places where everyone,
roughly speaking is poor,

28
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,950
say by national standards.
I think South Dakota was often used as 

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,440
an example or maybe one of the maritime 
provinces like Newfoundland,

30
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,980
where there's where there's low average 
income,

31
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:49,200
but it's pretty flat distribution.
There's almost no crime.

32
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,730
And if you go to the places where the 
everyone's rich,

33
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,930
then there's almost no crime.
But if you go places where there were 

34
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,750
poor people and moderately well off 
people and rich people and the 

35
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:08,301
distribution is really steep,
then the rate of aggressive behavior 

36
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:10,620
among young men and it's usually within 
their own ethnic group,

37
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:13,350
starts to spot skyrocket out of the 
control.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,800
And the reason for that seems to be that
if the dominance hierarchy is too steep 

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,511
than the young men have no likelihood of
climbing to a dominant position well 

40
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:28,731
playing the standard social game.
And so what they do is turn to 

41
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:28,950
aggression,
aggression to,

42
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,040
to make their mark on the world.
And it works too.

43
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,500
That's the other thing is that make no 
mistake about it.

44
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:39,501
If you're,
if you're looking for status in a place 

45
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:39,540
where status is hard to achieve and 
you're the meanest,

46
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,340
toughest guy around then and you know,
around a bunch of people who like,

47
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:49,341
you don't have much money,
then you're going to benefit from that 

48
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:49,341
status if it works.
Yeah.

49
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,820
Because they know that I,
that is higher than it is in Canada 

50
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,800
reason.
Sure,

51
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,390
sure.
Yeah.

52
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:06,391
I mean you can make a real conservative 
argument for making sure that the 

53
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:10,441
conservatives are very anti income 
distribution and we figured that's 

54
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,680
because of the guys that have this male 
independence,

55
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,920
you know,
they identify with this male 

56
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,451
independence factor.
They don't want to be distributing 

57
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:19,270
resources to people who are down in the 
dominance hierarchy because they will.

58
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,130
They want them down in the dominance 
hierarchy.

59
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:24,610
They want there to be a difference 
between the people on top and the people

60
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,130
on the bottom so that they can be the 
people on top.

61
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,440
So that it increases the relative 
attractiveness,

62
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:34,441
like it's a perfectly logical game and 
they presume that while the rules are 

63
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:39,031
set up and like every man can go for it,
do as fast in the winter winds and the 

64
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:40,450
loser loses and that's just how it is.

65
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,480
And don't ask me to fix it because I 
don't want to,

66
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,250
you know.
And besides that it's,

67
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,580
I don't find it,
I find it distasteful to attempt to fix 

68
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:50,580
it more than that.
Right?

69
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,440
Because it's a moral issue.
It's not an intellectual issue.

70
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,230
So.
So you,

71
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,290
you can make a case however you can make
a case from the conservative point of 

72
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,311
view,
especially with regards to say beliefs 

73
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,180
and religious traditionalism and the 
desire to maintain social stability that

74
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:10,720
you shouldn't let income distribution 
become two unequal.

75
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,840
Like one of the big things your society 
has to do is to make sure that that 

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,260
doesn't get out of hand because it tends
to get out of hand.

77
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:22,261
It tends towards a few people having 
everything and almost everyone else 

78
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:23,530
having nothing.
It's a natural in a sense.

79
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:27,100
It's a natural consequence of economic 
progression,

80
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,020
which is actually something that marks 
pointed out,

81
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:34,230
although an Italian name,
peritoneal had figured it out at 

82
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,460
approximately the same time and I think 
with a lot more conceptual clarity,

83
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,240
but the more unequal you let your 
society get,

84
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:44,290
the higher the probability of death 
roughly speaking through through violent

85
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,490
causes and you know,
um,

86
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:48,760
but,
but,

87
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,280
but I'm telling you why it is that,
you know,

88
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,060
men want to climb the dominance 
hierarchy and the reason they want to 

89
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,191
call them the dominance hierarchies 
because that's how they get access to 

90
00:04:59,191 --> 00:04:59,191
women

91
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,200
fucking familiar,
familiar in the structure.

92
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,870
So it seems like we all want to live 
within the structure yourself.

93
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,150
Well,
we have this contradictory problem.

94
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,830
We want to be protected by the 
structure,

95
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:19,810
but we want to advance our position 
within it.

96
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,830
And so that means what that should mean.
And this is,

97
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:28,831
I think the definition of civilized 
behavior is that you're allowed to 

98
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:33,361
advance your position within the 
structure as long as you don't disrupt 

99
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:33,880
it negatively.
You know,

100
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:36,910
and I think most people do do that.
In fact,

101
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:41,911
I think people in civilized countries do
that so effectively that it's an 

102
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:46,350
absolute incomprehensible miracle.
I can't understand how or why it ever 

103
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:49,750
got established,
but like a psychopath will.

104
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,170
He climbed the ladder and cut the rungs 
off underneath them fundamentally,

105
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,400
right?
It's like he doesn't care.

106
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:56,530
He doesn't even care if the damn thing 
maintains itself.

107
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,090
You know,
he's perfectly willing to have it 

108
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,090
destroyed after he's exhausted it,
you know,

109
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,970
but if everyone acted like that,
or even if a fairly substantial 

110
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,170
percentage of people acted like that,
the whole thing would come to a halt,

111
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,860
virtually like in no time flat.
So,

112
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,300
so mean.

113
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,040
Why?
See?

114
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,290
You might hear.
Here's the reason.

115
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,780
Likely,
you know,

116
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,240
because one of the things we were 
talking about was masculine violence.

117
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,350
Now the thing about masculine violence 
is it only tends to emerge in situations

118
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:35,351
where there doesn't.
There don't seem to be any other 

119
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:38,000
reasonably viable means of advancing 
status.

120
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,940
So it's not reasonable to say that men 
are aggressive.

121
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,210
You can say that on average,
men are more aggressive than women.

122
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,200
And you can also say that if that if you
put men in a situation where they have 

123
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,360
no,
where they can see status differences,

124
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,390
but they have no means of moving 
forward,

125
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,320
that they're likely to turn to 
aggression as a way of establishing 

126
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,520
dominance.
And then you can say that that's the 

127
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:06,520
reason for that is because it makes them
more attractive.

128
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,120
What are the fundamental reasons

129
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,090
I read this article was about how 
societies are.

130
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,110
Yeah,
absolutely.

131
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,450
When one guy has two wives,
I mean 50 percent of the population have

132
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,360
access to sex.

133
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,600
Yeah,
that's exactly right.

134
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:26,260
That the,
the,

135
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:31,261
the,
the evolutionary psychology explanation 

136
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:31,261
for the pathology of polygamy is that 
if,

137
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:33,760
once you let it establish itself,
then the men get ultra violent.

138
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,040
So.
So would you say that

139
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,910
many people have said that and.
Yes,

140
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:43,650
I think you can make a strong case for 
that.

141
00:07:43,651 --> 00:07:46,560
And I think the fundamental reason is 
the one that you just pointed out,

142
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,270
you know,
the idea is,

143
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,690
well,
would you rather have one woman or die 

144
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,420
now or sorry,
that's not quite right.

145
00:07:57,421 --> 00:07:58,890
Would you rather know next?
Not Quite.

146
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,570
That's not quite right.
Would you,

147
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,600
it's more like,
would you be willing to limit yourself 

148
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,731
to one partner or have a shot at many 
partners but a much higher probability 

149
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:10,160
of dying?
Right.

150
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,450
And you know,
some guys will take that,

151
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,340
they'll take the high risk approach,
you know,

152
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:21,020
so now if this doesn't delineate the 
difference in individual differences in 

153
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,650
determining who's going to be 
aggressive,

154
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:27,240
because what'll happen is that as the 
Gini Coefficient pressure rises,

155
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,020
the more aggressive men,
the men who were more aggressive by 

156
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,300
nature will get more aggressive first.

157
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,450
Right?
So you could imagine there it's a 

158
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:38,450
threshold phenomena in some sense.
So add,

159
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,790
I,
I should tell you as well as the 

160
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,331
relationship between the Gini 
Coefficient and male on male homicide 

161
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:48,320
isn't like point two or point three,
which is about the correlation that 

162
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,010
you'd get if you were predicting 
something like that.

163
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:53,010
Using personality.
It's like point eight or point nine.

164
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,280
It's like it eats up all of it.
It's explanation.

165
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,370
So it's a huge effect.
You know,

166
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,890
it's so,
it's so big in affected.

167
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,910
You could basically say,
oh well we figured that out.

168
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:06,000
Although psychologists never know when 
they figured anything out in,

169
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:09,850
they keep endlessly retesting it over 
and over and over because you know,

170
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,820
we don't know how to bring our science 
to a stock,

171
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,810
but if you don't accept the Gini 
Coefficient aggression down,

172
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:20,811
it's like you might as well throw the 
rest of the social sciences out the 

173
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,500
window because the effect is 
unbelievably powerful.

174
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,930
Let you go.

175
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,300
It depends.
You can do it at any level of analysis.

176
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,820
You can do it,
you can do it by county,

177
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,120
you can do it by city,
you can do it by state and you can do it

178
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:36,430
by country and it works on all of those 
levels.

179
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,310
Predicted aggression.
You

180
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,600
Bet.
Yeah.

181
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,190
Yeah,
and that's a great question.

182
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,460
I mean the methodologically 
sophisticated studies have done exactly 

183
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,941
that to ensure that while to ensure that
it's actually this phenomena rather than

184
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,430
other factors that might be operative in
that particular geographical area.

185
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,210
So countries with a higher GDP,
Gini Coefficient or more violent and 

186
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,530
cities within that country that have a 
higher than average Gini Coefficient for

187
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:04,450
that country are more violent.
On average.

188
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,520
What's a very,
very robust,

189
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,320
robust,
robust finding.

190
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,960
So.
Alright,

191
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:16,030
so we're good.
We're going to say for the sake of 

192
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,041
argument that you've got the male 
dominance hierarchy and it's represented

193
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,580
as masculine.
No.

194
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,700
One of the things young said,
he thought that women carried an image 

195
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,440
of Matt Nan in their unconscious and 
she,

196
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:33,400
he thought that the image that women 
carried of men in their unconscious with

197
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,210
a group of men,
not an individual matt,

198
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,460
he called that the animus.
Whereas he believed that the image that 

199
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,541
women image of women that men carried in
their collective unconscious was of a 

200
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,800
single woman and he called that the 
anima.
