1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,860
What's the alternative given that they 
have a point,

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,780
while as far as I can tell,
the alternative is a proper return to 

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,950
the past and that is precisely to 
journey into the chaos,

4
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:17,951
to look at the worst possible thing and 
to pull the dead father up from the 

5
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,450
chaotic depths.
That's how you stop being a puppet.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,530
Someone whose strings are being pulled 
by forces they do not understand behind 

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:26,530
the scenes,

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,740
you find out what's great about your 
culture,

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,280
this thing that's provided us with 
everything that we see in this room,

10
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:38,210
this amazing warmth that we're 
experiencing when it's 30 bloody below,

11
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:43,211
outside the fact that the electricity of
the heart and the computational 

12
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:46,691
resources are working and that we can 
all sit here peacefully and then no one 

13
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:46,970
is hungry fat.
We're too fat.

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,340
That's our big problem.
Oh No,

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,310
we have so much stuff.
We're getting fat.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,980
Yeah,
well that's a good problem to have.

17
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,540
We should have some gratitude for what's
being produced that's brought us to this

18
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,960
point and we need to wake up and 
understand what we're doing.

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:03,740
Well,
that's what.

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,160
That's what people like.
That's what the psychoanalysts were 

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,891
trying to do in the 20th century.
That's what all the great clinicians 

22
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:14,711
we're trying to do and I would say above
all else that was what Carl young was 

23
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:14,711
trying to do.

24
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:19,570
He believed firmly that the idea of the 
divine spark within the individual was 

25
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:24,581
a,
was a metaphysical reality by which he 

26
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:27,401
meant a reality that actually 
transcended and existed superordinate to

27
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:30,800
the physical reality of more real 
reality.

28
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,220
That's whatever consciousness is 
something we understand from a 

29
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,551
scientific perspective,
not at all that's been represented in 

30
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:44,450
our mythologies as far back as we can 
push them as an independent agent in the

31
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:47,120
world,
giving rise to form.

32
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,290
That's how we treat each other.
That's how we recognize ourselves.

33
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:57,010
That's how we judge each other.
You make your bed and then you lie in it

34
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,710
and everyone knows it and that's not to 
say that you're not subject to random 

35
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,430
and chaotic circumstances and the 
tragedy of life.

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,120
Just because you can do some things 
doesn't mean you can do everything,

37
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,750
but you can do some things and if you 
don't do them,

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,960
then things fall apart and the problem 
with things falling apart is that you 

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,281
will be happy about it to the degree 
that you're not trying to repair them 

40
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:23,870
because to the degree that you do not 
manifest what's within you,

41
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,440
then your life falls apart around you 
and everything that could make you 

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,030
bitter multiplies until you're in a 
situation where you want the destruction

43
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:35,180
you want to bring it on,
and it's not surprising.

44
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,970
[inaudible] life can be so terrible that
the question of whether or not it should

45
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:44,971
exist at all can be a real question,
but the answer to that is his life so 

46
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,640
terrible that it shouldn't exist.
Well,

47
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:53,641
the answer is it depends on how you live
it and if your life is so terrible that 

48
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:59,371
you can't bear it,
then it raises the question of whether 

49
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:02,101
or not you're living at properly.
And that's not to say that people don't 

50
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:04,870
suffer under burdens that are too great 
for them to bear.

51
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:09,871
They certainly do.
It doesn't matter because if you let 

52
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:13,921
that embitter you,
if you let that destroy your allegiance 

53
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:17,611
to the proper path,
all it does is make that worse and 

54
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:18,310
everything else.
It's no out.
