1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,020
So women are much happier if you look at
national polls than they were saying in 

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,711
the late 19 fifties in early 19 sixties,
and I think that's partly because 

3
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:12,600
freedom and happiness,
those are not the same thing.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,720
They're not even close.
And now I see young women all the time 

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,051
struggling to figure out what to do with
their lives because they have no idea 

6
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:21,570
how to have a job slash career and a 
family.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,850
So.
And there's no answer to that.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,630
It's a really difficult problem,
you know,

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,640
and there's all sorts of ideas.
Like I did a lot of consulting for law 

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,821
firms for a long time about a decade and
I had a lot of clients who were 

11
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:36,120
extremely high functioning female 
lawyers,

12
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:41,121
younger ones trying to figure out how to
balance their career with their desire 

13
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:42,330
to have a life.
And you know,

14
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:47,331
you hear all the time about women being 
denied access to positions of power and 

15
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:49,590
that's uh,
that's the consequences of prejudice and

16
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,100
oppression.

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,820
It's like,
yeah,

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,860
yeah.
Everything is caused by the same thing 

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:56,860
first,
right?

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,060
You have got one causal principle.
Wonderful.

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,670
Now you're a philosopher.
You can figure out everything with it,

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,390
so like the law firms cannot keep their 
women in their thirties.

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,000
They cannot keep them.
The big law firms,

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,160
they all leave.
Why?

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,770
Because the women hit 30.
They're brilliant.

26
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,390
Conscientious,
intelligent.

27
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:14,100
They were deadly in highschool,
deadly,

28
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:16,230
and university.
They nailed law school.

29
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,610
They whipped through there.
Articling,

30
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,620
they,
they made partner by the time they were 

31
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:22,620
30 and it's like they're in a rocket to 
the top position.

32
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,470
What do they find when they get their 80
hour work weeks?

33
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,130
Right?
Because that's one of the things you 

34
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:31,130
want to think about.
You know,

35
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,801
you think that the people who run things
are sitting at home smoking big cigars 

36
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:34,470
and like telling their minions what to 
do.

37
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,670
That is not.
That's like the 19 twenties millionaire.

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,860
That's on the cover of the monopoly 
game.

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,390
Going sociological analysis.
I know lots of people like that and they

40
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:50,391
work all the time.
All the time from the second they wake 

41
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:53,690
up until the second they go to sleep and
they don't just casually work,

42
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,750
you know,
because I know some of you go to the 

43
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,131
library for six hours and you say,
well I studied in the library for six 

44
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:00,131
hours.
Like,

45
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:01,490
no you didn't.
You study for half an hour,

46
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,520
have coffee,
and you look through facebook and went 

47
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,840
home and you said,
well I studied for six hours and you're 

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:10,840
happy about it,
but you know,

49
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,480
bloody well you did partly because you 
can't,

50
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,880
you know,
I can only read through about three and 

51
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:16,880
a half hours until I'm done.
And I'm pretty good at it.

52
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,240
So these people who are running things,
there's corrupt people obviously,

53
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:23,180
but the vast majority of them first are 
self made.

54
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,030
Its second.
They're so bloody efficient and smart.

55
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,060
You cannot believe it.
And they work 80 hours a week and most 

56
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,570
of them happened to be mad.
And why is that?

57
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,690
Because there are a small number of 
insane men who will do nothing but work 

58
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,910
80 hours a week.
And no matter where you put them,

59
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:45,911
if you put them in the middle of a 
forest with an ax and all they would do 

60
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:48,821
is run around chopping down trees.
So the issue isn't why aren't there more

61
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:54,080
women in positions of power?
It's why are there any men insane enough

62
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,560
ever to occupy those positions?
You know,

63
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,660
because we also know and the on this,
it's very clear what's the relationship 

64
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:07,261
between money and wellbeing once you 
have enough money to keep the bill 

65
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:11,311
collectors from your door.
So once you have enough money to stave 

66
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:13,330
off misery,
which is sort of lower middle class,

67
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:16,390
something like that in our society,
maybe a little little lower than that,

68
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,850
extra money does not help you.

69
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,450
It does not improve your life.
So why bother with it?

70
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,570
Well,
that's what the women in the law firms 

71
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:27,570
think.
It's like most of them,

72
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,240
by the time they're in their thirties,
aren't married,

73
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,310
almost all of them are married to men 
who make as much money or more than they

74
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,340
do because that's what women go for,
cross culturally four to five years 

75
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,121
older,
equal or higher in the socioeconomic 

76
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:42,121
status.
So their,

77
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,430
their husband's already made $350,000
a year.

78
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,220
It's like they think,
well I don't need much more money.

79
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,640
The man used money to keep track of the 
competition by the way,

80
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,710
because all the male lawyers that I 
talked to,

81
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:56,410
her usually real hard ass guys really 
low in agreeableness,

82
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:59,380
really high in conscientiousness,
like conservative types,

83
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:04,381
low in openness as well and they want to
win and the reason they care about your 

84
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:07,000
damn bonus at the end of the year isn't 
even so much because of the money.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's because they got a much bigger 
bonus than the other son of a bitch 

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
sitting beside them and they're happy 
about that.

87
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,430
So there's a real,
like a real brass knuckles competition 

88
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,690
that drives these sorts of things.
But we get things backwards so often in,

89
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,780
in,
in psychology and in sociology.

90
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:26,530
It's not why there aren't more women in 
positions of power to whiting.

91
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Any men want those positions,
you just have no idea the amount of 

92
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,620
responsibility that comes along with 
that.

93
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,920
You just imagine for a minute trying to 
run a billion dollar corporation.

94
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,980
You can't even bloody well balanced your
checkbook and there's dust bunnies 

95
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,151
underneath your bed.
How in the world would you ever run a 

96
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:48,360
billion dollar corporation?
Those things are complicated and you 

97
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,690
have enemies and they're trying to take 
you out all the time.

98
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,670
You look at apple and Samsung,
man,

99
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,980
they're just torturing each other in the
courts nonstop.

100
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,010
You know,
you'll,

101
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,160
if you're,
if you're running a big corporation,

102
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:02,161
you'll be.
You'll be handling two or 300 lawsuits 

103
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:05,071
at a time and that's just,
that's just nothing compared to the 

104
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:05,830
complexity of what you actually have to 
do.

105
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,890
Stay on top of the technology,
constantly interact with your large 

106
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,211
customers.
Travel all the time because you have to 

107
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:17,740
maintain the relationships.
You have to regulate the politics inside

108
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:19,780
the business.
You have,

109
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,200
believe me,
it's no picnic and you think,

110
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:24,100
well,
they get a lot of money.

111
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:29,101
It's like,
what makes you think that such a good 

112
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:29,101
thing?
You know,

113
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:30,160
like if you're a half crazy and you have
a lot of money,

114
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:35,161
you're going to be crazy a lot faster.
I can tell you that frees you from all 

115
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:36,990
sorts of constraints.
You know,

116
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,030
we know the data on lottery winners,
they're no happier a year later at some 

117
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,270
of them are done,
especially if they had had like a bit of

118
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:46,300
a cocaine problem to begin with because 
you know,

119
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,540
being stops you from dying.

120
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,550
If you're a cocaine addict,
if you get enough money and the way you 

121
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:53,550
go and you think yourself,
you know,

122
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,450
you've got all sorts of bad habits.
Weirdnesses.

123
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,950
If somebody dumped an infinite of money 
or you,

124
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:00,560
what makes you think you would unravel 
completely?

125
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,110
It's highly probable.
So anyways,

126
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:09,111
so back to these women know what they do
when they're 30 is they look around and 

127
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:11,540
they played hit partner so they'd hit 
the pinnacle of their profession.

128
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,450
They think,
what the hell am I doing this for?

129
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Why would anyone in their right mind 
want to be woken up at three in the 

130
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,661
morning and Sunday by?
They're irate Japanese client who wants 

131
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:25,490
them to work for the next five hours 
nonstop to fix this damn problem,

132
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,030
which is going to cost them $100,000,000
right now.

133
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,040
Or we'll find someone else to pay $750 
an hour or two to fix it right now.

134
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,450
And you think,
well that's,

135
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,940
you know,
a masculine form of value that.

136
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:42,941
Because that's one of the criticisms.
If the law firms just adopted a more 

137
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:43,490
feminine structure of value,
it's like,

138
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:45,830
what kind of bullshit is that?
The reason,

139
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,890
the reason that you get up,
it's three in the morning on Sunday two 

140
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,960
to talk to your Japanese client who's 
freaking out about their contract is 

141
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,920
because if you don't jump the hell up 
and do it right now,

142
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,600
there's some starving associate who's 
unbelievably ambitious in New York.

143
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:04,601
Or pick up the pieces and two tenths of 
a second and they're smart and 

144
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:08,231
aggressive and they'll take you out.
So it has nothing to do with masculine 

145
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,900
structures of values.
All the foolish ideas.

146
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,260
And you know,
it's not just law where this happened 

147
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:17,260
to,
you know,

148
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:17,780
we know for example,
that female doctors were far fewer hours

149
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:17,990
too.

150
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,590
So the more female doctors you have,
the more doctors you have to have.

151
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,830
And I'm not complaining about women's 
priorities.

152
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,180
I'm not saying that women are wrong,
not at all.

153
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,390
It's like the older I get,
the more I understand that marriage and 

154
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,421
family are a primary importance and the 
more I see women in particular know they

155
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:42,641
hit 35 or 40 and they're not married,
they don't have kids and they are not 

156
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:46,511
happy because what the hell are you 
going to do from the time you're 40 

157
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:47,690
until the time you're 80,
you got no family,

158
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,300
you got no relationships.
What are you going to do?

159
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,970
Go Run your company.
Yeah.

160
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:57,971
Well if you're one in a thousand that 
will satisfy so you bloody well better.

161
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:03,551
Make sure you're that one in 10,000
and you're probably not because those 

162
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:03,551
people are rare.
