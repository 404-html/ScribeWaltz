1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,860
Ask and it shall be given you seek and 
you shall find knock and it shall be 

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,990
opened unto you for everyone that asks,
receives and he that seeketh findeth and

3
00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:13,550
to him that knocks it shall be opened.
That sounded pretty optimistic again,

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,950
but,
but again,

5
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:19,620
I think it's a description of the 
structure of existential reality and and

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,830
by,
by which I mean

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,110
when I'm in my clinical practice and I 
observe and this is also the case with 

8
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,291
my students,
is let's say people's lives aren't what 

9
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,340
they would like them to be.
And so then you ask why?

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,850
Well,
forget about tragedy and catastrophe 

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,850
because that's self evident and we're 
not going to discuss that.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,210
Although the degree to which you bring 
about your own tragedy is always 

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,160
indeterminant.
But I would never say that every 

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,970
terrible thing that is visited on a 
person is something they deserved.

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,000
I think that that's a very dangerous 
presupposition,

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,240
especially because everyone gets sick 
and everyone dies,

17
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,260
but one of the main reasons that people 
don't get what they want is because they

18
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:13,261
don't actually figure out what it is and
the probability that you're going to 

19
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:14,820
get.
What would be good for you,

20
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:16,560
let's say,
which would even be better than what you

21
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:17,310
want,
right?

22
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:22,311
Because you know,
you might be wrong about what you want 

23
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:22,380
easily,
but maybe you could get.

24
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:26,070
What would really be good for you?
Well,

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,060
why don't you.
Well,

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,660
because you don't try.
You don't think,

27
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:31,140
okay,

28
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,590
here's what I would like if I could have
it and I don't mean I don't mean in a 

29
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,571
way that you manipulate the world to 
force it to deliver you good for status 

30
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:44,350
or something like that.
That isn't what I mean.

31
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,680
I mean something like imagine that you 
were taking care of yourself like you 

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,310
were someone you actually cared for and 
then you thought,

33
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,170
okay,
I am caring for this person.

34
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:55,930
I would like things to go as well for 
them as possible.

35
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,170
What would their life have to be like in
order for that to be the case where 

36
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,830
people don't do that?
They don't sit down and think,

37
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,400
all right,
do you know?

38
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:04,510
Let's,
let's figure it out.

39
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:05,410
You're,
you've got a life.

40
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:06,940
It's hard.
Obviously.

41
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,450
It's like three years from now you can 
have what you need.

42
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,340
You got to be careful about it.
You can't have everything you can have,

43
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:20,341
what would be good for you,
but you have to figure out what it is 

44
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:20,341
and then you have to aim at it.

45
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,470
Well,
my experience with people is been as if 

46
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,620
they figure out what it is that would be
good for them and then they aim at it.

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,240
Then they get it and it's strange 
because they don't ness.

48
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,340
It's a strange thing.
It's not quite that simple because you 

49
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,601
know,
you may formulate an idea about what 

50
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:41,411
would be good for you and then you take 
10 steps towards that and you find out 

51
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,980
that your formulation was a bit off and 
so you have to reformulate your goal.

52
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,030
So you're kind of going like this as you
move towards the goal.

53
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,360
But a huge part of the reason that 
people fail is because they don't ever 

54
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,500
set up the criteria for success.
And so since success is a very narrow 

55
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,121
line and very unlikely,
the probability that you're going to 

56
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,611
stumble it randomly is zero.
And so if there's a proposition here in 

57
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:07,630
the proposition is if you actually want 
something,

58
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,610
you can have it now,
the question then would be,

59
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,130
well,
what do you mean by actually want?

60
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,980
And the answer is that you reorient your
life in every possible way to make the 

61
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:26,230
probability that that will occur as 
certain as possible.

62
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,060
And that's a sacrificial idea,
right?

63
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:32,920
It's like you don't get everything,
obviously you obviously,

64
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,640
but maybe you can have what you need and
maybe all you have to do to get it is 

65
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,980
ask,
but asking isn't a whim or,

66
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:47,981
or today's wish.
It's like you have to be deadly serious 

67
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:48,250
about it.
You have to think,

68
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:53,251
okay,
I'm taking stock of myself and if I was 

69
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:56,941
going to live properly in the world and 
I was going to set myself up such that 

70
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,310
being would justify itself in my 
estimation.

71
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,750
And I don't mean as a harsh judge 
exactly what is it that I would aim at?

72
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,740
Well,
one of the things I've found is that in 

73
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,350
test of this theory,
let's say you could try this.

74
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,610
This is a form of prayer knocking.
Sit on your bed one day and ask 

75
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:25,261
yourself,
what's what remarkably stupid things am 

76
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:29,170
I doing on a regular basis to absolutely
screw up my life,

77
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,490
and if you actually asked that question,
but you have to want to know the answer,

78
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:38,491
right,
because that's actually what asking the 

79
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:38,491
question means.
It doesn't mean just mouthing the words.

80
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:40,510
It means you have to decide that you 
want to know.

81
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,690
You'll figure that out so fast.
It'll make your hair curl,

82
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,670
you'll you.
It's as if young thought about this,

83
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:53,671
he saw it.
He thought that people had two poles of 

84
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:56,011
consciousness in one was the individual 
consciousness that we each identify 

85
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:59,761
within.
The other was something he called the 

86
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:01,261
self and the self is the.
You might think about it as the divine 

87
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:02,080
within.
That's close enough approximation.

88
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,960
It's the universal part of your 
consciousness.

89
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,900
It's your conscience.
That's another way of thinking about it.

90
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,770
Whatever your conscience is,
but it's something that you can consult.

91
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:16,771
It's like the socratic daymond socrates 
said that the thing that made him 

92
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:20,110
different than everyone else in Greece 
was that he consulted his demon,

93
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:25,111
his genius.
He asked himself how it was that he 

94
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:26,710
should conduct himself in the world,
and then he did that,

95
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,830
whatever it was,
he didn't try to force a solution.

96
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,990
You know,
he didn't try to force a solution.

97
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,550
Selfishly,
he asked,

98
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,270
I'm going to manifest myself in the best
possible manner in the world.

99
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:40,240
I would like to do that.
What would that be?

100
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,030
While you're perfectly capable of 
thinking,

101
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,440
God only knows how you're perfectly 
capable of immense feats of imagination 

102
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,020
and dreams and fantasies,
God only knows how you do all of that.

103
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,470
What would happen if you consulted 
yourself about the best possible outcome

104
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:58,930
for you?
You might get an answer.

105
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,970
Well,
that's what this proposition is.
