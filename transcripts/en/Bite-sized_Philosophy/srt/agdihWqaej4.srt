1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,100
So this is more differentiation of the 
archetype fundamentally.

2
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:10,101
So you see the dragon of chaos here,
that potential manifesting itself into 

3
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:12,810
this ambivalent feminine figure,
both both promise and threat.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,510
And then I've.
I've mapped this one out.

5
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:20,511
So the ambivalent feminine figure,
so sort of multi valence gives rise to 

6
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:24,351
the positive mother and then the 
positive mother gives birth to the hero 

7
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:25,950
and that's Hercules there and this.
I like this image a lot.

8
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:30,210
So Hercules is in this container so that
you can interpret that.

9
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:35,211
Both has something feminine,
that container but also as a 

10
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:37,611
representative of culture because it's a
boat that is floating on the chaotic 

11
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:37,611
ocean here.
So that target,

12
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:42,330
he asked to be in a container that 
sustains him in the murky water of chaos

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,010
and you see he's going out into the 
unknown and he's got a lion's skin on.

14
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,290
And that's partly because one of the 
initiation rituals for,

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,380
for young men when the reliance say in 
the Middle East and that wasn't very 

16
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,681
long ago,
was that you had to go and kill a lion 

17
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:00,681
with a spear and with a bow and Arrow or
something like that.

18
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:04,800
It's like that's impressive.
All things considered.

19
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:06,480
I mean you really think about that for a
minute.

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,210
You really want to go out and try to 
kill a lion with a stick.

21
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,650
It's like it probably.
You probably wouldn't be quite the same 

22
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:14,650
after you did that.
That would be my guess.

23
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,110
And so anyways,
so there's.

24
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:21,111
Hercules has got his lion skin on and 
that shows that he's assimilated to the 

25
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:24,651
lion,
the dominant sort of animal and that 

26
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,110
he's also mastered it and he's got his 
bow and Arrow to so he's.

27
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,270
He's going to hit the target properly.
He's not.

28
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,330
He's someone who doesn't seem because he
can hit the center of the target and 

29
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,640
he's got this club which I really liked 
because it's covered with eyes just like

30
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,450
Martech,
Mesopotamian hero.

31
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:41,451
Well,
what do you want to do when you go out 

32
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:41,451
into the unknown,
it's like arm yourself and pay attention

33
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:43,350
and so that's what you're trying to 
produce.

34
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,100
If you're a good mother is this figure 
that can go out into the unknown,

35
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,020
armed,
accurate,

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,440
and able to pay attention and that's a 
hell of a thing to participate in and 

37
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,681
it's really fun.
I found having children incredibly 

38
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:02,150
entertaining.
It's ridiculously entertaining thing to 

39
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,671
do because for a bunch of reasons.
One is that it's the only relationship 

40
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:09,381
you'll ever have in your life where you,
where you actually have a chance of 

41
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:12,411
establishing something that's close to 
perfect is with your kids because when 

42
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:12,600
they're delivered to you,
so to speak,

43
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,980
they're there in some sense they're 
perfect and your job is to maintain that

44
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:19,290
perfection.
If you can,

45
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,170
and you do that by being a good parent,
by being encouraging,

46
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:24,150
by being on their side,
by taking care of them,

47
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,650
and you can have an absolutely pristine 
relationship with the child.

48
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,990
That doesn't mean it's not full of 
trouble because it is,

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,310
but it's it.

50
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,400
It can easily be the best relationship 
you'll ever have in your life.

51
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,960
In fact,
I think that's.

52
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,170
It can be the worst to and you know 
sometimes you get unlucky in your child 

53
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,741
is sick mentally or physically and 
things fall apart and it's not your 

54
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:46,920
fault,
but sometimes it is your fault,

55
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,950
but it's a real gift and you have to 
play this game of protection and 

56
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:53,640
encouragement,
right?

57
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,940
Protection and encouragement and get 
that dynamic right,

58
00:02:56,941 --> 00:03:01,941
and then you build,
you help someone develop into something 

59
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:05,151
that's well exactly this,
that can take on the troubles of the 

60
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,660
world forthrightly and man,
that's what you want.

61
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,870
That'll make it worthwhile,
that's for sure.
