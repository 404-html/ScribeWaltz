1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,960
Being a highly creative woman,
I find myself fearful that having kids 

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,900
will be spiritual suicide,
hindering my endeavors,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,270
but I also don't want to have an 
unfulfilled life.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,480
Can I have a full life without kids?
Well,

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:13,090
yes,
I.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,240
I suspect you can.
Although it's risky because it's really 

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,651
important for people to have kids 
because the thing is is that you get 

8
00:00:21,651 --> 00:00:24,420
older than 40 and our culture is kind of
dopey in that regards.

9
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:28,200
It's underdeveloped.
We live as if we live as if we.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,630
We only exist when we're young and we 
don't.

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,870
It's like,
what are you going to do from the ages 

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:35,930
of say,
45 to 90 or 95?

13
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:37,680
You,
you need a family around you.

14
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:40,290
You need to see your children grow,
you need to have grandchildren.

15
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:45,291
It's a major part,
maybe the most important part of the 

16
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:45,630
last half of life.
No.

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,900
You said being a highly creative woman,
I find myself fearful that having kids 

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,030
will be spiritual suicide.

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,030
Well,
that's the part of your question that I 

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,030
would really address because I would 
say,

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,970
well,
don't let them be spiritual suicide.

22
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,570
You know?
It may be that there's a certain amount 

23
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,380
of time that you need to take away from 
the kids that,

24
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,190
and this is the case for parents in 
general,

25
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,650
um,
so that you can pursue your own creative

26
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,440
endeavors.
It's children do not have to devour your

27
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:11,730
life.
In fact,

28
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:16,731
if you let them devour your life,
then you'll hate them and you mistreat 

29
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:20,511
them.
And so what you want to do is to set 

30
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:23,241
yourself up so that you can have 
children and have a life and that's 

31
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:23,430
better for the children and it's better 
for you.

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,870
Like children can be taught,
encouraged to spend a fair bit of time,

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,460
not when they're infants,
obviously,

34
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:32,790
but to spend a fair bit of time amusing 
themselves.

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,120
And that's especially the case if you 
have more than one child because they'll

36
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,180
mutually amuse one another.
It's actually easier in some ways to 

37
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,751
have more than one child because with 
one child you're constantly abusing the 

38
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:45,030
child,
but with two or three,

39
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:50,031
then they're off in their little club.
Especially if you can stop them from 

40
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:54,440
developing sibling rivalry,
that's too intense and they can monitor 

41
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,990
themselves.
So the trick is,

42
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:59,991
if you're a highly creative woman is be 
disagreeable it now so that you can 

43
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:03,141
carve yourself out your own space so 
that you don't come to resent your 

44
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:03,150
children.
You're afraid of that.

45
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:06,480
You're afraid that it looks like you're 
afraid that if you,

46
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,870
if you give yourself two children,
there'll be nothing left for you.

47
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:11,250
And um,
you know,

48
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:13,830
that can happen if you have children who
have terrible health problems,

49
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:18,831
for example,
but you can't protect yourself against 

50
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:20,520
those eventualities in life anyways.
But I would say your best bet is to be a

51
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,530
more selfish mother.
And believe me,

52
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:26,580
I've had more clients who were ruined by
mothers who were too unselfish than.

53
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:29,190
I've had clients who were ruined by 
mothers who were too selfish.

54
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,070
So,
um,

55
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,970
you need to be there when the kids need 
you,

56
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:35,970
but you shouldn't be there any more than
is necessarily.

57
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,900
So

58
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:38,980
let's see.

59
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,260
Adam Watts's,
I feared having kids for the same 

60
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:53,260
reason.
I'm a full time pro artist.

61
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:53,990
You make your own normal.
Said,

62
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:56,510
my therapist.
Jp is speaking the truth.

63
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,590
Yeah,
well that's,

64
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,840
that's the thing.
You know,

65
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,870
don't be thinking that you can't 
organize your life when you have 

66
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,521
children.
The thing about modern people is that 

67
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:13,621
they're terrified of children.
They in this because they think they 

68
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:16,930
regard children as if they're miniature 
tyrants and they can be of course,

69
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:21,931
because anyone will tyrannized over you 
if you allow them to perhaps not anyone 

70
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:27,901
but virtually anyone.
Why not regulate your children's 

71
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:28,760
behavior?
I wrote a chapter in my new book called,

72
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,290
don't let your children do anything that
makes you dislike them and that's like 

73
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,770
really serious advice is like if you 
allow your children to conduct 

74
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,000
themselves around you in a manner that 
makes you dislike them.

75
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:43,210
If you're being honest,
if you're paying attention to the shadow

76
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:45,580
side of yourself that can be aggressive 
and destructive,

77
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,770
then then you're.

78
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,520
If you allow your children to do things 
that make you dislike them,

79
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:55,150
then they're going to.
They're having children is going to mess

80
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,980
up your life,
but you don't have to do that.

81
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,490
You're actually.
You actually have a tremendous amount of

82
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:04,600
control over the quality of your 
relationship with your children and also

83
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:08,170
the manner in which you choose to 
disperse your time and I mean you're,

84
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,650
you've got,
if you're willing to think it through 

85
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:17,920
and be clear,
you can be in charge of your household.

86
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,340
The children don't have to be in charge 
and it's not good for them to be in 

87
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,671
charge anyways.
So people are afraid of children and 

88
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:27,730
it's too bad because children are 
absolutely wonderful.

89
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:32,731
I mean,
you have to be careful with them and 

90
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:32,731
they get tired and they get hungry and 
they get hot and,

91
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,810
and they don't have an attention span.

92
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,170
That's as long as an adult who has a 
long attention span,

93
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,300
but they're great company and they're 
unbelievably comical and they love you.

94
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:48,301
And like they,
they give back far more than they take 

95
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:48,880
if you have an ounce of sense when 
you're dealing with them.

96
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,220
So yeah.
So,

97
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,010
so don't be afraid of children,
man.

98
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,770
You're,
you're the adult for God's sake.

99
00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:00,370
You've got the upper hand and and if you
have a partner you can rely on,

100
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:05,371
well then you know you can both decide 
how it is that you're going to run your 

101
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,430
household so that you're actually 
thrilled to death,

102
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,260
that you have kids and that you have a 
life.
