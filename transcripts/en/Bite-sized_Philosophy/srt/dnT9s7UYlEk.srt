1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,400
And behold,
the word of the Lord came unto him 

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,580
saying,
this shall not be there in heir,

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,060
but he that shall come forth out of the 
bottle,

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,070
should be nine here.
So he gets promised the impossible once 

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,791
again,
and he brought him forth abroad and 

6
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:17,791
said,
now look towards the heaven and tell the

7
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,090
stars if that will be able to number 
them.

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,180
And he said unto him,
so shall thy seed be,

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,450
and he believed in the Lord and he 
counted to him for righteousness.

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,910
Seeing that this,
this,

11
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,070
this is the covenant idea,
this belief,

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,340
because here's the belief.
It's the willingness to act as if the 

13
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:44,760
world is constructed so that if you do 
the right thing,

14
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,970
the best possible outcome will occur.
It's a decision.

15
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:51,840
That's the covenant,
right?

16
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:56,841
So decision about how to live in the 
world because the evidence can't be 

17
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:58,140
there before you make the decision,
right?

18
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,880
And so you might hedge your bets.
You know when,

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,300
when Christ comes back in the book of 
revelation to judge people because he 

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,601
comes back as a judge and virtually 
everyone gets cast out with the chaff 

21
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:13,510
and not saved with the wheat,
and he says something very interesting.

22
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:15,700
He appears in division with a sword 
coming out of his mouth.

23
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:19,110
It's a horrifying vision and he divides 
the,

24
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,710
the he divides humanity into the damned 
and the save or the day.

25
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,090
Yes,
the damned and the saved.

26
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,390
He says something very interesting.
He says

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,280
to those who were neither hot nor cold,
I will spew you out of my mouth.

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,830
And,
and it's,

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,770
it's a,
it's a,

30
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,930
it's a disgust metaphor.
Right?

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,980
And what it says is that the worst 
punishment isn't waiting for those who 

32
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,210
committed to something and did wrong.

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:58,010
The worst punishment is reserved for 
those who committed to nothing and 

34
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,600
stayed on the fence.
And that's really something to.

35
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,630
That's really something to think about.
And it's also something that I believe 

36
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,151
to be true because I see that stacy,
this is utterly destructive because 

37
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:13,020
there's no progress.
All the resist movement backwards.

38
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:15,630
There's aging and suffering and no 
progress.

39
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:18,750
And so to not commit to anything is the 
worst of all.

40
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:23,751
Transgressions.
To commit means to put your body and 

41
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:27,951
soul into something.
To offer your life as a sacrifice means 

42
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:30,711
that you're willing to make a bargain 
with fate and the bargain is I'm going 

43
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:34,431
to act as if if I give it my all,
then the best possible thing will happen

44
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:39,741
because of that and to not see the 
analogy between that and the the active 

45
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:46,071
faith in God is to misunderstand the 
story completely and it has to be an 

46
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:47,400
active faith because how are you going 
to know?

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,600
You can look at other people,
but that isn't going to do it.

48
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:54,210
It's at Kierkegaard was very clear about
this sort of thing.

49
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:59,211
There's certain sorts of truth that you 
can only learn for yourself through 

50
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:02,481
experience.
And that's of course why Abraham also 

51
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:02,481
has to go out alone,
right?

52
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:03,250
He has to leave this candidates.
It's an individual.

53
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,970
It's the individuation process like 
dying.

54
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:11,971
It's something that you do alone.
There's no way you can tell what is 

55
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:12,340
within your grasp,
let's say,

56
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,490
unless you make the ultimate sacrifice 
and there's no way of finding out 

57
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,110
without actually making it,
and so that's the sacrificial act,

58
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:20,890
right?
That's,

59
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,900
that's really emphasized in the act of 
Abraham being called upon to sacrifice.

60
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:28,780
Isaac,
you think about that is Abraham,

61
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:33,781
he's been doing.
He's been like breaking himself into 

62
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:36,721
pieces,
trying to progress forward through 

63
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:39,421
starvation and tyranny and war and 
deceit and the potential loss of his 

64
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:43,321
wife and childlessness and like 
everything that can really be fall you 

65
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:43,321
in some sense.

66
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:45,760
And finally God grants him Isaac when 
he's old,

67
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:47,680
it's impossibly gets Isaac,
his son,

68
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,200
and then what does God do next is say,
well,

69
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:51,850
you know,
that son that you've been waiting for.

70
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:55,900
So for so long it's like,
I'd like to see just exactly what you're

71
00:03:55,901 --> 00:04:00,901
made of.
So I think you should offer him up as a 

72
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:02,800
sacrifice.
And I mean it's a very barbaric story in

73
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,800
a sense,
and maybe in more than just the sense,

74
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,100
but Abraham does maintain his covenant.
He's willing to make the sacrifice he's 

75
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:14,650
made,
willing to make.

76
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,560
This is the thing,
he's willing to make whatever sacrifices

77
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,900
necessary to keep his covenant with God 
in Tack,

78
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,280
and that's that.
