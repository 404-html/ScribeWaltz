1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,040
Well,
so what happens with with Abraham?

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,220
Well,
he's at home and these angels show up.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:08,480
Now

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,850
we don't know whether they're angels or 
men precisely because while as this part

5
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:20,551
of the story reads,
as the Lord appeared to him in the 

6
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:21,550
plains of camera and he sat in the tent 
door in the heat of the day,

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,880
so he's another visionary state by the,
by all appearances,

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,090
and he lifted up his eyes and looked and
lo three men stood by him.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,240
There's real ambivalence in the story 
about the man or the three men are the 

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,690
three angels are there to angels and 
God.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,740
It's all mixed up in the story.
So we will clarify that.

12
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:42,730
We'll leave it ambiguous and I think the
ambiguity is important because you don't

13
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:47,140
know who the stranger is when you 
encounter them and it depends on whether

14
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:48,010
you're thinking about it

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,920
in the normative manner or if you're 
thinking about it in the transcendent 

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,440
manner.
Because with each person that you meet,

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,550
well,
they're just a person.

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,930
That's one way of thinking about it and 
then they're the person that you know or

19
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:05,931
they're the person as they choose to 
reveal themselves to you when people 

20
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:10,131
keep themselves shielded,
but then there also something of great 

21
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:11,460
metaphysical potential,
right?

22
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:12,480
And you might say,
well,

23
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,340
do you believe that?
And I would say,

24
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,900
well,
yes,

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,930
you believe it because you expect a lot 
from people generally speaking and are 

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,050
not happy if they betray you,
but more importantly,

27
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,410
our entire culture is predicated on the 
idea that each person has an indefinite 

28
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,730
intrinsic worth.
And I'm not talking about self esteem.

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,440
I'm talking about something like the 
what,

30
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,860
what,
what would you say it?

31
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,900
The implicit presupposition in our legal
structure that no matter who you are,

32
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:43,260
even if you're a murderer,
even if you're a condemned murderer,

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,680
that there's something about you that's 
of transcendent value that has to be 

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,430
respected by the law,
by the law and by other people.

35
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,600
Right?
And so that's,

36
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:53,400
that's a remark.
And you might say,

37
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,450
well,
you know,

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,370
do I believe that the answer that is,
well,

39
00:01:56,371 --> 00:02:01,371
you act it out because you follow the 
law and it's not an easy thing to pull 

40
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,971
out of the law.
It's kind of the idea that you have 

41
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:06,951
intrinsic natural rights and you don't 
pull that out of our law man without 

42
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:09,750
having the whole thing fall down.
And I think the whole idea that you have

43
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:14,751
intrinsic natural rights is predicated 
on something like the biblical 

44
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,940
hypothesis that human beings have,
a logos nature and that we are involved 

45
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:24,730
in this speaking forth of being and as 
beings who are,

46
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,330
who are involved in this speaking forth 
of being.

47
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,530
There's something about us that has to 
be respected by,

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,110
by ourselves,
in relationship to ourselves,

49
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,210
by ourselves,
in relationship to other people,

50
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:41,130
but even more strangely by ourselves in 
relationship to even to criminals,

51
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:42,600
even to vicious criminals.

52
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,860
You can't remove that transcendent 
element and that's that to me,

53
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:51,861
that's also a mirror,
a miracle of conceptualization because 

54
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:52,170
who the hell is going to think that up?
Right?

55
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Even the most vicious of murderers has a
touch of the transcendent that needs to 

56
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:00,700
be respected of all the ideas that are 
unlikely,

57
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,090
that's going to top the list,
and of course without that,

58
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,460
you have a very barbaric legal system,
right?

59
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:09,370
Because no one is protected.
As soon as you make a mistake,

60
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:11,980
then you're in the dam,
then you have no rights whatsoever,

61
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,580
and that isn't what happens in the West,
which is an absolutely amazing thing.

62
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,950
So anyways,
Abraham is a master of the stranger.

63
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,980
That's one way of thinking about it.
He knows what to do when strangers come 

64
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:32,401
along and he opens his.
He opens himself up to them and I would 

65
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:33,220
say he does that.

66
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,590
We know he's not a naive guy,
Abraham,

67
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,940
right?
He's no weakling.

68
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,070
A couple of stories ago,
he took a big army and went and harassed

69
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,620
a bunch of kings and took his nephew 
back.

70
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:46,390
He's,
he's a tough guy.

71
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,750
And so if stranger show up and he 
welcomes them,

72
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,050
it's not because he couldn't do 
otherwise.

73
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,320
He could certainly do otherwise,
and it's not because he isn't aware of 

74
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,830
what people can be like.
He's perfectly aware of what people can 

75
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,531
be like,
but he determines to take a particular 

76
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:06,880
attitude towards them and that is to 
welcome them and so and why would you do

77
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:11,881
that?
And I think the answer to that is you 

78
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:16,110
hold out your hand in trust to someone 
and you evoke the best from them if 

79
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:20,590
that's there to be given.
So it's an act of courage.

80
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,290
It's like it's.
It isn't me meeting you.

81
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,210
Exactly,
not exactly.

82
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:30,211
It's more like the transcendent part of 
me making a gesture that allows the 

83
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:34,030
transcendent part of you to step forward
and that happens all the time.

84
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,180
It happens all the time in normative 
discourse.

85
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:42,181
You know this perfectly well because 
sometimes you can have a real casual 

86
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:42,550
conversation with someone that just goes
nowhere,

87
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:45,070
right?
It's just shallow as can be or now,

88
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:47,350
and then you can actually make contact 
with someone.

89
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,760
Right?
And you're both,

90
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,580
I would say enlightened and Ennobles by 
the conversation and that's a deal.

91
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,630
We would call that a deep conversation 
fruit for some reason because we made a 

92
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,770
deep connection.
Whatever that means,

93
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:04,771
it means well.
It certainly means that it's not 

94
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,931
shallow.
We were not sure about what these 

95
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:06,940
metaphor means,
but it means that it reaches deep inside

96
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:07,900
of you.
It's something like that.

97
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:12,901
You make direct person to person contact
and those sorts of conversations are,

98
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,710
I'm replenishing that that's the right 
way to think about it.

99
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,710
They they genuinely are and I think 
that's because they provide you with 

100
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,551
that bread that's not material bread and
that's the information that you need to 

101
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,340
to thrive and to put yourself together 
and so it does matter how you meet 

102
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:37,681
someone and it doesn't matter how you 
treat them when you first meet them and 

103
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:40,951
it's amazing.
I've learned to do this at least in 

104
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:43,681
part,
partly because I'm a clinical 

105
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:45,421
psychologist.
I've learned how to talk to people very 

106
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:47,401
rapidly and I have the most amazing 
adventures with people in cabs and when 

107
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:51,571
I travel because I'll talk to them 
directly right away and they'll tell me 

108
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:55,081
the wildest stories and show me the 
craziest things because I'm actually 

109
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:56,830
interested in what they have to say and 
I'm not afraid.

110
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,670
Well,
I'm somewhat afraid,

111
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,490
but I'm not.
I'm not sufficiently afraid to have that

112
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:05,600
stopped me and I'm acting on the 
presupposition that

113
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,720
the person has something of great 
interest to reveal and that's a very 

114
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,591
useful thing to know too,
because one of the things that's really 

115
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:18,201
cool about people that are you really 
learned this as a clinical psychologist 

116
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:18,900
is that if you can get people talking,
they're so damn interesting.

117
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:21,270
You can hardly stand it.
You know,

118
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:24,390
because they have these idiosyncratic 
experiences that are only.

119
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,500
There's only.
There's personally no one else could 

120
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:29,610
tell the story and that's the kind of 
stories that you want to hear.

121
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,580
And when they tell you those stories,
you learn something you didn't know.

122
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,880
And so what that means is that you can 
treat the landscape of strangers as an 

123
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,830
endless vista of places to learn things 
you didn't know.

124
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,970
And if you know enough so that you're 
satisfied with your life and everything 

125
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,560
has ceased to be a tragedy around you.
Well then you can be comfortable in your

126
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,820
circumscribed domain of totalitarian 
knowledge,

127
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:54,360
let's say.

128
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,570
But if you're.
If your life is insufficient and you're 

129
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,780
suffering more than you want to and 
everything isn't what it should be,

130
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:05,781
then you need to look where you haven't 
looked for what you don't have and then 

131
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:08,850
you can look outside beyond you and then
you can make friends with what you don't

132
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:13,851
understand,
and that's a huge part of what this 

133
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,421
story's about because what happens is 
that Abraham welcomes the men,

134
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,550
God angels and treats them very well and
reaps a tremendous benefit as a 

135
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:23,610
consequence,
and then,

136
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,150
well then the story reverses and we end 
up in Sodom and Gomorrah were the same 

137
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,030
angels sojourn and they're treated 
terribly and all hell breaks loose,

138
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,100
and so that's what the story's about.
It's fundamentally now there's A.

139
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,100
There's a sexual impropriety thing going
on that I'm also going to delve into,

140
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:43,680
but I don't think that's the critical 
issue in the story.

141
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:48,681
The critical issue in the story is how 
do you act in the face of the stranger?

142
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,090
You know there's a statement in the New 
Testament,

143
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,000
Christ says something like,
when you,

144
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,000
when you do something to the least of 
people,

145
00:07:58,001 --> 00:08:02,530
you do it to me.
Him Right,

146
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,820
and that's a very

147
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,260
difficult statement to understand too,
but it's something like it's something 

148
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,600
reminiscent of the requirement to keep 
the idea of the transcendent reality of 

149
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:21,631
the person in mind at the same time.
You keep their proximal reality in mind 

150
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:25,770
to have to have your mind in two places 
at the same time when you're talking to 

151
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:26,260
people,

152
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:35,040
you know,
I learned from a friend of mine in 

153
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,141
Montreal who's very socially 
sophisticated and in some ways,

154
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,010
um,
whenever,

155
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,250
whenever he went into a star wars,
like going shopping with him and 

156
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,610
whenever he went into a store and he 
talked and he had an interaction with a 

157
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,561
clerk,
the first thing he would do is have an 

158
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:52,561
interaction with the clerk.
You know,

159
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:54,070
he wouldn't have any interaction with 
the role of the clerk.

160
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,540
He'd like look at the person,
sort of take stock of the fact that they

161
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:02,541
were there and then ask them something 
genuine about their job or their store,

162
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,960
how they were doing,
like go into a conversation right away 

163
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,380
and he didn't get personal about it 
because that can be intrusive.

164
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:15,381
Right?
Do you have to be very sophisticated to 

165
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:16,911
do this?
But he did indicate to the person that 

166
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,300
he was there,
at least in part for the good that could

167
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,690
be done between them.
It's something like that.

168
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,960
And then the person would be 
ridiculously helpful,

169
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,280
you know,
and,

170
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,940
and so then you know,
if people mistreat you,

171
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:37,490
you see this with anti social kids.
It's very tragic thing to see because if

172
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:40,130
you're an antisocial child by the time 
you were above four,

173
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,280
your very hostile and distrustful to 
people and so you'd like a growling 

174
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,020
puppy and if you're a growling puppy,
you tend not to get petted.

175
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:51,530
You're more likely to get kicked.
And if you're growling puppy and you get

176
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:53,960
kicked and you have even more reason to 
grow.

177
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,390
And that's sort of the story of 
antisocial kids.

178
00:09:56,391 --> 00:10:01,391
If they're not well socialized by the 
time they're four and they're more on 

179
00:10:01,391 --> 00:10:03,890
the aggressive side than they alienate 
themselves from the community.

180
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,980
And all they get is rejection while.
And then they look at the rejection and 

181
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,900
they think,
well hell with humanity.

182
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,150
You know,
and no wonder they think that.

183
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:16,810
But,
but the part of the catastrophe is,

184
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:21,811
is that they get what they evoke and,
and I'm not saying it's their fault 

185
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,330
precisely,
but it doesn't matter.

186
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,970
That's still what happens.
And so you might ask yourself,

187
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,180
if you're not getting from people what 
you need,

188
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,750
there is some possibility that you're 
not approaching,

189
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,450
especially if this happens to you 
repeatedly across people.

190
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:40,630
And this is a virtual certainty.
If it happens to you repeatedly across 

191
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,021
people,
especially if you have the same bad 

192
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:44,021
experience with people,
it's not them,

193
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:46,610
it's you.
I would say three is the limit.

194
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,830
If something happens to you,
once

195
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,690
you write it off,
if it happens to you twice,

196
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,780
it's like you open your eyes,
but you write it off.

197
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,960
But if it happens to you three times,
it's probably you or as the rest of the 

198
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:06,931
world better.
It's you because you're not going to 

199
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:06,931
change the rest of the world.
