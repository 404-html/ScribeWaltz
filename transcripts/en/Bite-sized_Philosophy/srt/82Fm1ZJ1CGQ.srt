1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,660
When I talked to people about doing the 
future authoring program,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,110
they often put it off and it's not 
surprising because it's hard and and be,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,420
but it's more than that.
They think,

4
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:10,620
well,
I don't know how to write.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,610
I'm going to do a bad job.
I don't really like assignments.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,790
I'm going to have to do it perfectly.
I need to wait until I have enough time 

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,380
and like one of those is enough to stop 
you cold and all five of them you're 

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,420
just done.
And so I tell people do it haphazardly,

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,120
a tiny bit at a time and badly because 
you can do that.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,420
I tell my students when they're doing 
their thesis master's thesis,

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,410
write a really bad first draft and then 
we have a little conversation about that

12
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:45,411
because they don't think I mean that 
because it sounds like a cliche in some 

13
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:46,560
sense.
It's not a cliche.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,450
It's not a cliche at all.
It means

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,560
you're a terrible writer,
but.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,500
But if someone put a gun to your head 
and said,

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,640
you have to have your a hundred page 
thesis done by next Monday,

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,120
or I'll shoot you,
but I don't care how terrible it is,

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,240
you would sit down and write it,
and the thing is,

20
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:09,090
then you have it right then,
then you have something and then you can

21
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:11,160
fix it.
You can iterate and fix it.

22
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,070
That bad first draft.
That's the most valuable thing.

23
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:19,071
And so that's what you need.
You need a bad first draft of yourself 

24
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:23,330
and there's.
There's an idea in the young developed 

25
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:23,910
about the trickster and the gesture,
the comedian,

26
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:28,911
right?
That the trickster is the precursor to 

27
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:31,431
the savior.
That's one of the things I learned from 

28
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:33,831
young that was just.
It's so unlikely you'd never think that 

29
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:34,560
it's so amazing that that might be the 
case,

30
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,760
but the,
the,

31
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,640
the,
the,

32
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,340
the,
the satirical in the erotic and the,

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,510
and the troublemaker that the comedian,
the fool,

34
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,120
the fool is the precursor to the savior.

35
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:50,330
Why?
Because you're a fool when you start 

36
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,491
something new,
and so if you're not willing to be a 

37
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:52,491
fool,
then you'll never start anything new,

38
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:53,640
and if you never started anything new,
then you won't develop.

39
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:58,080
And so the willingness to be a fool is 
the precursor to transformation.

40
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,290
And that's the same as humility.
And so if you're going to write your 

41
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:03,330
destiny,
you can do a bad first job.

42
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,880
You're gonna.
Get smarter as you move forward.

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,850
That's the thing is that so something 
beckons to you.

44
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:13,851
That's what happens here.
Maybe the star that you pedal wished on 

45
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:15,330
was the wrong damn star,
but at least it was a star,

46
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,400
right?
At least it was in the sky.

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,690
At least it moved him forward.
And so you say in your life or something

48
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,500
grips you and fills you with interest 
and you think,

49
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:26,430
well,
should I do that?

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,370
And the answer is,
if not that,

51
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:33,270
then something.
What if it's a mistake?

52
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,150
It's a mistake.
Rest assured.

53
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,670
What do you know?
You're going to stumble around,

54
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:40,380
right?
And what's going to happen is this.

55
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,110
You're going to move to.
You're going to not stay in spaces,

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,790
you're not going to wander around in 
circles,

57
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,620
and I see people like that.
They said,

58
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:47,640
well,
I never knew what to do,

59
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:51,300
and now I'm 40.
It's like that's not so good,

60
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,180
not so good,
and you might say,

61
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:56,480
well,
and there is literature to that suggests

62
00:02:56,481 --> 00:03:01,481
that people are a lot more unhappy when 
they look back in their lives about the 

63
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:07,081
things they didn't do than they are 
about the mistakes they made while they 

64
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:10,981
were doing things,
and so that's really worth thinking 

65
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:13,561
about too because there's redemptive 
mistakes and a redemptive mistake would 

66
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,850
be a mistake that you make when you go 
out and try to do something.

67
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,110
You know you actually,
you think,

68
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:18,430
okay,
I'm going to try to do this.

69
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,950
When you're not good at it,
you make a bunch of mistakes.

70
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:21,530
It's like,
well,

71
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,570
what's the consequence if you pay 
attention is you're not quite so stupid 

72
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,910
anymore.
That's the thing is you've been informed

73
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:29,890
by your,
by the results of your errors,

74
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:33,850
and so what happens is you follow the 
beacon,

75
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:37,390
you follow the light and you're blind so
you don't know where the light is.

76
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:40,930
It's dimly apprehended only and you're 
afraid to follow it,

77
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,080
but you decided to take some stumbling 
steps towards it and as you take 

78
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,941
stumbling steps towards it,
you become illuminated and enlightened 

79
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:52,780
and informed because of the nature of 
your experience,

80
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:57,781
because you're pushing yourself beyond 
where you are and you're going into the 

81
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:59,020
country that you have not yet been in 
and you learn something,

82
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,660
and so what happens then is the star 
moves.

83
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,090
You move 10 feet towards it and you 
think,

84
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:04,990
no,
that's not right.

85
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,640
I didn't get it right.
It isn't there.

86
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:08,970
It's actually there,
and so then you,

87
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,210
you see it somewhere else and you shift 
yourself slightly and you move forward 

88
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:14,350
and that's what happens is that

89
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,500
you continue as you changed the thing 
that guides you forward,

90
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,210
moves,
right?

91
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:25,500
It's like God in the,
in the,

92
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,780
in the desert,
in Egypt,

93
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:28,340
the pillar of light that you're 
following,

94
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:31,040
it's moving.
It's not a permanent thing.

95
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,050
You move towards it,
it moves away,

96
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:35,390
it guides you forward,
and so you say,

97
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:39,110
well,
is what I'm aiming at paradise itself,

98
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,510
and the answer to that is no,
because what do you know?

99
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:44,420
You see you couldn't see paradise if it 
was right in front of you,

100
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,690
but you might get a glimmer of it and so
you move towards it and you grow and 

101
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,551
then the next time you open your eyes 
you see a little bit more clearly and 

102
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:56,150
that's what happens is that just happens
over and over,

103
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,710
right?
It keeps moving

104
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,850
and so you move like this,
but the thing that's so cool is that all

105
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:08,010
those zigs and zags you say on each of 
those Zags,

106
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,650
zigs is a catastrophe.
I hit a wall,

107
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:13,020
my God,
and then I had to die a little bit and I

108
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,930
barely got back up.
It's a phoenix transformation at each,

109
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,540
at each turn,
and it's painful,

110
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,880
but the thing is is that even though 
you've.

111
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,290
You've traveled 20 miles,
let's say on that road and you've only 

112
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,120
moved three miles forward,
you've moved three miles forward instead

113
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:35,121
of falling backwards.
Because that's the thing too is that if 

114
00:05:35,121 --> 00:05:35,460
you stand still,
you fall backwards.

115
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,570
You cannot stand still because the world
moves away from you.

116
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:42,480
If you stand still and there's no 
spaces,

117
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,840
there's only backwards and so if you're 
not moving backward,

118
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:47,160
back,
forwards,

119
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:52,161
then you're moving backwards and that's 
more more of the underlying truth of the

120
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,630
matthew principle to those who 
everything more will be given from those

121
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:01,730
who have nothing.
Everything will be taken.

122
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,330
It's a warning.
Do not stay in one place.

123
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,790
Well as you zig and zag,
maybe the maybe the cataclysm of each 

124
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,370
transformation starts to lessen.
There's not so much of you that has to 

125
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:19,370
die with every mistake

126
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,930
and maybe you end up oriented at least 
reasonably properly.

127
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,990
And if you were sensible,
that would have been your trip,

128
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,020
but it wasn't right.
It's that and perhaps it's a lot worse 

129
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,691
than that.
Perhaps there's no shortage of 

130
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:35,691
backtracking,
but it doesn't matter.

131
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:36,610
Because as you stumble forward,
you,

132
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,930
you illuminated and inform yourself.
And perhaps that's partly because the 

133
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,671
world is made of information and if you 
encounter it and tangle with it,

134
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,820
then it informs you and then you become 
informed and then your information and 

135
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,730
then you're ready.
