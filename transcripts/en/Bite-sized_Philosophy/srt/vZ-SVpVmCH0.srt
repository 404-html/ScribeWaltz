1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,900
I'm unwilling to deny the existence of 
free choice merely because I don't 

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,960
understand it because it looks to me 
like that's how people are,

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,050
that's how they expect to be treated and
that societies who structure themselves 

4
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:20,241
in accordance with the idea that people 
have free choice actually work now that 

5
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:24,831
doesn't prove that there's free choice,
but people have been arguing about that 

6
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:24,831
forever.
So,

7
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:29,660
but it looks to me.
So those are two possible means of 

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,361
integration and that I think what you're
doing is feeding one or the other 

9
00:00:32,361 --> 00:00:37,160
constantly.
And I think you probably choose which 

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,370
one to feed.
I think that's,

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,130
and I mean that's how it feels that way 
to me as well.

12
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:43,440
Like when I look at my own,
you know,

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,950
maybe you're really aggravated with 
something.

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,980
Maybe you're aggravated with your wife,
you know,

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,160
or,
or,

16
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,190
or your child or something like that,
you know,

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,470
and you're feeling kind of nasty and 
maybe even know that you're in the wrong

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,070
and an idea comes into your head.

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,070
You can think I could say that and you 
know,

20
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:04,140
you could say it and you know what it 
would do,

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,420
but then you pause and you think,
would that make it better or worse?

22
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:12,900
And then maybe you go to hell with it,
which is quite the thing to say.

23
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:17,190
I've got a little story about that in a 
minute and then you say it,

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,330
but you knew,
you knew that you took the low road,

25
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,350
right,
and you know it and then you're guilty 

26
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,180
about that and defensive and that makes 
the fight way works because then there's

27
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:32,181
no damn way you're going to admit that 
you actually did that and so things do 

28
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:32,910
go to hell.
And so.

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,130
So here's,
here's an ugly little idea.

30
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,480
So that's,
that's,

31
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,610
that's relevant to the question.
So imagine you're playing around with 

32
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:47,631
cocaine.
Now I'm using cocaine because it's very 

33
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:52,131
addictive,
but it's a very interesting chemical 

34
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:52,131
because it's a dopaminergic agonist.

35
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:54,750
And what,
what dopamine does is two things.

36
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:57,240
It makes you feel like what you're doing
is worthwhile,

37
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,540
but it also imagine that there's a bunch
of neurocircuits that are active and 

38
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,221
then they get a hit of dopamine or you 
do in those neurocircuits get a little 

39
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:08,910
bit more powerful.
Okay,

40
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:13,911
so it.
It has a rewarding property which is 

41
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:17,031
that it makes you feel like what you're 
doing is important and it has a 

42
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:19,650
reinforcing property which is.
It makes neurocircuits growth.

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,920
So now what that means is that whatever 
you were doing just before you took 

44
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,300
cocaine,
grows.

45
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,650
Okay?
So now imagine there's a bunch of 

46
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:33,650
different things that you do just before
you take cocaine,

47
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,870
but there's a string of decisions and it
one decision point is the same for all 

48
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:44,001
of those difference occurrences.
And that decision point is because you 

49
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:46,140
know you're in trouble and that decision
point is well to hell with it.

50
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,550
Okay?
So then you think that each of the 200 

51
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,150
times that you take cocaine,
even though you do it different places,

52
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,190
but that one thought is there all the 
time and that thing grows because you're

53
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,450
reinforcing it and it grows and it 
grows.

54
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,540
And it grows,
and so now that's in you,

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,800
that's part of you.
And it's the thing that says to hell 

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:08,800
with it,
okay,

57
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,471
so now,
and maybe that's not such a good thing 

58
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:14,710
to grow inside your brain.
So then you,

59
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,740
you're addicted and they take you to a 
cocaine treatment center.

60
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:20,110
And after a week you're no longer 
physically,

61
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,960
physiologically addicted.
You're not craving.

62
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,170
You don't have a problem as long as 
you're there.

63
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,380
But then they take you back to your 
normal environment and you see like 

64
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,380
cocaine,
Joe,

65
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,420
you're a friend.
And as soon as you see him up,

66
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:35,740
that thing comes in,
Bang,

67
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:40,741
you're back on the back on the to hell 
with a track and that's while you're in 

68
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,650
will,
you're where you will end up too.

69
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,980
If you reinforce that particular 
perspective long enough.

70
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,480
So that's a ken in a sense to the this 
decision making process.

71
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,670
You know,
if you,

72
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,820
if you take the low road,
then that winds and it gets a little 

73
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,371
stronger because everything that wins 
neurologically gets a little stronger.

74
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:08,641
It's like a Darwinian competition.
So one rule is don't practice what you 

75
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:11,710
don't want to become because you really 
do become that.

76
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:16,711
It builds,
it builds itself right into your neural 

77
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:19,381
architecture.
And that's one of the terrifying things 

78
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:19,381
about addiction,
you know,

79
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:19,381
because you think,
well,

80
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:20,140
it's kind of psychological.
It's like,

81
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,370
yeah,
kind of.

82
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,640
It's also kind of neurophysiological and
you build a one eyed cocaine monster in 

83
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,850
your head if you hit yourself enough 
with something that reinforcing.

84
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,920
So yeah.

85
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,300
Thank you.
