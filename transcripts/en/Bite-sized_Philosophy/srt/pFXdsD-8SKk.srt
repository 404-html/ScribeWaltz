1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,900
I read it,
wrote,

2
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:04,620
read a very interesting book awhile back
called the wealth and poverty of nations

3
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:09,621
that was written by a Harvard emeritus 
professor of history and one of the 

4
00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:10,890
things that he claimed I liked it.
I thought it was very smart,

5
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:14,100
was that the only true natural 
resources,

6
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:17,580
interpersonal trust.
If you can set up a society where people

7
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:19,920
trust each other,
then it will instantly become rich.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,190
And he used the example of Japan,
which is a very conscientious society 

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,420
and very rich society,
but the Japanese have no natural 

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,420
resources,
right?

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,500
None to speak of and yet the rich and 
then you have countries like the Soviet 

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,450
Russia and much of South America where 
there's just natural resources,

13
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:38,580
but you know,
they're just like Venezuela.

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,890
Just more natural resources.
Then you know what to do with and the 

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,430
places are absolute catastrophes.
My absolute catastrophes of cynicism and

16
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:47,970
corruption.

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,390
And so he attempted to document the 
relationship between default 

18
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,970
interpersonal trust among citizens 
within countries and their,

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,070
their productivity in their,
their GDP and their standard of living 

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,180
and found a very,
very tight relationship.

21
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:08,181
And,
and I liked that a lot and I've got a 

22
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:08,340
story about that quickly that I think is
very interesting.

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll tell you two stories.
One sort of generic,

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,600
I'll tell you one personal first.
So one day I lend my car to one of my 

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,290
graduate students and he took it to 
Montreal,

26
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,350
is this old Cadillac and he got it was a
really bad rainstorm in Montreal and he 

27
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:30,021
was in one of the highways that are like
set into the ground and it was like six 

28
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,860
inches of water and he was turning a 
corner,

29
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:36,861
hit the brakes and skidded on the water 
and smacked it into the wall and on the 

30
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:37,260
corner of the,
of the bumper,

31
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:37,560
you know.

32
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,500
And so then he brought it back and he 
was very apologetic about it.

33
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:41,590
And,
and uh,

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,880
his name was matt shade tell you that 
because Matt might hear this and I can 

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,210
shame them and bit for doing this 20 
years ago,

36
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:49,440
you know,
and uh,

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,500
he's a professor at the Ontario 
Institute of Technology I think now and 

38
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,280
quite a successful one.
But anyways,

39
00:01:56,281 --> 00:02:00,840
he brought the car back and I went and 
got it evaluated for damages,

40
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:03,730
it was like $1,700
or something to repair it and,

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,110
or maybe more,
but it was almost as much as the car was

42
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:08,310
worth.
And I thought,

43
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:13,311
well I'm not gonna do that.
So I went online and I typed in the part

44
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,770
and uh,
if you do that you can get people to bid

45
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:19,530
on sending you used part from all over 
North America.

46
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:24,531
So that's Kinda cool.
So there's all these junk dealers have 

47
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:24,750
got together and they have this network 
of communication.

48
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,940
So you put in the car part and then they
send you a bit.

49
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,920
And so this guy said,
well,

50
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:31,980
I'll send you that bumper assembly,
which is the whole bumper and the lights

51
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,830
for like 250 bucks.
And I thought,

52
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:35,400
yeah,
okay,

53
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,780
you could do that,
that'd be good.

54
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,140
So then I said yes.
And then he called me up about half an 

55
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,640
hour later if this guy from way down 
south,

56
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,900
he had a really deep sort of Mississippi
accent and he said,

57
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,620
wait a sec,
was that for the bumper or the bumper 

58
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:51,620
assembly?
And I said,

59
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,320
well,
it was for the bumper assembly.

60
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:52,980
He said,
oh,

61
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:54,480
I thought it was for the bumper.
And then he said,

62
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:56,400
but that's okay.
I'll send it to you anyways.

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,530
And I thought,
well that's pretty good.

64
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,800
So said,
well thank you.

65
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:03,490
And then I hung up and then half an hour
later he called me up again and he said,

66
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:08,491
look,
I just went out and looked at that 

67
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:09,841
bumper assembly and there's a plastic 
trim piece on the side and it has a 

68
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:09,841
scratch in it.

69
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:14,310
And I thought,
I better tell you that just in case you 

70
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:14,310
didn't want it.
And I thought,

71
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:14,680
wow,
that's so amazing.

72
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:17,590
It's like there's a miracle man.
It's like this guy,

73
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,560
he's somewhere in Mississippi.
I'm never going to see him again.

74
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,200
Ever.
Never gonna have any contact with them.

75
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,210
Like he made a bad deal.
Right?

76
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:28,180
Because the part was worth more than he 
decided to sell it to me for,

77
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:31,630
but he stuck with this deal and then he 
went over and above the call of duty.

78
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:32,140
He said,
well,

79
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:36,850
this part that I'm selling you to you 
for way less than it's worth is damaged.

80
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,410
So I thought I'd better tell you.
It's like,

81
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,980
man,
you got to recognize a miracle when you 

82
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:43,980
see one that was a miracle.
So I said,

83
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,450
hey look,
it's thanks for calling man.

84
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,290
So okay,
I can handle the scratch.

85
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,290
Send the part.
And he did and I got the car fixed and 

86
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:53,560
forgave Matt and you know,
it had a happy ending.

87
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,630
So.
So that's trust,

88
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,320
right?
Because I didn't know him from Adam and 

89
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,770
he's a primate full of snakes just like 
the rest of us.

90
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,980
And yet he was willing to simplify 
himself to the point where I could just 

91
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,041
take him absolutely at his word.
And that meant we could trade even 

92
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:11,041
though we were strangers.
It's like,

93
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:15,900
man,
do not underestimate the utility of 

94
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:15,900
that.
And then there's Ebay.

95
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,860
When Ebay first started,
you know the idea was not gonna work 

96
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,640
because you'll send me junk and all send
you a check that bounces and that'll be 

97
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:23,640
the end of Ebay,
right,

98
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,650
and so these escrow agents popped up so 
you could insure your transaction with 

99
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,460
them moves for like 10 percent of the 
transaction.

100
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,850
They would get the check and the goods 
and make sure that they were okay and 

101
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,970
then send them on or ensure the 
transaction,

102
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,560
but what happened was the escrow agents 
didn't make any money and the reason for

103
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:45,370
that was no one cheated.
You think about how amazing that is,

104
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:47,650
right?
You bring these people together across a

105
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:49,840
whole continent.
They've never seen each other before.

106
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,000
They're never going to interact with 
each other again,

107
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,760
and this was before there were any 
reputation ratings on Ebay,

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,290
and yet the default transaction was you 
describe your goods honestly,

109
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,260
including their flaws.
You set a reasonable price.

110
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,830
I decided to pay you.
You ship the goods and I pay you,

111
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,130
and it works.
And what happened was that Ebay 

112
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,071
produced,
it produced a tremendous amount of 

113
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:15,240
capital that was previously frozen,
so frozen capitalist.

114
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,250
When you've invested money in something 
but the thing is no longer useful to 

115
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,361
you,
so the money is just sitting there 

116
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:24,361
frozen,
right,

117
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:25,810
so to speak,
and you can't get it loose because,

118
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,820
well,
you've got an attic full of junk.

119
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,620
How are you gonna?
Get rid of that.

120
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,490
Oh,
E bay.

121
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,520
And so all of a sudden all these things 
that were just junk became valuable and 

122
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,030
everybody got richer and none of that 
wouldn't.

123
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:41,031
It would have happened without the 
covenant that we established between 

124
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:44,071
each other that's predicated on trust.
And so you might say that trust is the 

125
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:47,260
currency and currency is trust because 
it's a promissory note,

126
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,640
right?
And if people lie,

127
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,950
then the currency gets debased very,
very rapidly.

128
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,080
And so the economy runs on trust.
