1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,970
Let's say you're miserable and unhappy.
Okay,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,280
here's a cure.
Find what's valuable and let it go.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,470
So we could say,
well,

4
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:15,471
maybe it's a relationship that you have.
Maybe it's relationship with your 

5
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:15,471
parents,
right,

6
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:17,700
and the relationship is pathological,
but you're locked into it.

7
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:22,701
You value it and no wonder because it's 
a relationship with your parents and 

8
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:23,790
your suffering terribly because of it.
Well,

9
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,190
what do you do?
Maybe you let it go.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,890
It's a sacrifice and the idea is that,
well,

11
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:31,140
that'll clear the future for you.
Well,

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,570
very frequently when people are 
suffering terribly,

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,780
not always because sometimes you just 
suffer stupidly,

14
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:41,781
blindly and without recourse,
you know you get cancer and then you 

15
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:45,621
die,
so we have no idea how to deal with 

16
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:48,171
that,
but sometimes the reason that you're 

17
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:50,091
suffering is because you just won't let 
go of the thing that's biting you and 

18
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:50,091
you think,
well,

19
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,780
I can't let go of that,
and I've had clients like this.

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,780
I can't stop communicating with my 
mother who phones me three times a day 

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,020
everyday of my life and never says 
anything that isn't unbelievably 

22
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,540
critical and demeaning.
I can't let that go.

23
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,040
I was like,
wow,

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,690
that's not such a good idea.
The funny thing too,

25
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,760
often when people let something like 
that go,

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,270
it goes away,
sorts itself out and then comes back so 

27
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,961
they don't even end up losing it,
but unless they're willing to let it go 

28
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:18,780
to sacrifice that they make no headway 
whatsoever.

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,200
And so one of the rules is if people are
impeding your development,

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,880
you sacrifice your relationship with 
them,

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,530
right?
It's a very,

32
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:30,720
very rough rule.
So.
