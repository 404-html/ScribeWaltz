1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,580
Stromboli is not happy with the tangled 
mass,

2
00:00:04,581 --> 00:00:09,581
but then the crowd reacts very 
positively and then that confuses the 

3
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:09,581
conscience because he thinks,
well look,

4
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:11,960
this is horrible.
This guy's a tyrant like Pinocchio,

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,930
making a fool of himself.
Everything turns into a tangled mess,

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,140
but the crowd goes crazy and well,
the inner fool,

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,860
that can be entertaining,
right?

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,850
So it's hard to tell when the crowd,
especially out of spectacle,

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,830
because that's this crowd is at a 
spectacle.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,150
You just don't know exactly why it is 
that they're responding positively,

11
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:37,151
but you definitely give them what you 
want and you can see this look on 

12
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:37,340
strombolis face.
It's like this false.

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,950
Again,
this false kindness and generosity,

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,280
public facing and oh well.
Anyways,

15
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:48,281
the conscience is very confused and I 
really think this is an important thing 

16
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:52,361
because I've often thought I spent a lot
of time thinking about Hitler and I was 

17
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:52,361
thinking,
well,

18
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:54,380
how do you get into a state like that?
You know,

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,120
and you think,
well,

20
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,110
he's a dictator and he led his people 
down a bad path.

21
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:01,280
It's like,
that's not right.

22
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:06,281
That is not what happened.
They had a conspiracy together and went 

23
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:09,410
down a bad path.
Now think about it this way.

24
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,930
If one person thinks something about 
you,

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,700
it's like whatever,
right?

26
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,840
But if five people tell you that,
well,

27
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,850
what?
Then then to start to start not taking 

28
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,070
that seriously.
It's kind of narcissistic.

29
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,450
Right?
And if it isn't five,

30
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:30,451
let's say it's 15 people tell you the 
same thing or act the same way towards 

31
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:32,380
you.
It's like probably you should clue in,

32
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,530
well what if you're a politician and 
you're trying out a bunch of different 

33
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,540
ideas and you're good at interacting 
with the crowd,

34
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,730
you're charismatic,
you watch the crowd,

35
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,520
but you're not necessarily all that 
articulate.

36
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,120
You don't have your values all straight 
now,

37
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:52,121
but you're kind of angry too,
and maybe that's because you spent a 

38
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:53,530
bunch of time in World War One,
world war one in the trenches,

39
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,740
which was like no joke and all your 
friends got blown up you and then you 

40
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,001
were unemployed and then you tried to be
an artist and that didn't work out even 

41
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,941
though you were moderately talented and 
then maybe the economy fell apart 

42
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:05,941
completely on you.

43
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,100
Hyperinflation and then maybe there was 
a communist menace coming in from the 

44
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,180
east and they're genuinely was and so 
you're not the world's happiest clam at 

45
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,591
that point and you're talking to people 
who aren't that happy either because 

46
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:23,671
they were also badly defeated in world 
war one and then they had a terrible 

47
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:23,671
treaty.
They had decided they lost part of their

48
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:28,591
territory and so the crowd's not happy 
and neither are you and there's reason 

49
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:30,910
for it,
and so you start talking to them.

50
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:34,060
You don't know what you're upset about 
and neither does the crowd,

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,230
so you start to articulate some things 
about why you might be upset and some of

52
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:43,231
them fall flat,
but you're paying attention to the 

53
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,391
crowd,
so you stopped saying those things and 

54
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:47,530
some of the things make the crowd really
wake up and listen,

55
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,930
and so you start seeing more of those 
things.

56
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,540
Right?
It's an.

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,010
It's an unconscious dialectic between 
you and the crowd.

58
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:59,011
It's mediated by consciousness,
but it's not like you're sitting there 

59
00:02:59,011 --> 00:02:59,011
saying,
although you might be,

60
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,970
I'm going to this crowd more what it 
wants to hear.

61
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,420
It's more sophisticated than that,
and so you do that thousand times and 

62
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,831
you do that to ever increasing crowds 
and the crowd really starts to go mad 

63
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,800
and they basically tell you that you're 
the savior of the nation.

64
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,130
It's like at what?
How many bloody people have to tell you 

65
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,300
that before you start to believe it,
you know?

66
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,080
I would say with a typical person,
100,

67
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,310
we'll do it now.
That'll get you going,

68
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:32,311
man.
If 100 people tell you specifically why 

69
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:32,500
you're special,
you're going to be thinking.

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,330
Even if you're kind of humbled to begin 
with,

71
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:35,290
you're going to be thinking,
Geez,

72
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:39,310
there's got to be something to this man,
but if it's a million people and they're

73
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,110
roaring their approval.

74
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,020
Well,
and then when it's a whole nation,

75
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:47,260
it's like good luck withstanding that.
There's just not a chance.

76
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,290
How are you going to withstand that?
Now you could be like Gandhi and you 

77
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:58,261
could have taken that into account 
beforehand because he did he read 

78
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:00,280
tolstoy by the way,
he was a student of tolstoy and that's.

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,400
It's very interesting because tolstoy 
was the person who developed the 

80
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,371
techniques of nonviolence that gone to 
USD and tolstoy was also a deeply 

81
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:12,670
religious writer apart from his novels,
which are not,

82
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,190
I wouldn't say really in the religious 
category,

83
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,600
although they're profound,
um,

84
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:23,790
tolstoy stressed humility with 
nonviolence.

85
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,380
He really stressed that and that's what 
Gandhi took to heart.

86
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,940
So he lived a very,
very,

87
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,890
very,
very simple bare bones,

88
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,950
ascetic life.
And that was to kind of see if he could 

89
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,740
keep his damn ego tamp down.
Well,

90
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:38,490
the groundswell was building behind him,
you know,

91
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,500
when he dressed really simply and he 
didn't own much and he ate very simply 

92
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,510
and he just tried to stay away from the 
whole materialistic success element that

93
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:51,511
would be an element of what would turn 
them into an actor and also inflate his 

94
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:51,511
ego.

95
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:52,300
And you know,
he seemed to do that pretty well.

96
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,200
You know,
he certainly.

97
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,610
Well,
he led a nonviolent revolution that 

98
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,160
resulted in the,
in the independence of India.

99
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,310
It also produced a terrible civil war 
and the separate separation of the 

100
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,980
Muslim Indians from the Hindu Indians.
And,

101
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,900
but I don't think you can precisely laid
out at the feet of Gandhi,

102
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,430
right?
But,

103
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,130
but what I'm saying is that you have to 
be an extraordinary person.

104
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:20,131
You have to be extraordinarily wise and 
you have to take ridiculous precautions 

105
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:24,150
if you're going to put yourself in the 
public sphere like that and expose 

106
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,170
yourself to that kind of adulation 
without becoming a puppet of the crowd.

107
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,010
And that's what happened to Hitler.
I mean it's not like he wasn't also a 

108
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,341
conscious manipulator and surrounded 
himself by people who are propagandists 

109
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:36,430
and all of that.
So there was a conscious element,

110
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:41,431
but you got to think these things 
through and see how that dialectic 

111
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:46,081
develops.
Like he learned how to appeal to the 

112
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:46,690
darkest fantasies of the crowd.
He was really,

113
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:50,170
really good at it and that was a 
dialectic process,

114
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:55,171
right?
The crowd told them what they wanted to 

115
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:55,171
hear and it's the crowds a mob at that 
point.

116
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,240
So I don't have to take responsibility.
The fact that I'm screaming my approval 

117
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,190
when I'm surrounded by a million people 
so I can scream my approval for whatever

118
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:09,191
I want forever.
Whatever dark revengeful fantasy might 

119
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:11,540
be playing out in my imagination because
I'm not going to be held accountable for

120
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:11,660
it.
