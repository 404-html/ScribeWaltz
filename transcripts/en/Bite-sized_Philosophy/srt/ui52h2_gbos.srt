1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,290
Okay,
well I could talk.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,900
Let me talk about the situation at the 
Ivy League universities.

3
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:07,440
First,
the question broadly speaking covers the

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,060
question about intelligence and about 
its diverse manifestations and about its

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,250
role in selection for universities.
Could go back and look at the records at

6
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,380
Harvard for example,
in the early 19 sixties,

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,700
the typical IQ for a Harvard student was
about 100,

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,470
five to 110,
not much above average,

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,040
but that's because they were finishing 
schools for the,

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,090
for the rich,
roughly speaking,

11
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:33,450
and you know your.
If you had a rich father and he made his

12
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:38,451
money,
he was probably well above average in 

13
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:39,390
intelligence,
but if you are his offspring,

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,750
there's regression towards the mean,
so there's no reason to assume that by 

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,650
nature of your position you are going to
be particularly intelligent anyways.

16
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:51,280
The average Ivy League student wasn't,
was bright but not outstanding.

17
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,540
So now it's 100 IQ,
145,

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,090
three standard deviations above the mean
because.

19
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:02,130
And the reason for that is because 
they're selected by the sat scholastic 

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,240
aptitude test.
It's an IQ test.

21
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,850
They won't say it's an IQ test,
but that doesn't matter.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,430
It isn't.
It's an IQ test.

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,330
It's a simple as that.
Any any test that contains a 

24
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:19,461
sufficiently diverse range of problem 
solving questions that's rank ordered 

25
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,620
in,
in,

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,980
in accuracy among people is an IQ test.
The correlations like point eight,

27
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:28,740
five.
So and what has happened.

28
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,190
There's two things that have happened.
I mean the Ivy Leagues have got more and

29
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:35,910
more selective because they can and so 
the average IQ of their students is just

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,260
continued to move upwards and then the 
average IQ of the population is actually

31
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:42,870
increased to a substantive degree to 
over the last 50 years.

32
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:47,871
Partly because partly perhaps mostly 
because of improved nutrition and and 

33
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,210
information exposure along among the.

34
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,550
Like the more deprived members of the 
culture.

35
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,200
It's better to watch tv than to sit 
alone in your crib for example,

36
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,660
an isolated and people have enough food 
now.

37
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:04,290
So the really low end of the 
intelligence spectrum is being truncated

38
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,810
and the general population IQ is 
increased.

39
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,070
So with regards to institutions like the
University of Toronto,

40
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:14,970
say they average IQ at the University of
Toronto with somewhere between 120 130,

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,360
and we know that because we've tested it
and it's not surprising because you're 

42
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,730
basically selected for cognitive 
process,

43
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:22,530
right?
Because grades are rough.

44
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:24,780
Marker of intelligence.
Conscientiousness,

45
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:28,950
by the way also matters independent 
trait because the best two predictors of

46
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:31,380
university grades are conscientiousness 
and intelligence,

47
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,150
not creativity,
by the way,

48
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,010
zero correlation with creativity.
