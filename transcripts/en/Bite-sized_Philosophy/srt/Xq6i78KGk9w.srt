1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,640
Borders are reasonable.
How about that?

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,020
The law is the border that stops someone
from stealing your

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,500
laptop.
If it's an apple laptop,

4
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:27,501
what's the sort of laptop that has 
social justice warrior would carry and 

5
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:31,400
then the social justice warrior is going
to be very irritated if you happen to 

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,030
purloin their laptop and then you might 
point out to them,

7
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:38,031
you know it's a border that protects you
from having that thing taken and they 

8
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:38,820
say,
well,

9
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,560
the borders should be open.
It's okay man,

10
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:45,561
no problem,
and you hand over that laptop right now 

11
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:47,870
and everything else you own too.
If you don't like borders and you can 

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:48,600
get rid of the damn walls in your house 
and you don't need doors on your bedroom

13
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:53,601
either and we can keep an eye on you 
whenever we want and so much for 

14
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:57,171
borders.
One of the things that really differs 

15
00:00:57,171 --> 00:00:59,421
between liberals and conservatives 
between the left and the right is the 

16
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:00,630
right is in the right legs,
tight borders between things.

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,790
It's part of being conscientious at 
every level,

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,530
conceptually,
sexually,

19
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,360
familiarly,
provincially,

20
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:08,010
nationally.
The right says,

21
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:08,760
look,
let's keep.

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,060
Let's keep the borders between things 
pretty distinct and the left says,

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,360
yeah,
maybe not because some of those borders 

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,031
are in the wrong place and a little bit 
more free flow of information wouldn't 

25
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:20,640
be a bad thing,
and the thing is that right,

26
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,460
but so are the Conservatives and that's 
why you have to talk.

27
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:24,030
It's like,
well,

28
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:26,610
we've got some borders.
That's a good thing.

29
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,940
Maybe some of them need to be moved 
around a little bit and that's what the 

30
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,611
political dialogue is for,
but that doesn't mean that borders 

31
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:37,971
themselves are a bad idea.
They're a great idea because without 

32
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:41,961
borders,
everything Nash's into the same 

33
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:43,890
untenable state of undifferentiated 
chaos and you can't live in that.

34
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,640
And so the people who are trying to tear
down the borders conceptually,

35
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:52,641
politically and practically what they 
want is the chaos that that would bring 

36
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:55,320
the either want that or they're too 
foolish to know that their pursuits will

37
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:56,190
produce that.

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,570
So let's,
let's,

39
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,690
let's be a little bit clear that if you 
stand up and say,

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,160
yeah,
borders,

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,900
they're okay,
they've got their problems,

42
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:08,901
but they're okay.
That doesn't make you a bigot beyond 

43
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:13,251
redemption.
It just makes you someone with some 

44
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:16,341
sense and it's actually okay to be 
someone with some sense limits on 

45
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,460
immigration are also reasonable while we
need to figure out what those limits are

46
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,950
and that's what the bloody political 
dialogue is for,

47
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:25,890
but the fact that it should be limited 
to some degree is also reasonable.

48
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:30,891
Otherwise,
why not just open the borders and let 

49
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:30,891
everybody come in?
Well,

50
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:34,941
the reason you don't do that is because 
a complex system cannot tolerate 

51
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,080
extensive transformation over too short 
a period of time.

52
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,260
Now you want immigrants to come in,
especially if they're the sorts of 

53
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,531
immigrants who are likely to contribute 
properly to the success of your policy 

54
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:50,130
and lots of immigrants do that.

55
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,810
I mean,
I think the vast majority,

56
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:56,811
for example,
of entrepreneurs in the United States 

57
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:56,811
come from the Indian subcontinent,
so great.

58
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:57,570
You know,
bring them over.

59
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:00,070
They're highly educated,
they're extraordinarily productive.

60
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,430
They make lots of new businesses and 
then they pump money like back,

61
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,040
like mad back in India.
Good deal.

62
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,250
But that doesn't mean that we have.
We have our arms are open to everyone 

63
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,190
immigration policy because it's complete
rubbish.

64
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,140
All that means is you're not thinking 
about it,

65
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,870
so when here's the coded to that for 
conservatives.

66
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,290
Here's something I've been thinking 
about this a lot lately.

67
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,860
It should not be assumed that citizens 
have societies that have not evolved 

68
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,170
functional individual rights predicated 
polities will hold values in keeping 

69
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:33,160
with such qualities.
So we could say,

70
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:38,161
look,
there are a lot of countries in the 

71
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:41,660
world that are not governed well,
the vast majority of them,

72
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:46,661
right,
and they've been not governed well 

73
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:49,000
forever,
and to me that means that there's 

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,971
something wrong with the values that are
held collectively by the people who've 

75
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:53,540
established those policies.
Well,

76
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,750
you shouldn't be naive and assume that 
merely because you moved them to a new 

77
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,411
country,
they're going to let their innate 

78
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:02,411
democratic longings,
Florida.

79
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,780
It doesn't work that way.
