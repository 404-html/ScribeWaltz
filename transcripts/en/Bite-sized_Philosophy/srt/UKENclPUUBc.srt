1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,680
Consider the lilies of the field,
how they grow.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,800
They toil.
Not Neither do they spin,

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,250
and yet I say unto you that even Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like 

4
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:13,280
one of these.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,040
Wherefore,
if God so clothes the grass of the 

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,050
field,
which today is and tomorrow is cast into

7
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:23,050
the oven,
shall he not much more clothe you,

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,290
oh ye of little faith.
Therefore take no thought saying,

9
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:30,640
what shall we eat or what shall we drink
or wherewithal shall we be closed.

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,330
Those are famous lines and that sort of 
Christ the Hippie,

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,040
right?
It's like,

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,310
Hey,
let it all hang out.

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,670
That's an old phrase.
Do your thing and everything will come 

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,441
to you and these lines have been 
interpreted in that manner many times,

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:55,410
but that's seriously not the proper 
interpretation because there's a kicker 

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,820
with this injunction and the kicker is 
this,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
for your heavenly father,
know that you have need of all these 

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,480
things,
but seek ye first the Kingdom of God and

19
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:12,940
his righteousness and all these things 
shall be added unto you.

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,220
That's a lot different than the hippie 
thing,

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,890
right?
Because there's a very,

22
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:19,870
very,
very interesting idea here.

23
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:24,871
It's,
it's certainly one of the most profound 

24
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:26,680
ideas that I've ever encountered and the
idea is this,

25
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,770
is that if you configure your life so 
that what you are genuinely doing is 

26
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:38,010
aiming at the highest possible good,
then the things that you need to

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,170
to survive and to thrive on a day to day
basis will deliver themselves to you.

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,360
That's a hypothesis and it's not some 
simple hypothesis,

29
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,610
right?
Because what it basically says is if you

30
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:56,610
dare to do the most difficult thing that
you can conceptualize,

31
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,160
your life will work out better than it 
will.

32
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,380
If you do anything else.
Well,

33
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:02,790
how are you going to find out if that's 
true?

34
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,040
Well,
it's a Kierkegaardian leap of faith.

35
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,560
There is no way you're going to find out
whether or not that's true unless you do

36
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:08,990
it.
So no,

37
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,650
no one can tell you either because just 
because it works for someone else.

38
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,990
I mean,
that's interesting and all that,

39
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:17,700
but it's no proof that it'll work for 
you.

40
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:22,701
You have to be all in in this game.
And so the idea is seek ye first the 

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Kingdom of God and his righteousness.
It's like that's actually a fairly 

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,551
important caution when you're talking 
about not having to pay attention to 

43
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:37,101
what you're going to eat or what you're 
going to where it's like what it's 

44
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:40,701
essentially saying is that those 
problems are trivial in comparison and 

45
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:43,500
the probability is that if you manifest 
yourself properly in the world,

46
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,430
that those things will come your way is 
extraordinarily high.

47
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,770
And I believe,
I believe that that's exactly right.

48
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,440
I mean,
I,

49
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,920
I've,
I've watched people operate in the world

50
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,950
and I would say that there is no more 
effective way of operating the world 

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,560
than to conceptualize the highest good 
that you can and then strive to attain 

52
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:09,631
it.
There's no more practical pathway to the

53
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:14,350
kind of success that you could have if 
you actually knew what success was.

54
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,750
And so that's what this,
that's what this sermon is attempting 

55
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:20,750
to,

56
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,140
to posit.
It's like in,

57
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,220
in the story of Pinocchio.
You know what happens at the beginning 

58
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,040
of the story of Pinocchio is that Japan 
wishes on a star.

59
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:37,041
We talked about that a little bit and so
what you pedal does is align himself 

60
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:41,211
with the metaphorical manifestation of 
the highest good he can conceptualize 

61
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,580
and say,
he says he makes sure he makes a 

62
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,790
commitment.
Let's say he aims at the star and for 

63
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,890
him the star is the possibility that he 
can take his creation,

64
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,100
a puppet whose strings are being pulled 
by unseen forces and have it transform 

65
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:01,980
into something that's our economists and
real.

66
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,110
Yeah,

67
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,200
well that's a hell of an ambition.
You know when we're wise enough to put 

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,801
that into children's movie,
but too foolish to understand what it 

69
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:15,671
means.
It's such an interesting juxtaposition 

70
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:15,950
that that we can both know that and not 
know it.

71
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:17,960
At the same time,
you can go to the movie,

72
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:22,961
you can watch it and it makes sense,
but that doesn't mean that you can go 

73
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:22,961
home and think,
well,

74
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:24,680
I know what that meant.
While people are complicated,

75
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,450
right?
We exist at different levels and all the

76
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:28,070
levels don't communicate with one 
another,

77
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:33,071
but.
But the movie is a hypothesis and the 

78
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:36,791
hypothesis is there's no better pathway 
to self realization and the enablement 

79
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:42,821
of being than to pause it,
the highest good that you can conceive 

80
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:45,830
of and commit yourself to it.
And then you might also ask yourself,

81
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:49,640
and this is definitely worth asking,
is do you really have anything better to

82
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:51,410
do?
And if you don't,

83
00:04:51,411 --> 00:04:56,411
well why would you do anything else?
Therefore take no thought for the 

84
00:04:57,151 --> 00:05:02,151
morrow,
for the morrow shall take thought for 

85
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:02,151
the things of itself sufficient unto the
day is the evil thereof.

86
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,480
I spent a long time trying to figure out
what that meant to because it's another 

87
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:08,480
one of those lines that

88
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,460
can easily be read as pro grasshopper,
an anti amped.

89
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,380
You know you remember the old fable of 
the grasshopper in the end,

90
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,240
maybe not,
I'm not going to tell it,

91
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,290
but works and the grasshopper fiddles 
and the ad has a pretty good time in the

92
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:32,121
winter and the grasshopper dies.
And so this is like a pro grasshopper 

93
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:36,081
line,
but it's not because it says something 

94
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:38,331
else.
It says that if you orient yourself 

95
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:38,331
properly

96
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,940
and then pay attention to what you do 
every day that works,

97
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:48,270
and I actually think that that's in 
accordance with what with what we have 

98
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,751
come to understand about human 
perception because what happens is that 

99
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:55,540
the world shifts itself around your aim 
because you're.

100
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,590
You're a creature that has an aim.
You have to have an ame in order to do 

101
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:00,590
something.
You're in aiming creature.

102
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,350
You look at a point and you move towards
it.

103
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,530
It's built right into you and so you 
have a name.

104
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:11,531
Well,
let's say your aim is the highest 

105
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:12,941
possible ame.
Well then so that sets up the world 

106
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:12,941
around you.
It,

107
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:17,600
it organizes all of your perceptions and
organizes what you see and you don't 

108
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,491
see.
It organizes your emotions and your 

109
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:21,680
motivations.
So you organize yourself around that aim

110
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:26,681
and then what happens is the day 
manifests itself as a set of challenges 

111
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:28,940
and problems and if you solve them 
properly,

112
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,210
then you stay on the pathway towards 
that eighth and you can concentrate on 

113
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:34,210
the,
on the,

114
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,650
on the day,
and so that way you get to have your 

115
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:38,650
cake.
And eat it too because you can,

116
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,800
you can point into the distance,
the far distance and you can live in the

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:42,800
day

118
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,950
and it seems to me that that's.
That makes every moment of the day 

119
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,551
supercharged with meaning that that's 
because if everything that you're doing 

120
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:56,860
everyday is related to the highest 
possible aim that you can conceptualize,

121
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:02,070
well,
that's the very definition of the 

122
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,070
meaning that would sustain you in your 
life well,

123
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,210
and then the issue is well back to noah.
Well all hell is about to break loose 

124
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,081
and chaos is coming.
It's like when that's happening in your 

125
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:12,301
life,
you might want to be doing something 

126
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,140
that you regard as truly worthwhile 
because that's what will keep you afloat

127
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,400
when,
when everything is flooded and you don't

128
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:22,210
want to wait until the flood comes to 
start doing that.

129
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:26,500
Because if you're arcs half built and 
you don't know how to captain it,

130
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,780
the probability is very high that

131
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,940
that you'll drown.
