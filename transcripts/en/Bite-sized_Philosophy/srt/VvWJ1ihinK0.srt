1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,670
So now some of the problems with,
with the Marxist perspective seems to be

2
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:10,671
that victimhood,
their sense of enhanced victimhood tends

3
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:15,741
to produce an intense sense of 
resentment and that's a very bad idea 

4
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:17,250
because resentment is a very toxic and 
violent emotion.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,580
It's also very ungrateful,
which is one of the things I would 

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,161
really say about,
especially the radical left student 

7
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:25,680
types,
especially at Ivy League universities.

8
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:30,681
I mean it's really quite a spectacle to 
see people at places like Yale come out 

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,820
and agitate as a consequence of the 
realization of their own oppression when

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,060
by any reasonable standard,
current or historical,

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,210
they're probably in the top one,
100th of a percent at perhaps better 

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,820
than that of all the people who have 
ever lived anywhere ever.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,040
And so it really.
It's really.

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,420
It's really quite staggering to me that 
the top point zero,

15
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,330
zero,
one percent can express their resentment

16
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:59,220
about the top point zero,
zero,

17
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:04,221
zero,
one percent in such strident terms 

18
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:07,641
without noticing that exactly the same 
claims of privilege apply to them by as 

19
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,230
long as all you have to do is transform 
the,

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,480
the,
the bend in which you're doing the 

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,790
privilege comparisons and that becomes 
immediately self evident and you know 

22
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,570
the fact that as Americans,
let's say,

23
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:23,670
or a North American since I'm a 
Canadian,

24
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,730
that were staggeringly privileged 
compared to the rest of the world,

25
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:31,731
is certainly a consequence of the of 
what you might describe as the 

26
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:33,570
arbitrariness of our political borders 
and so,

27
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:38,571
but to forget that when you're claiming 
a particular brand of oppression for 

28
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:42,591
yourself seems to me to be very 
ungrateful at the least and certainly 

29
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:44,970
motivated,
let's say politically because I think it

30
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:49,971
justifies your expression of hatred for 
those tiny fraction of people who are 

31
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:51,180
still better off than you.

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,700
And also a degree of historical 
ignorance.

33
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:58,701
That's absolutely staggering in its 
magnitude and a complete indictment of 

34
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:02,721
our education system,
which should be indicted in every 

35
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:06,081
possible way,
so now the Marxists might claim to their

36
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:13,130
benefit,
let's say with this worldview of class 

37
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:19,161
struggle as being the primary driver of 
human history and the well off 

38
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,220
socioeconomically because that's pretty 
much the only way they define well off,

39
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:28,221
which is also something I take great 
objection to because there's lots of 

40
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:32,240
hierarchies in the world and there are 
many important hierarchies and not all 

41
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,041
of them can be reduced to socioeconomic 
status by any stretch of the 

42
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,611
imagination.
Imagine if you are 80 years old and you 

43
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:40,611
had $20,000,000,
you know,

44
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:45,380
he might be perfectly happy to get rid 
of all that money if you could be 18 

45
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:45,380
again.
So it's.

46
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,241
And you know,
one of the best predictors of wealth in 

47
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:50,480
North America is actually age because 
you know,

48
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:53,130
young people haven't actually had much 
time to make money,

49
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,050
whereas old people have had quite a bit 
of time.

50
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,050
But the problem with being old enriches 
that you're still old and that actually 

51
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,150
turns out to be quite a serious problem 
because no matter how rich you are,

52
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:09,151
you eventually die and so the money is 
the money has a very delimited if 

53
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,280
limited effect with regards to 
addressing the fundamental problems of 

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,261
the suffering of life and we know 
perfectly well from the empirical 

55
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:22,300
perspective that once you have enough 
money so that the bill collectors aren't

56
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:27,301
chasing you around.
Essentially something like the 

57
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:30,301
beginnings of a middle class existence 
or maybe the upper end of the working 

58
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,680
class than additional money has 
absolutely no bearing whatsoever on your

59
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:36,010
psychological wellbeing.
And that's actually an indication of the

60
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:40,600
limitations of material comfort.
Let's say as a medication for the.

61
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,090
For the suffering that's attendant on 
life.

62
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,180
It's another thing that's very weak 
about the Marxists and I think very 

63
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,050
interestingly contradictory because 
they're very anti capital in their 

64
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,551
structure,
but they're so damn materialistic that 

65
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:57,610
it's absolutely mind boggling because 
the Marxists are actually more convinced

66
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:59,680
that money is useful than most 
capitalists.

67
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,680
As far as I can tell.
Because they believe that that money is 

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
in fact the solution to all life's 
problems.

69
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:10,681
The problem is is that just the right 
people don't have the money and I think 

70
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:12,970
that's a staggeringly naive perspective 
because there's many,

71
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,480
there's many problems in life that money
just cannot solve and there's a fair 

72
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,030
number of them and that it actually 
makes worse.

73
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,480
So anyways,
having said all that,

74
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,780
you could also still make the case.
I used to work for a Socialist Party in 

75
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,980
Canada when I was a kid about six 
[inaudible] time.

76
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:34,981
I was 14 till the time I was about 17 
before I figured out what was wrong,

77
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,010
not so much with socialism per se,
but with ideology per se,

78
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,190
and I actually admired the socialist 
leaders that I had the fortune to be 

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,200
introduced to because at that point they
were very much a voice for the working 

80
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:50,680
class.

81
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,540
A lot of union leaders and people like 
that,

82
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,760
you know,
so they're classic Democratic Socialists

83
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:59,761
on the Labor end of the distribution and
it's absolutely necessary for labor and 

84
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:00,250
the working class to have a political 
voice.

85
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,680
Something the Democrats might keep in 
mind.

86
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,020
So when maybe they wouldn't lose their 
elections quite so frequently now,

87
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:08,680
I really think it's appalling,
you know,

88
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:11,890
because it's necessary for the working 
class to have a political voice.

89
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,280
So.
And to have that transformed into 

90
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,280
identity politics is a real catastrophe.
Anyways.

91
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,200
I think that the people that I met,
many of them were genuinely concerned 

92
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,730
with the problems of the working class 
and you know,

93
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:29,731
more power to them.
And so I think there are people on the 

94
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:32,281
left who,
who genuinely are trying to make a 

95
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:35,521
difference for people who could use a,
a fair shot at opportunity in life.

96
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,720
But at the same time I noticed that a 
tremendous number of the,

97
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,890
of especially the lower and worker,
a party worker per protester types were 

98
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,130
more peevish and resentful than 
goodhearted and kind.

99
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:54,131
And it was about that time that I came 
across George Orwell's famous critique 

100
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:58,471
of left wing thinking and in the UK in a
book called road to Wigan Pier,

101
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:02,210
where he basically made the claim that 
the socialists that he knew,

102
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:05,180
especially the middleclass ones,
didn't give a damn about the poor.

103
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:07,460
They just hated the rich.
And that's,

104
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,490
I mean,
that is something we're thinking about 

105
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,441
for a very long period of time because 
hatred actually turns out to be a very 

106
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,290
powerful motivation,
you know,

107
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,070
and if you think about the sorts of 
things that happened in the Soviet Union

108
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:21,980
and all these places that were supposed 
to be workers paradises,

109
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,280
if you look at the outcome and you had 
to infer whether it was goodness of 

110
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,511
heart and kind heartedness and care for 
the working man that produced the 

111
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:33,260
genocides or outright bitter,
resentful,

112
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,610
resentment,
and hatred,

113
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,730
it's a lot easier to draw a causal path 
from the negative emotion to the 

114
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,721
outcome.
Then from the positive kind hearted 

115
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:46,271
benevolence to that,
you just don't get gulags out of 

116
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,630
benevolence.
That's just not how it works.

117
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,570
So I think the bloody historical 
evidence is clear.

118
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Um,
although I have read the most 

119
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:55,960
convoluted,
pathological,

120
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,970
pathetic,
twisted rationalizations of what 

121
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,571
happens,
stay installing this Russia that you 

122
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:06,701
could possibly manufacture.
It's as if on a stack of corpses that 

123
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:12,131
would reach halfway to the moon isn't 
enough evidence for the pathology of a 

124
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:16,031
certain form of belief.
So some people can't be convinced by 

125
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:16,670
anyone's death,
but their own,

126
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:17,450
I suppose.
