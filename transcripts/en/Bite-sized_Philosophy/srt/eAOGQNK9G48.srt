1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,260
We certainly choose each other for self 
awareness and consciousness and 

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,710
intelligence,
and I don't know if you're,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,180
if you're choosing a mate,
there's an arms race in human beings.

4
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:17,181
We're choosing intelligent mates.
Especially that's especially the case 

5
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:17,940
for women in relationship to men.
So,

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,420
um,
so that,

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,170
the idea that that's a choice.
Well,

8
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:25,380
that's partly why it's even that makes 
himself conscious in the garden of Eden,

9
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:26,760
right?
She offers them the apple.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,910
She's the one that makes him self 
conscious and I think that's actually 

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,911
accurate because the evidence from the 
evolutionary biologists is that human 

12
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:38,820
sexual female sexual selection was what 
are the driving factors that 

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,920
differentiated us from chimpanzees.
It's a major factor.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,920
Chimpanzee females are not selective 
maters.

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,350
They go into estrus,
they'll mate with anything.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,000
What happens is the dominant males 
chased the subordinate males away and so

17
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:56,001
they end up leaving more offspring,
but it's not a consequence of selection 

18
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:56,001
on the part of the females in human 
beings.

19
00:00:56,001 --> 00:01:00,770
It's completely different.
Concealed ovulation and intense 

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,821
selection pressure from women on men.
You have twice as many female ancestors 

21
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:08,451
as you have male ancestors and people 
could never have have a hard time 

22
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:10,680
working that out arithmetically,
but it's not that problematic.

23
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:13,800
You just think on average,
every woman had one child,

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,010
half of men had none,
and the other half had to.

25
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,850
And that's approximately correct if you 
average across the entire history of 

26
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,460
human sexuality.
So human males in particular are subject

27
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,340
to a vicious selection,
pressure on the part of females,

28
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:34,341
and I also think that's partly why 
nature is represented symbolically as 

29
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:38,040
female among human beings,
because after all,

30
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:43,041
nature is what selects.
There's no better definition of the 

31
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:43,860
nature then that which selects.
