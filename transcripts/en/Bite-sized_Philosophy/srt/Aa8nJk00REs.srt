1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,770
One of the things psychologists have 
done for the last 20 years,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,550
especially the social psychologist,
is pushed this idea of self esteem.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,950
You should feel good about yourself and 
I think,

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,330
why would you tell someone 20 that?
It's like,

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,810
you should feel good about who you are.
It's like,

6
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:14,500
no,
you shouldn't.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,630
Why should you feel good about who you 
are?

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,150
It's like you should feel good about who
you could be.

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,550
That's way better because you got 60 
years to turn into who you could wait a 

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,550
minute.

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,250
Are you what your accomplishments are or
you descend dividual going through this 

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,931
journey.
I mean I don't think there's anything 

13
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:34,671
wrong with feeling good about who you 
are as long as it's tempered by an 

14
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:38,391
understanding of potential and what you 
have accomplished versus what you can 

15
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:39,760
accomplish,
but having confidence big,

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,990
hard.
It is.

17
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,860
It is,
and I'm not saying that people shouldn't

18
00:00:42,861 --> 00:00:45,950
have confidence,
but like often you take young people say

19
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:50,951
there are 16 to 22 and they're not 
really feeling that good about who they 

20
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:54,221
are because their life is chaotic and in
disorder and they don't know where 

21
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:54,650
they're going and they don't know which 
way is up a call,

22
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:56,530
so that could be bad parenting card.
Yes,

23
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,870
a lot of abuse going on and I think 
that's one of the reasons why that 

24
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,081
resonates with people.
This idea of be happy for you about who 

25
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:06,200
you are,
feel good about who you are,

26
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,470
but.

27
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,670
But the thing is it has to be stated 
with precision.

28
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:10,600
It's like,
yes,

29
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,660
it's like you should.
You should treat yourself as if you're 

30
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,750
valuable,
especially in potential,

31
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,440
but you should concentrate on who you 
should become,

32
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,450
especially if you're young.
And so let's say you're miserable and 

33
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:24,700
nihilistic and chaotic and depressed and
all of that now,

34
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:26,050
and you have your reasons,
you know,

35
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,360
terrible parenting abuse,
all of those things.

36
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:29,380
It's like,
well,

37
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,510
you should feel good about yourself.
It's like,

38
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:31,900
no,
no,

39
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:36,901
it's not.
It's not the right message is that it's 

40
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:40,921
more like you should understand how much
potential there is within you to set 

41
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:45,331
that straight and then you should do 
everything you can to manifest that in 

42
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:47,620
the world and it will set it straight 
and that's better than self esteem.

43
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:49,480
It's like you're.
You're in a crooked,

44
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:50,740
horrible position.
Okay,

45
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:55,741
fine.
There's a lot of suffering and pain 

46
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:55,741
associated with that.

47
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,200
Yeah,
you can't just feel good about that 

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,200
because it's not good,
but you can do something about it.

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,970
You can genuinely do something about it.
And I think all the evidence suggests 

50
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,030
that that's the case.
Yes.

51
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,750
So I'm telling,
telling young people,

52
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:07,390
look,
there's no matter how bad your situation

53
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:09,310
is,
I'm not going to pretend it's okay.

54
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,170
It's not okay.
It's tragic.

55
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,950
Tainted with malevolence,
and some people really get hurt by 

56
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,050
malevolent people like you know,
terribly hurt.

57
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:19,240
Sometimes they never recover.
It's really awful,

58
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:25,050
but there's more to you than you think.
And if you stand up and face it with a 

59
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,300
positive,
with a,

60
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,450
with a noble vision,
with discipline and intent,

61
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,370
you can go far farther to overcoming it.
Then you can imagine,

62
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,790
and that's the principal upon which you 
should predicate your behavior and I 

63
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,051
think that one of the things that's 
really nice about being a clinical 

64
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:43,420
psychologist is that this isn't just 
guesswork.

65
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,480
Like one of the things we know,
two things in clinical psychology,

66
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:51,481
one is truthful conversations redeemed 
people because if you come to a clinical

67
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:56,890
psychologist who's worth his salt,
you'll have a truthful conversation.

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,990
The conversation is,
well,

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,710
what's wrong with my life and here's 
what caused it,

70
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,740
you know,
maybe it takes a year to have that 

71
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,211
conversation and both of the 
participants are doing everything they 

72
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:11,050
can to lay it out properly.
Here's how it might be fixed,

73
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:13,600
here's what a beneficial future might 
look like.

74
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,990
And so it's a completely honest 
conversation if it's working well and 

75
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,381
all that's happening in the conversation
is that the two people involved are 

76
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:23,380
trying to make things better.
That's the goal.

77
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,500
Let's see if we can have a conversation 
that will make things better.

78
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,150
Okay?
So we know that works.

79
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:30,940
It does make things better.
And then another thing we know is that,

80
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,740
well,
let's say there's a bunch of things that

81
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:37,741
you're afraid of that are in your way,
so you have some vision about who you 

82
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:37,741
want to be.

83
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:38,410
Maybe you have to,
you know,

84
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:40,090
you want to be successful in your 
career,

85
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,010
so you have to learn to talk in front of
a group.

86
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,180
It's like,
okay,

87
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:48,181
well you're afraid of that,
so no wonder you don't want to be 

88
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:48,181
humiliated.
So okay,

89
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:48,880
so what do we do about that?
Well,

90
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:53,881
maybe we first get you to speak in front
of one person and then three people you 

91
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:54,580
know for five minutes and then for 10 
minutes,

92
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:57,880
like graduated exposure to what you're 
afraid of,

93
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,240
voluntary graduated exposure to what 
you're afraid of is curative.

94
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,520
And that's true.
It works.

95
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,400
The documentation is it.
It's how people learn.

96
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:08,740
So,
so to,

97
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,800
to,
to tell people that if you confront the 

98
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,231
world forthrightly,
if you speak the truth and you expose 

99
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:17,480
yourself courageously to those things 
that you're afraid of,

100
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:22,710
that your life will improve.
And so will the life of people around 

101
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,351
you like as far as I'm concerned,
that's as close to undeniable fact as 

102
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:28,780
we've as we've got.
And it also dovetails nicely with the 

103
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:28,780
underlying archetypal stories,
that heroic stories.

104
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,710
It's like,
go out there,

105
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,740
find the dragon confronted.
It's a dragon.

106
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,240
It might eat you.
It's dangerous,

107
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,200
but it's worse to cower at home and wait
for it to come and devour you.

108
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,690
Go out there confronted,
get the gold,

109
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,760
share it with the community.
It's like,

110
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,740
yeah,
it's the oldest story of mankind.
