1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,280
Known territory or what's exploring 
unknown territory or what's not 

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,541
explored,
the Trans transformation or the 

3
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,080
dissolution of one into the other,
and then the reconstitution of that.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,850
That's one of the election does,
right?

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,260
It's like,
okay,

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,560
we have our leader who's the person at 
the top of the dominance hierarchy and 

7
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:22,960
defines the nature of this particular 
structure.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,990
There's an election.
It's regulated chaos.

9
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:29,200
No one knows what's going to happen.
It's the death of the old king.

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,510
Bang.
We go into a chaotic state.

11
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:36,511
Everyone argues for awhile and then out 
of that argument they produce a 

12
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:38,110
consensus and Poof,
we're in a new state,

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,210
right?
That's the Meta story,

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,350
right?
Order,

15
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:44,170
chaos order,
but it's partial order,

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,180
chaos,
reconstituted,

17
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:51,181
and revivified order.
That's the thing is that this order is 

18
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:54,721
better than that order,
so there's progress and that's partly 

19
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,320
why I think the idea of moral relativism
is wrong.

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,180
There's progress in moral order and it 
was defined property by piaget.

21
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,710
The new moral order does everything.
The other moral,

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,850
the old moral order did and some 
additional things.

23
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,520
That's what constitutes progress.
Now,

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,760
here's a.
here's a strange idea and we'll talk 

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,430
about this more as we progress through 
the class.

26
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,350
What's the ultimate in order?

27
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,540
Well,
it's not there,

28
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:25,541
so obviously because it can collapse and
it's not this because it can collapse 

29
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,440
and so then you think,
well,

30
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:30,720
there's no ultimate order even though 
there's progression,

31
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,720
but then you have to move it up one 
level of abstraction.

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,240
What's the ultimate order doing this 
willingness to do that?

33
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,420
That's the ultimate order,
right?

34
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:47,421
It's order at a different level of 
analysis and you can see that's what's 

35
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:50,010
represented in that idea.
That's what that idea means.

36
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,180
That's the Phoenix,
right?

37
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:56,181
The Phoenix is something that lives ages
and then allows itself to be consumed by

38
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,730
fire and then reemerge us and they 
pulled.

39
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:04,410
Phoenix gets old and Burns and the new 
phoenix reemergence,

40
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:09,411
and so the real phoenix is the thing 
that's constant across those 

41
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:11,190
transformations.
That's the union self.

42
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,150
That's what he meant.
The self is the element of the psyche 

43
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,890
that remains intact across 
transformations.

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,230
It's a bloody amazing idea.
That's for sure,

46
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,890
and you could think about that.
That's why you haven't claimed,

47
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:33,891
for example,
in ion primarily that Christ was a 

48
00:02:33,891 --> 00:02:35,880
symbol of the self that was his

49
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,560
consequence of decades of meditation on 
the structure of Christianity because 

50
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,350
it's the dying and resurrecting part of 
the psyche that remains constant across 

51
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,371
the the transformation.
So the ultimate order isn't to identify 

52
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:58,041
with this.
That's your current state of being and 

53
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,160
it isn't tied into fight with that 
because,

54
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,170
well you can't by definition and it 
isn't even to identify with that.

55
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,230
It's to let these things go as they need
to go.

56
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,290
That's a sacrifice and to allow this 
continual process of transformation to 

57
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,540
occur and part of that is the admission 
that you're wrong.

58
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,780
And so partly what you're doing is at 
micro levels and macro levels where are 

59
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:27,151
you not what you could be and when you 
realize that it'll take you apart a 

60
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:31,681
little bit and burn you down to your 
core a little bit and then allow you to 

61
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,240
regenerate.
And if you do that continually,

62
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,600
the everything that you don't need burns
away.

63
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,880
Right?
And that's what this means.

64
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,160
You remember in Harry Potter,
you may remember that Harry goes down,

65
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,520
so in the second volume and in the 
second movie,

66
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:57,210
Harry's at Harvard,
so it's the school where you learn how 

67
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:57,210
to be magic because that's what you 
really are,

68
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,290
and there's something that threatens the
school.

69
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,150
Well,
part of what threatens the school.

70
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,650
Evil,
right?

71
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:03,970
Voldemort.
That's one thing,

72
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,240
but at the same time,
it's also the snake that lurks 

73
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,581
underneath.
It's the basilisk that that threatens 

74
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:12,610
the school,
and so the Basilisk is the dragon,

75
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:17,611
and when the Basler looks at you,
then you're paralyzed because you're a 

76
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:21,331
prey animal.
And if a Predator captures you in its 

77
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:21,430
gaze,
you freeze.

78
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:26,431
And the reason you freeze is because 
your body reacts to the Predator as 

79
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:31,720
something that should turn you to stone 
certain about that.

80
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,410
So what do you do about the bass list?
Well,

81
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:42,411
one thing you do is you run and hide,
but the other thing you do is go 

82
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:44,340
confronted and insulator.
And that's what Harry Potter does now.

83
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,550
And what's interesting about him is he's
also touched by evil,

84
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,580
right?
And that means that he's an embodiment 

85
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,191
of what you would regard as someone 
who's integrated the shadow and without 

86
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:56,310
that capacity,
isn't able to communicate,

87
00:04:56,311 --> 00:05:01,311
say with snakes.
And that's not so good because since 

88
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,071
there are snakes,
it's not such a bad idea to know how to 

89
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,520
communicate with them and he goes down 
into the underground,

90
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:10,521
right into the chaotic domain that's 
underneath the school in order to find 

91
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:10,521
the snake.
And it's layer.

92
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:11,550
Now,
if I remember correctly,

93
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,551
you can you tell me if I'm wrong,
it doesn't need go down through a 

94
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:16,620
bathroom,
through a toilet.

95
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,490
Right?

96
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,520
Well,
so that's an indication of the union 

97
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,520
dictum that where are you,
what you most,

98
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,430
what you need most is to be found where 
you least want to look.

99
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,950
I had a client once who actually had a 
dream like that.

100
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,120
He dreamt that he had to go into the 
underground world through an outhouse.

101
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,830
Right?
Was very,

102
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:39,831
very interesting.
And it was an elaboration of precisely 

103
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:43,041
this theme.
It's what you've thrown away as of 

104
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,711
little value to you and maybe what you 
hate and hold in contempt and fear is 

105
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:50,421
exactly what you have to face if you 
want to go down to the place where the 

106
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:51,690
transformations occur.
So what happens in Harry Potter,

107
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,990
while this Bass licks his wandering 
around paralyzing everyone who isn't 

108
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,870
able to communicate with snakes and he 
doesn't fight the basslink precisely.

109
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,360
It goes down into its layers,
the underground world,

110
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,600
and that what,
what down there is that snake has got a 

111
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:07,880
Vra,
right?

112
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,710
His girlfriend,
that's her name,

113
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,220
right?
It's a,

114
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,310
it's a,
it's a variant of Virginia that's a 

115
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:15,430
variant of virgin.
And the snake always has a virgin.

116
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,490
That's one of its characteristics,
right?

117
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,120
Like gold.
He goes down there to rescue her.

118
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,080
What happens to him?
He gets bit and he's going to die.

119
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,650
So what happens?
The Phoenix comes along and cries tears 

120
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,730
into his wounds and charism.
And that's

121
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,830
so the idea is that what saves you in 
the encounter with the snake is your 

122
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,490
capacity to let things go and die and 
come back to life.

123
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,330
Right?

124
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,620
It's so interesting a that that story's 
told in that way,

125
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:53,320
in that series of volumes because the,
the,

126
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,040
the,
the,

127
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:59,130
the,
the plot structure is perfect in a 

128
00:06:59,130 --> 00:06:59,710
mythological sense.
It's exactly right.

129
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,850
And the Phoenix APP actually happens to 
be the pat of the main wizard,

130
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,040
which is also perfect.
It's exactly right.

131
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,890
So you know,
what's his name?

132
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:08,560
The WHO,
who?

133
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,790
Dumbledore.
Yeah.

134
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,800
He's basically,
for all intents and purposes,

135
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:14,320
God the father and his pat,
his,

136
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,710
his,
his close ally is the thing that can die

137
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:22,711
and that transforms well.
You can see the echoes of Christian 

138
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:24,340
thought in that,
but that isn't exactly right.

139
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:29,230
It's the Christian thought and the 
mythological substructure upon which the

140
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:34,231
Harry Potter volume is based,
are drawing from the same underlying 

141
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:37,591
pool of ideas and symbols and they're 
universally accessible and you can tell 

142
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:43,051
that because if they weren't,
that book wouldn't have sold how many 

143
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:43,900
million copies,
how many million copies did it sell,

144
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,560
and the movies.
If it's unbelievably overwhelmingly 

145
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,520
powerful,
she got kids to read 600 page books,

146
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:53,980
like multiple volumes lining up for 
them.

147
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,930
You got to ask yourself why silly 
stories about magical orphans.

148
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,920
It's like,
well,

149
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,470
maybe not.
Maybe people aren't so stupid,

150
