1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,950
So it's really useful to not defend 
yourself to vociferously,

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,420
which is weird because you'd think,
well,

3
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:08,780
you have the right to defend yourself,
like no all,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,230
no holds barred.
It's like,

5
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,760
no,
it actually doesn't work that way.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,590
You have to defend yourself with minimal
necessary force.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,330
And I think I managed that in the 
channel for interview for thank God,

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,470
but I mean believe me,
people have been talking to me about 

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,590
that nonstop for 15 months and I'm 
listening

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,520
and it wouldn't work as well if he 
hadn't done that right.

11
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:29,950
If you just show laughter,
right?

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,980
The idea,
if he'd just gotten right at her and 

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,661
said,
what you are saying is so stupid for 

14
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:36,661
these five reasons,
it would,

15
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:40,250
it would have been bad.
I think that's actually the fact that 

16
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:40,250
you sat there and he just said,
no,

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,710
you're asking good questions and you 
know,

18
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:46,711
the fact that you're asking good 
questions demonstrates the validity of 

19
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:46,780
your entire viewpoint that that was much
more effective.

20
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,640
Right.
Well,

21
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,400
and that's one of the things I've been 
meditating on for the last years.

22
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:52,900
There's a line in the new testament 
says,

23
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:53,950
resist not evil.

24
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,470
Thank you.
Okay.

25
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,580
What the hell are you supposed to do?
It's like because it's really a 

26
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,390
difficult thing to figure out.
Do you really mean that you don't resist

27
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,560
evil?
Well,

28
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,270
there's a couple of problems is if you 
punch back then you have a fight.

29
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,170
Well,
but you can't just not defend yourself 

30
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,681
like weekly.
You can't be weak and not defend 

31
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:20,961
yourself,
but you can be strong and defend 

32
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:22,470
yourself minimally.
And that's a real art.

33
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:24,960
Like that's,
that's the essence of sophistication.

34
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:27,060
I would say.
Like I'm not,

35
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,040
you know,
I come from kind of a rough place.

36
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,380
I'm coming from northern Alberta.
I come from the frontier,

37
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:36,381
you know,
my town was scraped out of the bloody 

38
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:36,381
prairie 50 years before people moved 
before,

39
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:38,220
before I lived there.
And so,

40
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,820
uh,
it's,

41
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,990
it's been an,
it's been a continual challenge to just 

42
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:49,400
my sophistication to the level of 
challenge and I've,

43
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,730
I'm trying to do that.

44
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,960
Do you think that.
I don't always manage it.

45
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,310
Yeah.
So to that point,

46
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:59,311
do you think that we sometimes actually 
at a deep level use identity politics 

47
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:01,750
against ourselves in,
in this regard?

48
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:03,760
So you're sitting across from Kathy,
she's female.

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,010
Yeah.
At some level.

50
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:08,950
Do you think you may be moderated it 
because of that?

51
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,130
Because had it been a male,
you know,

52
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,170
and you talk about this often,
that we have to act differently towards 

53
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,170
males and females and there's a 
physical,

54
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,130
there's a physical reasons for that and 
biological reasons for that,

55
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,260
but that had she been a male,
say,

56
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,950
say the same exact age from you,
from Alberta and all of that,

57
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,190
that perhaps your response might have 
been a little more forceful even though 

58
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,301
you're.
We're all agreeing your response was 

59
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:33,301
done correctly and evenhandedly.

60
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:34,810
Yeah.
Well I.

61
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,540
It's hard to say,
but probably yes.

62
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,930
That's interesting because you did like,
I can't,

63
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:45,790
I don't think that you can say that you 
fight with a woman the same way that you

64
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,520
fight with a man.
That doesn't mean you can't fight with a

65
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:50,020
woman.
Doesn't mean you shouldn't,

66
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,240
but I don't think the rules are the 
same.

67
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,070
Now,
why are the rules different?

68
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:55,420
Well,
some of the rules are,

69
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,140
there's a physical limit.
It's much more stringent,

70
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,400
right?
I mean,

71
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,700
there's a level of hinting out physical 
threat that you can bring to bear in a 

72
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:11,551
conversation between men that you cannot
bring to bear in a conversation with a 

73
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:12,040
woman.
So,

74
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,220
and the mechanics of that are very,
very subtle and difficult and it's 

75
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,571
especially challenging in an 
intellectual discussion because an 

76
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:25,441
intellectual discussion is a kind of war
and it isn't obvious how men and women 

77
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:26,530
should go to war with one another.
We don't know.

78
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,700
We don't know how to sort that out.
Um,

79
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,410
my sense has been on the panels that 
I've done is that I definitely have to 

80
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,920
pull my punches.
If I'm on a panel with women,

81
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,070
that doesn't mean that I don't.
It doesn't mean that it's any less 

82
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,790
challenging intellectually,
but the strategy and the attitude has to

83
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:50,791
be different.
It's much more likely that you'll be 

84
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:54,631
seen as a bully if you bring the same 
force to bear on a female opponent as 

85
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,260
you would on a male opponent.
