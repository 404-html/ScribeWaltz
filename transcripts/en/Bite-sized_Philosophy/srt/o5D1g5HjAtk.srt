1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,290
See,
in the Soviet Union when soldier knits 

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:06,420
and wrote about the Soviet Union and its
pathologies,

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,160
it,
it sort of peaked in terms of it's 

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,481
pathological authoritarianism when it 
became illegal to complain that your 

5
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:19,791
life wasn't going well and you just 
think about how horrible that is say 

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:20,790
because,
because you know,

7
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,470
lots of times your life isn't going 
well.

8
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:27,471
I mean,
and I don't mean this in some casual 

9
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:27,471
way.
I mean maybe,

10
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:28,130
I don't know.
Maybe you have diabetes in your year and

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,140
Oh,
maybe you're gonna lose your feet or 

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:33,140
something.
It's really not.

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,650
It's nothing trivial that's going on 
here.

14
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:38,850
Something is not good or maybe it's 
economic or maybe you're unemployed or,

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,270
and,
but you see the idea and the Soviet 

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:44,270
Union was,
well,

17
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,370
we already have all the answers.
Everything is perfect already.

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,250
That's what totalitarians think.
Well,

19
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:54,420
if everything's perfect and you're 
suffering,

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,110
then well,
maybe there's something wrong with you 

21
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,420
because everything is perfect after all.

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,420
And if you're suffering,
then what are you gonna come out and 

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:05,420
say,
well,

24
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:05,420
I'm suffering.
It's like,

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,540
well then your evidence that things 
aren't perfect,

26
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:11,541
right?
You're like a widow or an orphan in an 

27
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,480
old testament story,
you know when the Kings got too high and

28
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:17,481
mighty,
then they wouldn't pay enough attention 

29
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:17,481
to the widows and the orphans and then 
the profit would come along and say,

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,840
you know those widows and orphans a lot 
more important than you think they are,

31
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:23,370
and if you don't pay attention to them 
property,

32
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:28,371
then things are going to fall apart 
around you in a way that you just can't 

33
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:31,851
even imagine and so well then you're 
sort of like your own widow in your own 

34
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:31,860
orphan,
but you don't get to say,

35
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:32,340
Hey,
look,

36
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:37,341
you know things aren't perfect yet 
because I'm actually having still quite 

37
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:37,341
a rough time here.

38
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,360
You don't get to admit to your own 
suffering.

39
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,570
If you can't admit to your own 
suffering,

40
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:47,571
then you certainly see the suffering,
especially the additional suffering.

41
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:53,361
The excess suffering should be treated 
as evidence that you're not doing 

42
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:57,021
something quite right yet.
It should be treated as evidence that 

43
00:01:57,031 --> 00:02:02,031
you're wrong.
There's something important that you're 

44
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:05,271
doing that's wrong.
I understand how harsh that is and I'm 

45
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,871
not saying that everyone who is 
suffering is suffering because they're 

46
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:09,870
doing something in some simple way 
that's wrong.

47
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,170
I was in an elevator once in a hospital.
It was a very terrifying thing and this 

48
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:18,510
person got on who was just in an 
absolute state of shock,

49
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:19,080
you know,
I mean,

50
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,470
it was really not good and I don't 
remember how this happened,

51
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:29,661
but I engaged the person in conversation
and they just said that they had just 

52
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:30,930
been diagnosed with what looked to be 
terminal cancer.

53
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,350
And uh,
what was horrifying about it was that 

54
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,290
what they were doing was going over 
their life in the elevator trying to 

55
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,370
figure out what they had done in order 
to deserve such a fate.

56
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:46,371
You know,
they immediately taken it on themselves 

57
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:46,371
as a moral failing.
And that's not what I'm saying.

58
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:49,080
You can't come up to someone who has 
cancer and say,

59
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:54,081
well,
if you weren't such a bloody idiot 

60
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:54,081
throughout your whole life,
you wouldn't have cancer.

61
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:54,480
And believe me,
that happens a lot more than you think.

62
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,060
And people who have diseases like that 
get blamed for it.

63
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,530
That's not what I'm saying.
It's not like it's,

64
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,350
it's,
it's,

65
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,450
it's a more generalized attitude.
That is that if life isn't yet what it 

66
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,490
should be,
then you have a response.

67
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,530
You have a primary responsibility to do 
something about it and the place to 

68
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,671
start looking is to your own errors and 
to fix them.

69
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,750
And that's.
And that's,

70
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,480
that's,
that's a safe bet,

71
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:24,481
man,
because you're probably doing some 

72
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:25,801
things that you would,
wouldn't have to be doing that if you 

73
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:28,621
fixed would make things better.
So it's time to let go and to sacrifice 

74
00:03:28,621 --> 00:03:30,880
who you are for who you could become.
