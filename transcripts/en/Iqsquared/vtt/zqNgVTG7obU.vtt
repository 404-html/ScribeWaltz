00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.781
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2
00:00:00.781 --> 00:00:02.120
<v Speaker 1>the argument that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.180
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.270
<v Speaker 1>taking on cuttings because last point </v>
<v Speaker 1>about when countries become independent,</v>

5
00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I think this is something that a Russian</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians says,</v>

6
00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Oregon complaining about saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

7
00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:13.844
<v Speaker 1>this is the walls was a bloke mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people hate us and they actually </v>

8
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.493
<v Speaker 1>created more problems in a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Europe because they became </v>

9
00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:24.164
<v Speaker 1>independent and they're trying to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own political games and gaming </v>

10
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.183
<v Speaker 1>internationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that a lot of that will depend </v>

11
00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:36.911
<v Speaker 1>on whether they will actually shale gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>development in the foreseeable future in</v>

12
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.743
<v Speaker 1>those countries that you mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think that Russians really </v>

13
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:45.800
<v Speaker 1>have the capacity to act quite quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I said earlier,</v>

14
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.963
<v Speaker 1>there is a lot of pressure now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm particularly from a company such as </v>

15
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Nova Tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also from the Russian oil,</v>

16
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.730
<v Speaker 1>oil companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular Rosneft to um,</v>

17
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.090
<v Speaker 1>which is moving into gas business very </v>
<v Speaker 1>actively,</v>

18
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.493
<v Speaker 1>very actively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they could potentially displace </v>

19
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Gazprom to a certain degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in Russia and also externally.</v>

20
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.423
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

22
00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:15.914
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's often difficult to make </v>

23
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:21.380
<v Speaker 1>predictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your question is it related to 10 years,</v>

24
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.970
<v Speaker 1>20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years,</v>

25
00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:23.804
<v Speaker 1>40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we look at this aspect to </v>

26
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:28.250
<v Speaker 1>remember about all this forecast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about,</v>

27
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the,</v>

28
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.910
<v Speaker 1>the latest they're talking about 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>35,</v>

29
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>$24.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by looking but you know,</v>

30
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.440
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years ahead,</v>

31
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>look at what we're now in year 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

32
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>20 slash 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has happened in the world.</v>

33
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.573
<v Speaker 1>So I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an important point that the </v>

34
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:55.630
<v Speaker 1>world is changing and a very fast pace </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that a lot of this,</v>

35
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a forecast and predictions are just,</v>

36
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a guide for us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>base our decisions.</v>
