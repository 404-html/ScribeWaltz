1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
<v Speaker 1>So we really got to gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.033
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a tremendous change over </v>

3
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:05.574
<v Speaker 1>the last century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be the biggest social change in </v>

4
00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years of history for </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 1>You had so many different revolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>

6
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>social and economic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many different things changed.</v>

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 1>But this basic patriarchal structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>most human societies,</v>

8
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>at least the more the bigger human </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies didn't change.</v>

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.673
<v Speaker 1>And over the last hundred years you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really fundamental change in the </v>

10
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:37.194
<v Speaker 1>status of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the relation in gender relations </v>

11
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:40.494
<v Speaker 1>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still very far from being a </v>

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>completely ugly and society and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionable whether it,</v>

13
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 1>it will be possible ever to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete legal in society.</v>

14
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that,</v>

16
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing has been done or accomplished in</v>

17
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 1>the last few decades looking to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>And it's also links to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

19
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.170
<v Speaker 1>to the other question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure they'll still be genders in</v>

20
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>50 or a hundred or a hundred and 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

21
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.493
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this new ability to re engineered </v>

22
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.723
<v Speaker 1>to create bodies and brains and minds as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic products of the 21st century </v>

23
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:24.114
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most fundamental structures of the </v>

24
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>human body and mind them themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>might change.</v>

25
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.003
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not so sure that 100 years from </v>
<v Speaker 1>now people will have a clear agenda of </v>

26
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.370
<v Speaker 1>just one gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

27
00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>just to give an example of what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to happen.</v>

28
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in mutual realities,</v>

29
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:50.034
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy for a person to adopt a </v>

30
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 1>different gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a to change genders,</v>

31
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>to construct all kinds of alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>genders.</v>

32
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.683
<v Speaker 1>And you have today like kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh boys will play the role as girls and </v>

33
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:05.780
<v Speaker 1>vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In,</v>

34
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 1>as other towns in virtual world today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still very primitive.</v>

35
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>You sit in front of the computer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a two dimensional reality.</v>

36
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>But in 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years,</v>

37
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.743
<v Speaker 1>a more and more off life might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>transferred into a three dimensional </v>

38
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.723
<v Speaker 1>virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which provides people with far more </v>

39
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:31.521
<v Speaker 1>excitement and far more interest than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the drab life in the outside world.</v>

40
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>In an economy where they are no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed.</v>

41
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.363
<v Speaker 1>And the political system which we in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which they have no power and in such a </v>

42
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:40.300
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

43
00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:45.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't just take it for granted that</v>

44
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.863
<v Speaker 1>the gender structure familiar to us </v>
<v Speaker 1>today and for thousands of years in the </v>

45
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>past will still be relevant in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 50 or 100 years.</v>
