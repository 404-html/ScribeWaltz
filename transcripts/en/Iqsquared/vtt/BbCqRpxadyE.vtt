00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.113
<v Speaker 1>It is about cultural relativism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what this discussion is </v>

2
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>essentially about Western values as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand them,</v>

3
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>not just practiced in the west practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the large number of places,</v>

4
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:30.864
<v Speaker 1>but usually called Western values and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shared common universal values coming </v>

5
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>from different traditions and then we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can share</v>

6
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and other religions and the</v>

7
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.554
<v Speaker 1>Jewish tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a point which is quite </v>

8
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>important and it has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural relativism.</v>

9
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 2>There are no jokes in Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As famously said,</v>

10
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 2>the West is able to look at his foibles </v>
<v Speaker 2>and laugh to make fun of his fundamental</v>

11
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:13.554
<v Speaker 2>principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is no equivalent as yet of </v>

12
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 2>monty python's life of Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we look forward to the life of Mo</v>

13
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.883
<v Speaker 1>when one search this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this notion is ludicrous notion of </v>

14
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:25.514
<v Speaker 1>racial or cultural or value superiority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is really denying all of the cross </v>

15
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.840
<v Speaker 1>cultural wealth of our human legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would,</v>

16
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.823
<v Speaker 1>we would throw out half of the poetry of</v>
<v Speaker 1>gutter who was inspired by the Persian </v>

17
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.040
<v Speaker 1>poet Hafez and then we've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would,</v>

18
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.930
<v Speaker 1>not that anyone here would read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob,</v>

19
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.783
<v Speaker 1>but we it ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was inspired by Gerta and wrote </v>

20
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:49.934
<v Speaker 1>poems and honor of gotTa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a cross cultural that what God </v>

21
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.793
<v Speaker 1>himself called the East West Duwan where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could all sit together and exchange </v>

22
00:01:57.201 --> 00:01:59.540
<v Speaker 1>our cultures and exchange our values and</v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange your ideas.</v>

23
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.553
<v Speaker 1>If you go into that table to sit down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner with another man and or another </v>

24
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:06.170
<v Speaker 1>woman and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am superior.</v>

25
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a dialogue.</v>
