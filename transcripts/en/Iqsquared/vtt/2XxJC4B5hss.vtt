1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>But roughly speaking ever since smog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's natural for every two pounds we pay</v>

2
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:06.084
<v Speaker 1>and we get one pound back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one pound we get back is under </v>

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.893
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think we're going to be stronger </v>

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>because our economy is strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the vote leave,</v>

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I think going to be safer because we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got greater control of our borders.</v>

6
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:18.834
<v Speaker 1>Who voted leave and I think we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be better off and we're going to be </v>

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.313
<v Speaker 1>better off because the European Union </v>
<v Speaker 1>was created in a time when big trading </v>

8
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>blox existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't exist anymore.</v>

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>What we've got now is global trading of </v>
<v Speaker 1>goods,</v>

10
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.383
<v Speaker 1>global trading of services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we also have global movement of </v>

11
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:37.914
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of these things the ear is capable </v>

12
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>of dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has outgrown its time.</v>

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I wish the euro countries well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need deeper integration.</v>

14
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.413
<v Speaker 1>They need it because I don't want how </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations of young people to be on a </v>

15
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>heap of unemployment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish them well.</v>

16
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I think we're better off to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave.</v>

17
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>If we are strong and they're strong than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the continent of Europe is strong.</v>

18
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>If we collectively week that will serve </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one.</v>

19
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>So take control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vote leave.</v>

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.920
