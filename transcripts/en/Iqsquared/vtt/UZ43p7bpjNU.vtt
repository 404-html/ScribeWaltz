00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend in Albany and she called </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.500
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Moses was up here yesterday and I</v>

3
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:08.334
<v Speaker 1>think you should come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I remember driving up to Albany and </v>

4
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:12.294
<v Speaker 1>walking into the press gallery of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>assembly just as they approved the </v>

5
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:20.070
<v Speaker 1>bridge by a vote of something like 183 </v>
<v Speaker 1>to four,</v>

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.503
<v Speaker 1>and I remember thinking in that moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I've been writing has sorta </v>

7
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>been baloney because whether you say it </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not in an article,</v>

8
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>everything I was doing was based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling that ended democracy.</v>

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Political power comes from the ballot </v>
<v Speaker 1>box from being elected from the people.</v>

10
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.993
<v Speaker 1>Yet here was a man who was never elected</v>
<v Speaker 1>to anything and enough power to turn in </v>

11
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.114
<v Speaker 1>an entire state government around in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single day and I had no idea and </v>

12
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>actually neither did anybody else where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he got this power from.</v>

13
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.593
<v Speaker 1>And it was then that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that if I really wanted to </v>

14
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>write about politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truthfully I have to find out because no</v>

15
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>one knew where he got his power and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>we had been using it for so long.</v>
