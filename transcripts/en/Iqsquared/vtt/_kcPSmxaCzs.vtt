00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.800
<v Speaker 1>How many of you believe that nature has </v>
<v Speaker 1>a balance,</v>

2
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.090
<v Speaker 1>that nature is this fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal,</v>

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.623
<v Speaker 1>even beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated tapestry of interrelated </v>

4
00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:15.904
<v Speaker 1>things that all lien one against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and make it all perfect and </v>

5
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:21.520
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you do,</v>

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.330
<v Speaker 1>and it's what George Bailey's is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're entirely wrong.</v>

7
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Nature works on Cataclysm and accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all,</v>

8
00:00:29.471 --> 00:00:32.980
<v Speaker 1>we are all competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were born competitive.</v>

9
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>We grew up competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were evolved from competition.</v>

10
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.210
<v Speaker 1>There is no right way for the world to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

11
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.950
<v Speaker 1>There was no moment where George's world</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just keep it there,</v>

12
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>don't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that</v>

13
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.013
<v Speaker 1>there was no marvelous time when the up </v>
<v Speaker 1>plans with just that nice little bit of </v>

14
00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:59.521
<v Speaker 1>woodiness and not too many festivals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't exist.</v>

15
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 1>We all get on because something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>fails.</v>

16
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>The natural role in existence is to lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>to extermination.</v>

17
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.343
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to most things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been immensely successful as a </v>

18
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:23.060
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not our fault.</v>

19
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.040
<v Speaker 1>That's our brilliance.</v>

20
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.773
<v Speaker 1>What I mind about George's view of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is that there is nature and then </v>

22
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>there's us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's everything else.</v>

23
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>There's all the glory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's me</v>

24
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>greedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat farting.</v>

25
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:53.331
<v Speaker 1>Slovenly slothful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncaring twat eating things with eyes.</v>

26
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I am as much part of nature as every </v>
<v Speaker 1>other species here in this world.</v>

27
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.893
<v Speaker 1>All of us are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what I mind about this view of the </v>

28
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 1>way the world works is it stopped me </v>
<v Speaker 1>being part of my birthright,</v>

29
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.560
<v Speaker 1>which is part of natural selection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me a fucking zoo keeper,</v>

30
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to be a park ranger in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your park.</v>
