1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.000
<v Speaker 1>In the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.870
<v Speaker 1>if we take census numbers and if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that the homes,</v>

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.733
<v Speaker 1>the households in the US are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a little smaller such as Germany </v>

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.613
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States will have to build 74 </v>

5
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.490
<v Speaker 1>million new homes or the next 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>74 million.</v>

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.420
<v Speaker 1>This is more than the United Kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.463
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Australia put together has today in </v>

8
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>pencil halls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not China,</v>

9
00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:30.074
<v Speaker 1>this is the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now the question is how out of the </v>

10
00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:35.314
<v Speaker 1>city going to grow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody agrees today that low density </v>

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.043
<v Speaker 1>suburbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the characteristic urban net </v>

12
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.863
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States is not convenient for </v>

13
00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:48.320
<v Speaker 1>quality of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our environment,</v>

14
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 1>but also most Americans don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in Manhattan either.</v>

15
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:55.274
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to live in high rises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facing a narrow sidewalk on a street </v>

16
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.893
<v Speaker 1>full of cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is dangerous where people may get </v>

17
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is noisy.</v>

18
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.263
<v Speaker 1>So the question is we need to build 74 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million new homes in the United States </v>

19
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.133
<v Speaker 1>and whatever it is done in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States would have a huge influence in </v>

20
00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:19.250
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world.</v>

21
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 1>How are they see this going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>billed,</v>

22
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.180
<v Speaker 1>so why not think of an American new </v>
<v Speaker 1>American safety with which is dense with</v>

23
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.363
<v Speaker 1>thousands of miles of greenways and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pedestrian only wrote criss crossing in </v>

24
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.193
<v Speaker 1>a city which would be offer density with</v>
<v Speaker 1>offering the same things that people </v>

25
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.543
<v Speaker 1>seek in the suburbs such as green and </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe spaces for children to ride </v>

26
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:48.524
<v Speaker 1>bicycles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I radically different design because </v>

27
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:56.141
<v Speaker 1>clearly we are talking about technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we have in suburbs or downtown?</v>

28
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.583
<v Speaker 1>Neither one of those works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we clearly need to think about </v>

29
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>different urban model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the second question is not only how,</v>

30
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.440
<v Speaker 1>but where are they see this going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the United States.</v>

31
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Clearly you should not be billed beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>the existing suburbs far away beyond the</v>

32
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:18.710
<v Speaker 1>exiting sober.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where is,</v>

33
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 1>where are these 74 million homes to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>built?</v>

34
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.790
<v Speaker 1>I would say the obvious answer would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>to build demolishing,</v>

35
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>demolishing thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of hectors.</v>

36
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll make 16 sobers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which where were located?</v>

37
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.303
<v Speaker 1>Why is the United States so important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this has been an enormous </v>

38
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.330
<v Speaker 1>influence on what is to happen all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and I see it,</v>

39
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Speaker 1>I see these only means to our way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

40
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.650
<v Speaker 1>So designing a CD will reality signing </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways of life,</v>

41
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.820
<v Speaker 2>whatever</v>

42
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>we're to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the next 40 or 50 years in developing</v>

43
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>countries will determine the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainability,</v>

44
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>quality of life and happiness for </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions.</v>

45
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.883
<v Speaker 1>I am absolutely convinced that radically</v>
<v Speaker 1>not designs a very different cities are </v>

46
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are very simple.</v>

47
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:19.204
<v Speaker 1>They are politically very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they could lead us to have cities </v>

48
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:24.334
<v Speaker 1>which are much more sustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people will live much happier </v>

49
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:28.654
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
