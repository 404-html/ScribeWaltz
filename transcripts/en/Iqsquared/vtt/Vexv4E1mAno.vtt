00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.003
<v Speaker 1>The green agenda if pressed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>competently in political terms with the </v>

2
00:00:04.581 --> 00:00:06.770
<v Speaker 1>wrong compelling messages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.210
<v Speaker 1>imposed on people in the wrong ways will</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually delay the green revolution.</v>

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.523
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've just had a perfect example </v>

5
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.410
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people are saying,</v>

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.453
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must be very careful about gas </v>

7
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:18.880
<v Speaker 1>expansion and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>we've done to shale gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America's fine,</v>

9
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:24.620
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't want to see too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouragement here.</v>

10
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.753
<v Speaker 1>What is the net effect of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The net effect is that American code is </v>

11
00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:28.994
<v Speaker 1>pouring into Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're burning more color here in this </v>

12
00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:31.604
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe's code as a whole is increasing </v>

13
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:34.814
<v Speaker 1>the actual Germans or planning new coal </v>
<v Speaker 1>fired stations where s and m c o to </v>

14
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.590
<v Speaker 1>welland forming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling to America to the 20th,</v>

15
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 1>20 year level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lowest level,</v>

16
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.323
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the foreign 14% in the last two </v>

17
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:48.854
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the per capita emissions has fallen </v>

18
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just a recession issue.</v>

19
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.203
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

20
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
<v Speaker 2>because you have chosen a quite a two </v>
<v Speaker 2>year horizon in a time of low us grace.</v>

21
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Can I call you on that?</v>

22
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can call me,</v>

23
00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>but the 57 million extra people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America in the last 20 years,</v>

24
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>and yet the carbon co two emissions up </v>
<v Speaker 1>now 20% down,</v>

25
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.113
<v Speaker 1>they are very loud.</v>
