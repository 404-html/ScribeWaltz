00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Britain has a long history of inventing </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant new technologies,</v>

2
00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:11.300
<v Speaker 1>processes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and designs,</v>

3
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.373
<v Speaker 1>but how do we make sure these </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovations translate into money making </v>

4
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies and industries?</v>

5
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.163
<v Speaker 1>What is needed in today's turbulent </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic climate to turn British </v>

6
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 1>startups into world beaters?</v>

7
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.963
<v Speaker 1>Entrepreneurial Spirit is high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning of 2012 4.8 million </v>

8
00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:37.874
<v Speaker 1>startups were operating in the UK an </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase of over 200,000 firms on the </v>

9
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.740
<v Speaker 1>previous year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Securing funding is a real challenge.</v>

10
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.360
<v Speaker 1>In a recent survey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than six out of 10 small businesses</v>

11
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>said lack of startup capital was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrier they found hardest to overcome.</v>

12
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.243
<v Speaker 1>So what next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the USA there has been a surge in </v>

13
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.473
<v Speaker 1>crowdfunding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The website kickstarter has raised more </v>

14
00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:13.781
<v Speaker 1>than $660 million for 43,000 product </v>
<v Speaker 1>offerings and over 4 million people have</v>

15
00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:16.454
<v Speaker 1>contributed money in the UK exit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>based crowd cube has 37,000 registered </v>

16
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>investors and has raised over 9 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

17
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Venture capital is also important for </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiration.</v>

18
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.850
<v Speaker 1>British policy makers could look to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel,</v>

19
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.713
<v Speaker 1>which attracts more than twice as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>venture capital per capita than any </v>

20
00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:43.171
<v Speaker 1>other country at $170 per person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With this model,</v>

21
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Israel has established a world leading </v>
<v Speaker 1>high tech startup culture,</v>

22
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.400
<v Speaker 1>impressive for a country of just 7 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>

23
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>but while venture capital and crowd </v>
<v Speaker 1>funding are important,</v>

24
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.790
<v Speaker 1>big business has a role to play.</v>
