00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.500
<v Speaker 1>The millions of goods that are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated.</v>

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.740
<v Speaker 1>The millions of children that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting vaccines,</v>

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.843
<v Speaker 1>the thousands of civil society </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations that have been </v>

4
00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:11.324
<v Speaker 1>strengthened in the fight for human </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights and in the fight against </v>

5
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:14.474
<v Speaker 1>corruption should made us proud about </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight because this is what aid is being </v>

6
00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:19.274
<v Speaker 1>used for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the red hots that aid is </v>

7
00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>producing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

8
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.670
<v Speaker 1>the development financing landscape is </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing dramatically.</v>

9
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Countries are racing more domestic </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources through taxation.</v>

10
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Private sector is investing more and new</v>
<v Speaker 1>donors are playing an increasing role.</v>

11
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.890
<v Speaker 1>So in this context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it have a future?</v>

12
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>My answer is yes.</v>

13
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.603
<v Speaker 1>The other question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that future going to be the same as </v>

15
00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 1>in the past?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My answer is equally clear.</v>

16
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.203
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to remain relevant in this </v>

17
00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:01.960
<v Speaker 1>changing landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight has got to become smarter.</v>

18
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.063
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean in practice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it means at least the things it </v>

19
00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:08.170
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

20
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>that is going to be used where it's most</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed in countries,</v>

21
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>areas to people that have less access to</v>
<v Speaker 1>other sources of funding.</v>

22
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.673
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be used to strengthen </v>

23
00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:26.230
<v Speaker 1>countries own capacities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To solve their problems.</v>

24
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.183
<v Speaker 1>So the lessons of the Paris Declaration </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the and agenda for action and of the </v>

25
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.100
<v Speaker 1>somme used country systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are still relevant.</v>

26
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.533
<v Speaker 1>But thirdly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be used smarter to catalyze </v>

27
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 1>other sources of funding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help mobilize private funding,</v>

28
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>to help increase taxation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help use remittances better,</v>

29
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for development.</v>

30
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.493
<v Speaker 1>And I think if we use eight smarter than</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be possible to continue to </v>

31
00:01:59.111 --> 00:01:59.944
<v Speaker 1>convince taxpayers in countries that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling at present that aid is </v>

32
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 1>relevant also in the future.</v>
