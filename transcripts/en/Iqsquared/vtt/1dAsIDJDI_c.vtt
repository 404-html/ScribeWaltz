<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a debate.</v>

3
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 2>It's an occupied spirit that cannot be </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped as the former attorney general,</v>

4
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.160
<v Speaker 2>a prosecutor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the governor of that state,</v>

5
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.320
<v Speaker 2>and not only accept your child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are dead wrong,</v>

6
00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We cannot talk.</v>

7
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Know this is not 1989 anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder whether when they say,</v>

8
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 2>I'll pray for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets that wonderful reply.</v>

9
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll think for you on the unselfish or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing a redundant,</v>

10
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.143
<v Speaker 2>I won't say it's too easy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better late than never here I've said </v>

11
00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:06.974
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people in this world are </v>

12
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:13.610
<v Speaker 2>looking for an alternative approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never dropped the bomb.</v>

13
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:15.620
<v Speaker 2>We never launched a missile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never fired a bullet.</v>

14
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 2>I doubt very much whether they will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuine,</v>

15
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.100
<v Speaker 2>one man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one vote,</v>

16
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.870
<v Speaker 2>but I would be delighted to be proven if</v>
<v Speaker 2>we mess up this one.</v>

17
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.040
<v Speaker 2>There's no other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What done for</v>

18
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.770
<v Speaker 2>the war on terror was the right response</v>
<v Speaker 2>to nine 11 but we need to refinance,</v>

19
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.900
<v Speaker 2>not just have bankers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mintos think the whole of our society,</v>

20
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.320
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hip hop pomp enhanced the society.</v>

21
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 2>We should be calling an end to the war </v>
<v Speaker 2>on drugs.</v>

22
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Barack Obama is ultimately an American </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriot.</v>

23
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 2>The Catholic church is a force for good </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

24
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.763
<v Speaker 2>Are you getting the message?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a reason we hammer home these </v>

25
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.750
<v Speaker 2>use because they matter.</v>
