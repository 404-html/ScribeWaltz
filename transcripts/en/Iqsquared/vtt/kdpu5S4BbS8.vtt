00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.820
<v Speaker 1>How I described the situation is that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposition,</v>

2
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:13.803
<v Speaker 1>but is the regime and both are fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the power and that the red line in </v>

3
00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Syria is the power the chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

4
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>I do not see that the red line is </v>
<v Speaker 1>neither for the opposition,</v>

5
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>nor for the regime is the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference is enormous.</v>

6
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.713
<v Speaker 1>You can the opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're after power rather the country </v>

7
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.450
<v Speaker 1>now it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is what we say in Arabic,</v>

8
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.940
<v Speaker 1>which means a winning or losing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

9
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.650
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I feel is what I.</v>

10
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.820
<v Speaker 1>When I look at the opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel they represent me.</v>

11
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.750
<v Speaker 1>When I look at the aging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely</v>

12
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.780
<v Speaker 2>presenting and that implies a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>equality kind of parity between the two.</v>

13
00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Here are these two forces fighting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

14
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.803
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a kind of parody between </v>

15
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.040
<v Speaker 2>opposition in government in Syria?</v>

16
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.033
<v Speaker 1>I think who is fighting for the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants to put the country first </v>

17
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>rather than the chair rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasping the pallet?</v>

18
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.693
<v Speaker 3>I disagree Turkey with what she said </v>
<v Speaker 3>simply because there is no real </v>

19
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 3>opposition yet that has formed in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>political sense,</v>

20
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.073
<v Speaker 3>and this is very much to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that the notion of an opposition </v>

21
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.663
<v Speaker 3>has totally obliterated from Syrian </v>
<v Speaker 3>polity and Syria and life and Syrian </v>

22
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 3>minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

23
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.863
<v Speaker 3>what we have seen over the past year and</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks is the creation of a groundswell </v>

24
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.730
<v Speaker 3>movement that has taken over the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the country.</v>

25
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.130
<v Speaker 3>So it's no longer in humps or in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Adelaide or in other areas in Syria.</v>

26
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.940
<v Speaker 3>It is everywhere in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this parity,</v>

27
00:02:12.941 --> 00:02:13.774
<v Speaker 3>so called parity simply does not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that the opposition is </v>

28
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:22.881
<v Speaker 3>fighting for a chair I think is quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre to me anyway.</v>

29
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just hear your view of it because </v>

30
00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:31.151
<v Speaker 2>you were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

31
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually betty,</v>

32
00:02:32.681 --> 00:02:35.060
<v Speaker 2>betty simple at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the battle in Syria,</v>

33
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 2>the conflict in Syria at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it boils down to one word,</v>

34
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.740
<v Speaker 2>and that is actually survival,</v>
<v Speaker 2>survival,</v>

35
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 2>survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what people are fighting for.</v>

36
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.520
<v Speaker 2>Rob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this point in time,</v>

37
00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 2>people are fighting to stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

38
00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:48.224
<v Speaker 2>they every tonight nicer indicated no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no political push from within </v>

39
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:55.370
<v Speaker 2>Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fight to stay alive day to day.</v>
