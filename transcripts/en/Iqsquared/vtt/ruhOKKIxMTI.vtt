<v Speaker 1>Welcome to today's hot topic from </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence squared.com who has got it </v>

2
00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:07.820
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does liberal democracy need you to get a</v>

3
00:00:07.821 --> 00:00:08.654
<v Speaker 1>thick skin or does it need a strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>state protecting us from extreme verbal </v>

4
00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:13.034
<v Speaker 1>assault?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are some highlights from Wendy </v>

5
00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:18.080
<v Speaker 1>kaminer confronting Femi [inaudible] as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they thrash it out.</v>

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.350
<v Speaker 1>We start with femi defending curbs on </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate speech,</v>

7
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.103
<v Speaker 2>less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less hate will be bread and so we would </v>

8
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:28.904
<v Speaker 2>have less to fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that hate speech can certainly </v>

9
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 2>be a contributing factor to bigotry and </v>
<v Speaker 2>prejudice.</v>

10
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:38.210
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

11
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.043
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not here defending the merits of </v>

12
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:43.670
<v Speaker 2>hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

13
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.361
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

14
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:47.930
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is always much more dangerous</v>

15
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.960
<v Speaker 2>and I also think that it's morally wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>to criminalize speech that we don't like</v>

16
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.630
<v Speaker 2>because we have some sense that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>long run it's,</v>

17
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to cause decide or harm.</v>

18
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.940
<v Speaker 2>People should be given the right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak yes to the point where it violates</v>

19
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:12.620
<v Speaker 2>the rights of others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People may be given the right to express</v>

20
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:17.440
<v Speaker 2>their concerns about principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not about individual characteristics</v>

21
00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:18.274
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally am grateful and proud to </v>

22
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:23.324
<v Speaker 2>live in a country and to be part of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nation that does not tolerate hate </v>

23
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:27.944
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's anything I would say that </v>

24
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:33.130
<v Speaker 2>perhaps our restrictions and keeps me in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UK.</v>

25
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.183
<v Speaker 2>I've go far enough if I can take this </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to respond quickly to some </v>

26
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:38.710
<v Speaker 2>of the things that family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first,</v>

27
00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:39.544
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really appreciate her forthrightness </v>

28
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.290
<v Speaker 2>in questioning why we need to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech,</v>

29
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 2>because that's not a statement that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>will generally hear from people in the u</v>

30
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:53.360
<v Speaker 2>s to defend hate speech regulation </v>
<v Speaker 2>because here,</v>

31
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

32
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.100
<v Speaker 2>it's not really so acceptable to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in free speech.</v>
