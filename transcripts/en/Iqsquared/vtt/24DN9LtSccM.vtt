00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.600
<v Speaker 1>So what is the great challenge or </v>
<v Speaker 1>question before us?</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I think of it as the wall within each </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of us.</v>

3
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>The war between apathy and action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apathy is very seductive.</v>

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.943
<v Speaker 1>It is wreathed in false facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Facts such as there is no progress in </v>

5
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no progress anywhere.</v>

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.250
<v Speaker 1>The is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.133
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All African leaders are corrupt and all </v>

8
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>aid is wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are holes,</v>

9
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:23.110
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the datasets.</v>

10
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.103
<v Speaker 1>D datasets do not exist to justify them </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet they bounce around unscrutinised </v>

11
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>they need to be challenged because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're wrong.</v>

12
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Against that is the call to action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just mindless action,</v>

13
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:35.424
<v Speaker 1>but evidence based action or factor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some call it and that's a growing </v>

14
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:40.404
<v Speaker 1>movement of informed global citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take action based on the facts to </v>

15
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:45.144
<v Speaker 1>change government policies or make </v>
<v Speaker 1>informed consumer decisions that result </v>

16
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>in building on facts of progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Facts such as we have in fact hearth,</v>

17
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:55.284
<v Speaker 1>extreme poverty.</v>

18
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>There are now 9 million people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>antiretroviral drugs funded by you.</v>

19
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.743
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're saving these lives through </v>

20
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>funding these drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

21
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.303
<v Speaker 1>Malaria deaths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths down because of insecticide </v>

22
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>treated bed nets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

23
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>funded by taxpayer funded eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs,</v>

24
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:12.684
<v Speaker 1>a smart aid programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and above all progress generated by </v>

25
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:16.824
<v Speaker 1>great leadership in Africa by some </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments in a bubble by citizens in </v>

26
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:21.084
<v Speaker 1>these countries and across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing world who are demanding </v>

27
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.083
<v Speaker 1>better results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chance we have now is through the </v>

28
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.553
<v Speaker 1>Millennium Goals renewed to build on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact of progress armed citizens across </v>

29
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:33.414
<v Speaker 1>the world with scorecards to measure </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments and they're holding them </v>

30
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:38.694
<v Speaker 1>accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the great prize we have before </v>

31
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:43.370
<v Speaker 1>us to generate this army of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.363
<v Speaker 1>informed global citizens who will build </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the facts of progress and avoid </v>

33
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>terrible facts that could exist by 2030.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't get this right,</v>

34
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>to which world you want and which set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts do you want to live in by 2030.</v>

35
00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.293
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
