00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.590
<v Speaker 1>The trump supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a resistance to judging trump on his</v>

2
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>merits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of which there are none,</v>

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>comes down in part to this with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>loop,</v>

5
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:17.250
<v Speaker 1>back to that rebellion against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elites.</v>

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that,</v>

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>there has been tremendous scorn for and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun made of trump and in deed deed trump</v>

8
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:30.924
<v Speaker 1>supporters in when you are angry at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment and you see the </v>

9
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:36.504
<v Speaker 1>establishment and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just disagreeing with your </v>

10
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mocking or candidate.</v>

11
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>There is an element of this is they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>mocking me.</v>

12
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.973
<v Speaker 1>They're mocking me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these people at the New York Times </v>

13
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>going on and on about how does this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>

14
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>This horrible person cannot possibly be </v>
<v Speaker 1>president too.</v>

15
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Speaker 1>They're saying that I am so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Speaker 1>because I support him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.983
<v Speaker 1>they're looking down on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all these fancy college educated </v>

18
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>people and I'm the one doing the hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

19
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.673
<v Speaker 1>And they're looking down at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was almost every time you </v>

21
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:12.654
<v Speaker 1>went out to make fun of trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you increased to support because people </v>

22
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>were feeling scorned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

23
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:19.141
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

24
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>when people feel that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>outsiders,</v>

25
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:22.704
<v Speaker 1>you cannot convince them by mocking them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't convince them by mocking </v>

26
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>their position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the he,</v>

27
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.963
<v Speaker 1>we had to either wait for what seems I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope to have happen for the guy's head </v>

28
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>explode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>or we had to take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>some sort of other approach to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

31
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>to this and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

32
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

33
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:49.010
<v Speaker 1>let's look at it from this angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>

34
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.933
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is a good reason to vote for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Libertarian party or maybe it </v>

35
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scorn does not.</v>

36
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people feel scorned to heap,</v>

37
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>scorn upon them isn't going to work.</v>
