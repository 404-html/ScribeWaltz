1
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.953
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel I have a very high heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>burden since I have Jack and con on my </v>

2
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:13.600
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a great pleasure to appear</v>

3
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>with such worthy adversaries if I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can,</v>

4
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I use that term in the age of Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe partners,</v>

5
00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:20.134
<v Speaker 1>I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I very much hope the president changes </v>

6
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.610
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his foreign policy,</v>

7
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>but for now I'm afraid it's a failure.</v>

8
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 2>How can you talk about the unsafe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

9
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 2>If God forbid something had happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>John Mccain,</v>

11
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 2>we'd have President Pailin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

12
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:39.350
<v Speaker 2>we'd all sleep safely and our bands </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it.</v>

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 2>The greatest gift to the animism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Erica was the eight.</v>

14
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fiasco.</v>

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 2>A masterpiece of ineptitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calamity,</v>

16
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:51.204
<v Speaker 2>and arrogance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the administration of George W </v>

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.783
<v Speaker 2>Bush</v>

18
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.180
<v Speaker 3>standing on a stage here when encourages</v>
<v Speaker 3>theatrical performances.</v>

19
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.300
<v Speaker 3>We just got one and I'm the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious.</v>

20
00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:06.091
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

21
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:08.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a military guy.</v>

22
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:09.104
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to deal with facts and less </v>

23
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:11.870
<v Speaker 3>with the metrics.</v>

24
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.753
<v Speaker 4>My feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my belief is that President Obama is </v>

25
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.390
<v Speaker 4>early Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I vote no against a reasonably shun it.</v>

26
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.070
<v Speaker 4>I think that Barack Obama is not a gift </v>
<v Speaker 4>to our enemies,</v>

27
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.190
<v Speaker 4>but is a two hour the and the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>efficient of it,</v>

28
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 4>most efficient for poisons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are the Chinese boy zones.</v>

29
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 4>I think Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>among his many gifts,</v>

30
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.250
<v Speaker 4>has the intellectual and moral force to </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at this new map.</v>

31
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.143
<v Speaker 4>Clearly it is one in which we cannot </v>
<v Speaker 4>isolate strategic problems from legal </v>

32
00:01:58.641 --> 00:01:59.474
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>

33
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 3>I just like to address my former tutor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simon Schama.</v>

34
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.013
<v Speaker 3>I often found the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his tour de force in the tutorial is </v>

35
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Speaker 3>rather than using as I did today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dear my dear former professor,</v>

36
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>failed to address the motion here.</v>

37
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 3>This motion is about Obama's foreign </v>
<v Speaker 3>policy,</v>

38
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 3>not how much we detest George Bush or </v>
<v Speaker 3>share a painter</v>

39
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 2>thing about thinking about student calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was He always had,</v>

40
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was saying,</v>

41
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:26.934
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which actually meant I haven't actually </v>

42
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 2>read the assignment.</v>

43
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.093
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

44
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.850
<v Speaker 4>when I ever get the facts right,</v>

45
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Bush may have been heavy handed and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way he spoke for democracy,</v>

46
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>but at least he spoke to democracy.</v>

47
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.020
<v Speaker 4>He has the same enemies as the previous </v>
<v Speaker 4>administrations,</v>

48
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 4>but that he deals with these enemies in </v>
<v Speaker 4>a way more wise and we mall.</v>

49
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.123
<v Speaker 4>I said poison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say with more boys than his </v>

50
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.500
<v Speaker 4>predecessor was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

51
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.183
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>
