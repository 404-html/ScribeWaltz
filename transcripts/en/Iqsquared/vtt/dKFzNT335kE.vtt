1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Just let me say a few of the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>messages,</v>

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.933
<v Speaker 1>I mean other people think that you still</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to wait for new brakes with </v>

3
00:00:04.941 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 1>technology and I don't think that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.823
<v Speaker 1>We have to existing technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have to break through and that </v>

5
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>doesn't come by itself and uncle venture</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas and America wasn't a big surprise to</v>

6
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:16.704
<v Speaker 1>everyone say in the last decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the first pioneers were already out </v>

7
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 1>there trying to develop the technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the eighties.</v>

8
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.013
<v Speaker 1>So it takes a few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about three decades for new technology </v>

9
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:31.280
<v Speaker 1>to really come through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very normal timespan,</v>

10
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the energy industry,</v>

11
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.793
<v Speaker 1>this industry to actually have new </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies coming on stream to about </v>

12
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:38.004
<v Speaker 1>one percent market share when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually becomes competitive with </v>

13
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.883
<v Speaker 1>existing incumbents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bear that in mind three decades </v>

14
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>before it becomes competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another three decades before it actually</v>

15
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>reaches and notch natural market share.</v>

16
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's really Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>intergenerational game.</v>

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Then the other aspect is something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiency.</v>

18
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>A lot of policy is based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiency that we're going to improve.</v>

19
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Saudi has something built in around 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the next 25 years.</v>

20
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.410
<v Speaker 1>But efficiency doesn't come by itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has his own dilemmas,</v>

21
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.293
<v Speaker 1>policy dilemmas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know who's going to pay for </v>

22
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:12.954
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if an end consumer not have the </v>

23
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>expectation that end consumer price will</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuously rise,</v>

24
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.983
<v Speaker 1>why would you invest now upfront a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of money to invest in efficiency while </v>

25
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.593
<v Speaker 1>governments normally liked to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy should be more affordable and </v>

26
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>cheaper every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's kind of dichotomy to breach.</v>

27
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Another critical technology which we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to really come to grips with.</v>

28
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.313
<v Speaker 1>Zoom is carbon capture and sequestration</v>
<v Speaker 1>CCS really to decarbonize the power </v>

29
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.124
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid if you want a lower carbon </v>

30
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do without a technological fix</v>

31
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>called carbon capture and sequestration.</v>
