00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.033
<v Speaker 1>Just having read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having heard a bit of Satan tonight and </v>

2
00:00:02.871 --> 00:00:03.704
<v Speaker 1>having read a bit of Macbeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a thing when you play a </v>

3
00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Baddie in Shakespeare where you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic,</v>

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>you can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.323
<v Speaker 1>we have Patrick Stewart playing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic child murderer in the west </v>

6
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:18.134
<v Speaker 1>end on the same day that we feel our </v>
<v Speaker 1>front pages of the tabloids with </v>

7
00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:24.950
<v Speaker 1>terrible things about child murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very odd,</v>

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm a coexistence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

9
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.610
<v Speaker 1>you have to leap the tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Train at some point as an audience,</v>

10
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>as it careers towards the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bloody buffers.</v>

11
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.283
<v Speaker 1>You have to lose sympathy for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however much he carries you along </v>

12
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.413
<v Speaker 1>because he's going to be damned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't happen with Satan because </v>

13
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:49.064
<v Speaker 1>he's not human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the worst thing that can happen </v>

14
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.430
<v Speaker 1>too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already happened.</v>

15
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.400
<v Speaker 1>And so Milton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it struck me tonight,</v>

16
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.263
<v Speaker 1>has done a sort of extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary high jump imaginatively </v>

17
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>and morally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

18
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.640
<v Speaker 1>he's given you this person who has all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best shoes.</v>

19
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.270
<v Speaker 1>I've given you sympathy for the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.700
<v Speaker 1>which is also a great team.</v>

21
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh Huh.</v>

22
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.453
<v Speaker 1>And then he sort of made it impossible </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to withdraw your sympathy from </v>

23
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>him because he's so clearly having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse time than you are.</v>

24
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.960
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not sure Shakespeare never quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>

25
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.403
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just wanted to say that I think </v>

26
00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:26.914
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you quite a sort of vertigo,</v>

28
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>morally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's extraordinary.</v>
