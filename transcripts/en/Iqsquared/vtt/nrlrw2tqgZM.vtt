1
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who are the chronic for and why is it</v>

2
00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:04.794
<v Speaker 1>important for a post 2015 a agreement on</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable development to think about </v>

3
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:11.244
<v Speaker 1>the chronic coupon there are getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto a half a billion people who are </v>

4
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.663
<v Speaker 1>poor over many years or for a lifetime </v>
<v Speaker 1>or possibly pass that property on to </v>

5
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>their children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're trapped in poverty,</v>

6
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.063
<v Speaker 1>partly because of politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because of the institutions of </v>

7
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which don't operate in their favor.</v>

8
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.193
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't just because of a dearth </v>
<v Speaker 1>of opportunities or a lack of economic </v>

9
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:38.904
<v Speaker 1>growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although that is obviously very </v>

10
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does it take to,</v>

11
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.633
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get people permanently out of poverty </v>

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>and address chronic poverty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 1>and what can an international framework </v>
<v Speaker 1>do to help this on its way?</v>

14
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.163
<v Speaker 1>It takes good politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive policies to improve the </v>

15
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:00.450
<v Speaker 1>situations of these longterm poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

16
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:01.284
<v Speaker 1>Measures like social assistance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing children through school for many </v>

17
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>age of pro poorest growth,</v>

18
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.563
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>initiatives and a political society </v>

19
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:14.390
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>begins to recognize the needs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests of chronic keep white people.</v>

21
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't happen very often because </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronically bought people don't organize</v>

22
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>themselves very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they need allies.</v>

23
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>The international community can be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ally for the chronically poor.</v>

24
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>They can set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty eradication goal and targets,</v>

26
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:41.751
<v Speaker 1>which really address chronic poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can desegregate progress so that we</v>

27
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:48.591
<v Speaker 1>look at the progress made by the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>5% 10% 20% of the population.</v>

28
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

29
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 1>set specific goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

30
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.170
<v Speaker 1>seeing children through nine or 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

31
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.113
<v Speaker 1>of education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality education to help them get out </v>

32
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.533
<v Speaker 1>of poverty so they can be a major ally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>International community can be a major </v>

33
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:08.400
<v Speaker 1>ally for the chronic important.</v>
