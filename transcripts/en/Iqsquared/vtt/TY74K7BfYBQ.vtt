1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.760
<v Speaker 1>It's almost become an orthodoxy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to say,</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.833
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>magna Carta is a bit of an irrelevant </v>

3
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>piece of Gulf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is irrelevant Gulf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very important not for what</v>

5
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.144
<v Speaker 1>it meant in 1215 but for the symbol that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became and for the significance that </v>

6
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:23.421
<v Speaker 1>it acquired as part of the common law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to give you what seems to me to be a</v>

7
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:25.674
<v Speaker 1>good example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blackstone's commentaries on the law </v>

8
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:32.691
<v Speaker 1>of England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the classic 18th century text of English</v>

9
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.223
<v Speaker 1>common law principles published in 1765 </v>
<v Speaker 1>blackstone when considering the notion </v>

10
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.363
<v Speaker 1>of absolute fundamental rights under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>English constitution takes us his </v>

11
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>starting point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Magna Carta,</v>

12
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:48.684
<v Speaker 1>which he calls that great charter </v>
<v Speaker 1>obtained at the point of a sword and he </v>

13
00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Speaker 1>identifies from magna Carta three </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental rights,</v>

14
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.173
<v Speaker 1>which actually I think you can discern </v>
<v Speaker 1>in clause 39 the right to life or </v>

15
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:05.754
<v Speaker 1>personal autonomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to liberty and the right to </v>

16
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>private property.</v>

17
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Because what clause 39 says is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot apply force to somebody.</v>

18
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:15.384
<v Speaker 1>You cannot exile them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot take their property and you </v>

19
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:18.234
<v Speaker 1>cannot imprison them without judgment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their peers or without the application </v>

20
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from those,</v>

21
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.683
<v Speaker 1>from that principal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he identifies those three fundamental </v>

22
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he says this,</v>

23
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:29.424
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order for those three fundamental </v>

24
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:32.364
<v Speaker 1>rights to have any purchase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they must be supported by ancillary </v>

25
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:37.404
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he identifies three of those as </v>

26
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:40.374
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is the rights and privileges </v>

27
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:43.374
<v Speaker 1>of parliament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second is the limitations on the </v>

28
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:46.944
<v Speaker 1>royal prerogative and on the executive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the third is the right of access to </v>

29
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>justice and the significance of close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close,</v>

30
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:56.694
<v Speaker 1>40 to no man will we sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delay or deny justice is that that </v>

31
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>encapsulates the notion of access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice so that what you have,</v>

32
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:09.441
<v Speaker 1>I think a magna Carta is the kernel of </v>
<v Speaker 1>two basic constitutional principles.</v>

33
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.053
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rule of law and the protection of </v>

34
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>fundamental rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And secondly,</v>

35
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>the need for access to court to support </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rule of law.</v>

36
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>And that concept runs through the common</v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

37
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.853
<v Speaker 1>You can see it in modern case law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>important cases like with them about </v>

38
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>access to justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical justice,</v>

39
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>and whether you're actually citing magna</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carta and I ice eyesight,</v>

40
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.713
<v Speaker 1>blackstone's commentaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've done it in many cases and it </v>

41
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>gets much more purchase with a common </v>
<v Speaker 1>law judge in many occasions.</v>

42
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:45.060
<v Speaker 1>And the Human Rights Act does because </v>
<v Speaker 1>blackstone's speaks to the breast of the</v>

43
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:45.894
<v Speaker 1>judges in the common law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the origin of those principles </v>

44
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.613
<v Speaker 1>ultimately is a magna Carta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at a case like the are </v>

45
00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:52.804
<v Speaker 1>raw we decision that said that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>common law would not tolerate secret </v>

46
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:56.574
<v Speaker 1>courts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a passionate declaration by the </v>

47
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Supreme Court of the importance of basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles of open justice,</v>

48
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ultimately have their origin,</v>

49
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.383
<v Speaker 1>not in Magna Carta itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Magna Carta as a symbol as it's </v>

50
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>developed over the following 800 years.</v>
