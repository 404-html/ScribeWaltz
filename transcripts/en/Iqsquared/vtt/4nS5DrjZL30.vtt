<v Speaker 1>Square</v>

2
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.740
<v Speaker 2>in 1993,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boutros Boutros Oh,</v>

3
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 2>could also be called Boutros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boutros Boutros rally.</v>

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.713
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was secretary general of United </v>

5
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Nations and eminent French defied the </v>
<v Speaker 2>option who in 1993 he said,</v>

6
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:28.344
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says we have to have democracy in </v>

7
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 2>Somalia for which we will have to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>the economy,</v>

8
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 2>rebuild the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to have to build.</v>

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 2>The political institutions will have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>brill,</v>

10
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.550
<v Speaker 2>build a democratic state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will have to build the court system left</v>

11
00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 2>to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to do that.</v>

12
00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:48.921
<v Speaker 2>And the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that seems like a completely lunatic</v>

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.513
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go to a place like </v>

14
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Somalia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to build these things,</v>

15
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 2>but reflect Boutros,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boutros,</v>

16
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.573
<v Speaker 2>Boutros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ghali came from Egypt and in Egypt they </v>

17
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:04.401
<v Speaker 2>have parliament that courts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have all of these things coexisting</v>

18
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 2>with an undiminished dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for embroiders galleys idea,</v>

19
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 2>you just go and set up.</v>

20
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 2>You'll get a building and you call it </v>
<v Speaker 2>the parliament building.</v>

21
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.203
<v Speaker 2>You create another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another building called the electoral </v>

22
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 2>commission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have.</v>

23
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 2>You will summon different people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

24
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:22.674
<v Speaker 2>you're going to organize the Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Party and you're going to organize the </v>

25
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 2>central party and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>organize the patriotic party.</v>

26
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:29.304
<v Speaker 2>You better be smart about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that was the idea of creating </v>

27
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:33.744
<v Speaker 2>democracy for the secretary general of </v>
<v Speaker 2>United Nations in 1993 was something </v>

28
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:41.790
<v Speaker 2>that was very straightforward because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you had the Egyptian case,</v>

29
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 2>a great warning there in the case of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt,</v>

30
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:45.834
<v Speaker 2>because you'll have all the forms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the externally created externally </v>

31
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:50.934
<v Speaker 2>induced forms which actually provide </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely comfortable framework for a </v>

32
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:57.174
<v Speaker 2>dictatorship.</v>

33
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.620
<v Speaker 3>If you believe that the unity of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity is broken,</v>

34
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 3>that it is separated into humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like specialists and different space,</v>

35
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:11.950
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you are completely disarmed.</v>

36
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.263
<v Speaker 3>You have no weapon and no tool to </v>
<v Speaker 3>protest or to react to a flagrant </v>

37
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.893
<v Speaker 3>injustice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bloodbath or gen site in the name of </v>

38
00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:28.444
<v Speaker 3>what should you react to the genocide in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rwanda or to the beginning of genocide </v>

39
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.773
<v Speaker 3>in Darfur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't believe that democracy is </v>

40
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:40.390
<v Speaker 3>for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you believe like,</v>

41
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.753
<v Speaker 3>hey girl and Spangler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that humanity in divided into different </v>

42
00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:49.321
<v Speaker 3>spaces and so on and so that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you oppose the motion,</v>

43
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.923
<v Speaker 3>it is not because I believe that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>shall build all of a sudden tomorrow </v>

44
00:02:58.271 --> 00:03:03.271
<v Speaker 3>morning a fake British parliamentary </v>
<v Speaker 3>democracy in the disaster,</v>

45
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.210
<v Speaker 3>the inhabited areas of dark pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I visited a few weeks ago.</v>

46
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.713
<v Speaker 3>Of course not in these parts of Africa </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the human cleansing has been </v>

47
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:16.384
<v Speaker 3>nearly achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course windows have them ocracy </v>

48
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.883
<v Speaker 3>coming from from the soil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but believing that democracy is for </v>

49
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.690
<v Speaker 3>everyone just means that you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>enhance some tools,</v>

50
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 3>some arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some worlds,</v>

51
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.040
<v Speaker 3>some values which are low you to condemn</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is happening.</v>

52
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in doctoral.</v>
