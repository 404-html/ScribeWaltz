00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>The idea that the benefit system </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetuates misery is not something that</v>

2
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:11.421
<v Speaker 1>I'm a stranger to have everyday when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked doors as has been highlighted in</v>

3
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 1>areas where people are struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in work and are struggling,</v>

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.993
<v Speaker 1>they will point out their neighbors to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me about how they're wrong ends and she </v>

5
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:20.094
<v Speaker 1>never goes out to work and he doesn't go</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to work and the kids are in the </v>

6
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>garden and that was always a perception </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is somebody next door getting</v>

7
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>something that you are not getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I asked the people.</v>

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>My response is always would you swap </v>
<v Speaker 1>places?</v>

9
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.633
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going out to work their lives </v>

10
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:39.090
<v Speaker 1>really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you go?</v>

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Would you swap places?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is all,</v>

12
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:42.594
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what makes you think those people </v>

13
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>chose it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either.</v>

14
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.763
<v Speaker 1>What makes you think your life is is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>different to theirs that they chose </v>

15
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 1>something completely different to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many reasons why people end up</v>

16
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>with benefits and the lady in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience has highlighted one of them.</v>

17
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.763
<v Speaker 1>We should stop treating these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they are not like us because one </v>

18
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:02.784
<v Speaker 1>day they will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all of us will fall and need the </v>

19
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>benefits system if we haven't already.</v>
