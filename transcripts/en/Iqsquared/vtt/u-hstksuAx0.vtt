1
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.330
<v Speaker 1>That we've witnessed innocent people </v>
<v Speaker 1>being slaughtered on an industrial scale</v>

2
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.323
<v Speaker 1>in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My feeling is now one that you cannot </v>

3
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.943
<v Speaker 1>allow an armed mafia to take revenge on </v>
<v Speaker 1>an entire country without allowing some </v>

4
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:28.584
<v Speaker 1>protection for civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what that kind of protection might </v>

5
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 1>take is something that we have all </v>
<v Speaker 1>Assyrians debated very painfully.</v>

6
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.933
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy thing to say with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of Iraq fresh in our mind that </v>

7
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do want military intervention,</v>

8
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.653
<v Speaker 1>but I think what we do absolutely need </v>
<v Speaker 1>our safe corridors that would enable </v>

9
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>families of displaced persons to reach </v>
<v Speaker 1>safety without being killed.</v>

10
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>We would need safe corridors for </v>
<v Speaker 1>defectors.</v>

11
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>The reason we don't have the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>detection on a large scale from the army</v>

12
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.763
<v Speaker 1>is because the price of defection is </v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerably high and it's not just the </v>

13
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>people that affect your shot.</v>

14
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.390
<v Speaker 2>When people hear the phrase safe </v>
<v Speaker 2>corridor,</v>

15
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 2>think who could be against safe corridor</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

16
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.440
<v Speaker 2>it sounds wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to do that,</v>

17
00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:24.274
<v Speaker 2>to enforce it will mean heavy duty and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that what will others that are not in </v>

18
00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:31.534
<v Speaker 2>the room now worn is that that will mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge unleashing of the kind of blood </v>

19
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 2>boil.</v>

20
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already have a blood bath of.</v>

21
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I,</v>

22
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.973
<v Speaker 2>I want to get in on this because I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to know just how it felt when you were </v>

23
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 2>there that moment when you were an </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack,</v>

24
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 2>but even before then when you saw people</v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

25
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.583
<v Speaker 2>Did you yourself think the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve this is the outside world has to </v>

26
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.760
<v Speaker 2>act?</v>

27
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.670
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one thing,</v>

28
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.180
<v Speaker 3>I guess seeing it from a distance to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in it,</v>

29
00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:02.014
<v Speaker 3>to watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch people dying for a piece of </v>

30
00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:04.924
<v Speaker 3>bread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the risks people were taking just to </v>

31
00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 3>feed themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

32
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.530
<v Speaker 3>there is no option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

33
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.410
<v Speaker 3>they are a well trained army,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was actually pointed out to me by</v>

34
00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:15.244
<v Speaker 3>many military defectors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high level military defectors that the </v>

35
00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:20.020
<v Speaker 3>Syrian army is a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful arm.</v>

36
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:25.021
<v Speaker 3>It's also not an army that is actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained to fight was whether the army as</v>

37
00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:25.924
<v Speaker 3>an army base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are several suppression of </v>

38
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.850
<v Speaker 3>civilians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when it comes to taking out,</v>

39
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.560
<v Speaker 3>as would be the case if we're to create </v>
<v Speaker 3>safe and safe havens,</v>

40
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.853
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not such big guys when it comes </v>

41
00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:42.034
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very good that I'm surrounded </v>

42
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:44.950
<v Speaker 3>civilians and killing them.</v>

43
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.873
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the kind of remedies that Michael </v>

44
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Weiss has application application using </v>
<v Speaker 2>the price wouldn't be so unbearable.</v>

45
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

46
00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:54.040
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

47
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.880
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

48
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.713
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we overestimate the scale and the size </v>

49
00:02:57.991 --> 00:02:58.824
<v Speaker 3>of the city and capability to fight back</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it is an army and civilian </v>

50
00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:05.034
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>
