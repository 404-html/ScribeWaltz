00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the situation has gone too far.</v>

2
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.673
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will not be possible I think to get </v>

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>the opposition to sit down with a sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where,</v>

5
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>where does that leave us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my view,</v>

6
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.340
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.550
<v Speaker 1>you have to try to level the playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>field and do so as quickly as possible.</v>

8
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Now we've seen the decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:34.944
<v Speaker 1>in Istanbul a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can assure you there's a lot more </v>

10
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:38.411
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

11
00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced,</v>

12
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beneath the radar.</v>

13
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:43.134
<v Speaker 1>paying salaries to the FSA and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly they're gonna be put on some </v>

15
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>payroll or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we need to get cash and a,</v>

17
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.663
<v Speaker 1>to the opposition that there are ways to</v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage the process of defections a </v>

19
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>that's already going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this has to be pursued as,</v>

20
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.833
<v Speaker 1>as energetically as possible in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt the asad regime and begin to get </v>

21
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>the kind of balance where some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiated outcome might be possible.</v>

22
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Roger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just before we go on there,</v>

23
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>when you say giving cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you go further and say arms,</v>

24
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>its arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arms,</v>

25
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.600
<v Speaker 1>cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logistics,</v>

27
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where with the,</v>

28
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned I'm not in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

29
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>in an election year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>with Iran hovering in the background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>with Israel where it is on Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't see a NATO planes in the skies </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a Siri.</v>

33
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:37.474
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to deal here with realistic </v>

35
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:39.924
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't regard that as a real estate </v>

36
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ain't going to happen,</v>

37
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>at least not in my view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that leaves me,</v>

38
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.213
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that I don't think the Annan plan </v>

39
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:50.094
<v Speaker 1>can work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that leaves me with a arm support </v>

40
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>bolster</v>
<v Speaker 1>the FSA,</v>

41
00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:56.874
<v Speaker 1>the rebels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and try and get them to be as coherent </v>

42
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>and effective as possible.</v>
