<v Speaker 1>Nuclear power today is available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it produces only very small amounts of </v>

2
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>very well confined waste and it does not</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute to global warming.</v>

3
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>This is the reason to better inform the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public why I created Efn,</v>

4
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.550
<v Speaker 1>the Association of Environmental Guess </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Nuclear Energy,</v>

5
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>which gathers today over 7,000 members </v>
<v Speaker 1>and supporters in 53 countries.</v>

6
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>For more information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can refer to our website,</v>

7
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>and this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

8
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.700
<v Speaker 1>I consider as an environmentalist that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear energy must absolutely power our</v>

9
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider this sizewell B,</v>

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>which has already been mentioned in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these timeless stores,</v>

11
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:49.224
<v Speaker 1>its own fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has about 300 tons of volatile fuel </v>

12
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>in a relatively unguarded pond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively calm in comparison with other</v>

13
00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:57.504
<v Speaker 1>parts of the plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the power supply was deliberately </v>

14
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:01.494
<v Speaker 1>isolated from the plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the emergency generators were </v>

15
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:04.554
<v Speaker 1>crippled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water that keeps that fueled cool </v>

16
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:07.524
<v Speaker 1>and relatively stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what evaporates and the fuel would </v>

17
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>explode with horrific consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for me,</v>

18
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:14.154
<v Speaker 1>it's not comforting to think that we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>never more than a few hours away from a </v>

19
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>nuclear explosion.</v>
