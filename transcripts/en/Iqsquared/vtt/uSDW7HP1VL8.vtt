00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>I agree that there is a lot wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.570
<v Speaker 1>It's hostility to Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's appalling human rights record,</v>

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.673
<v Speaker 1>but I doubt that that record is worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that of Egypt or Saudi Arabia and </v>

4
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>we don't hear much from the West about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

5
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Thank you,</v>

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.153
<v Speaker 1>but there is another side to Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The revolutionaries are growing older </v>

7
00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:26.194
<v Speaker 1>and have a country to run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a country with significant </v>

8
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:29.624
<v Speaker 1>elements of democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a large Christian population and </v>

9
00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:34.184
<v Speaker 1>also a significant Jewish population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest but small Jewish population </v>

10
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:39.974
<v Speaker 1>in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside Israel that even represented in </v>

11
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:43.394
<v Speaker 1>the Iranian parliament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran has made overtures in the past </v>

12
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:50.690
<v Speaker 1>about improving relations with the West </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2003.</v>

13
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.130
<v Speaker 1>It supported the American invasion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan at the same time.</v>

14
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.293
<v Speaker 1>It proposed normalizing relations with </v>
<v Speaker 1>us and he offered to rein back at </v>

15
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.163
<v Speaker 1>support for Hezbollah and Hamas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Jack Straw said all it got was </v>

16
00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:09.680
<v Speaker 1>to be called part of the access for </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

17
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Iran unfortunately has many reasons to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be distrustful of the West,</v>

18
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.003
<v Speaker 1>the coup against Dr Moosa Deck simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he wanted to run soil for Iran </v>

19
00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:20.474
<v Speaker 1>rather than for UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are maintaining the shine power along </v>

20
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:29.051
<v Speaker 1>with the notorious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most most sad supported secret police in</v>

21
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:30.434
<v Speaker 1>1983 of us shot down in Iranian civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>airliner killing 290 people and then </v>

22
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:40.550
<v Speaker 1>there was the help the west gave Sudan </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying when he invaded in Iran,</v>

23
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>security insecurity and the mentality of</v>

24
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:46.454
<v Speaker 1>Iran without understanding the Iran Iraq</v>
<v Speaker 1>war and the fact that they lost almost </v>

25
00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:55.421
<v Speaker 1>as many people in that war as we lost in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Second World War Iran.</v>

26
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Iran is not going to become the ally of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the West overnight,</v>

27
00:02:03.521 --> 00:02:04.354
<v Speaker 1>if at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are common interests that we </v>

28
00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:11.341
<v Speaker 1>have like fighting the Islamic state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iranians are not apocalyptic millenarian</v>

29
00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:13.804
<v Speaker 1>madmen wanting to blow the world up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that this deal gives us the </v>

30
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 1>best hope of improving relations with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran.</v>

31
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.503
<v Speaker 1>We have surely learned enough from our </v>
<v Speaker 1>disasters actions in the past to prefer </v>

32
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:28.334
<v Speaker 1>a negotiated settlement rather than to </v>
<v Speaker 1>push us yet again into another </v>

33
00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:34.450
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic war in the Middle East.</v>

34
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
