00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.423
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to leave you with a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>very simple prescriptions in terms of </v>

2
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:06.684
<v Speaker 1>what what we can do so we can stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about mothers and start talking </v>

3
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>about parents every time you want to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

4
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say parents and children,</v>

5
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.173
<v Speaker 1>parents and family stopped talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughters and start talking about </v>

6
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>caregivers are in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carers,</v>

7
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.233
<v Speaker 1>carers for parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether their sons or daughters stopped </v>

8
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:39.561
<v Speaker 1>talking about fathers and start talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about earners or providers.</v>

9
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Both men and women</v>
<v Speaker 1>start assuming that every everybody,</v>

10
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.633
<v Speaker 1>men and women want some combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to invest in themselves and </v>

11
00:00:55.681 --> 00:01:00.150
<v Speaker 1>to invest in others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone and that all workers,</v>

12
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.313
<v Speaker 1>all employees will have caregiving </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities at some point in their </v>

13
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>lives and a competitive effective </v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace.</v>

14
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.063
<v Speaker 1>Efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive will make room for that kind </v>

15
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.783
<v Speaker 1>of care and start assuming that </v>
<v Speaker 1>investing in others is every bit as </v>

16
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>important and rewarding and valuable as </v>
<v Speaker 1>investing in ourselves.</v>

17
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would call it equalism.</v>

18
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>I think a Galitary aneurysm is better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe isms are not the way to go.</v>

19
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.543
<v Speaker 1>What we are looking for is a world in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which we don't assume everyone is the </v>

20
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely not,</v>

21
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.333
<v Speaker 1>but a world in which our assumptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>about who someone is and what they want </v>

22
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>and what they can achieve and what their</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential is is not tied to their sex or</v>

23
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:07.251
<v Speaker 1>their gender or their sexual orientation</v>
<v Speaker 1>any more than it is tied to the shape of</v>

24
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>their features or the color of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>

25
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
