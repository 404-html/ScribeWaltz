1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.163
<v Speaker 1>The average time a person spends and </v>
<v Speaker 1>displacement or refugee spends and </v>

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>displacement to 17 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the average time.</v>

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>We have people that are born and bred </v>
<v Speaker 1>and grow up in refugee camps.</v>

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>The Syrians that have been sitting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Syria,</v>

5
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:14.770
<v Speaker 1>in Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lebanon and,</v>

6
00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>and then moved on to Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.540
<v Speaker 1>have not been able to access the bare </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum of,</v>

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>of subsistence for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have talked to people that have moved</v>

9
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>on because they haven't found education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decent education for their children,</v>

10
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.743
<v Speaker 1>healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this really speaks to the </v>

11
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.353
<v Speaker 1>beginnings of the refugee regime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The refugee regime was crafted in 1951 </v>

12
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.523
<v Speaker 1>it was crafted at a time and a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where persecution was the reason for </v>

13
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:42.084
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Civil and political rights were </v>

14
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 1>privileged over economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social and cultural rights.</v>

15
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>The idea of somebody moving because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw no future for themselves,</v>

16
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>they saw no future for their family with</v>
<v Speaker 1>was somehow put in a second tier.</v>

17
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.673
<v Speaker 1>But what we are seeing now is precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>people saying that that's not the way </v>

18
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:00.354
<v Speaker 1>that we can live our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have the right to work in </v>

19
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:03.534
<v Speaker 1>Turkey in Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no education for our children </v>

20
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>and no health care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense,</v>

21
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.653
<v Speaker 1>this is what you're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing the combination of a </v>

22
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>governance system that is in desperate </v>
<v Speaker 1>need of fixing.</v>
