00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.653
<v Speaker 1>We must reject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say fundamentally the idea of </v>

2
00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:11.230
<v Speaker 1>those deportations to torture it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.520
<v Speaker 1>It undermines the very values that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are fighting to defend.</v>

4
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.193
<v Speaker 1>It undermines democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rule of law and basic human rights </v>

5
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.513
<v Speaker 1>and human rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the only universal language of </v>

6
00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:25.294
<v Speaker 1>mankind that transcends national </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity that transcends religious and </v>

7
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:33.340
<v Speaker 1>cultural differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we start losing them,</v>

8
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.890
<v Speaker 1>we have no language and they're basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles,</v>

9
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.903
<v Speaker 1>the to talk to other people in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures and other nations in other </v>

10
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>racial groups for if we started </v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoning them and then they'll say,</v>

11
00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:49.030
<v Speaker 1>you've got no moral authority at all to </v>
<v Speaker 1>preach to us,</v>

12
00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:52.660
<v Speaker 1>to talk to us or to tell us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I asked you to vote for justice.</v>

13
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.763
<v Speaker 1>I asked you to vote for reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked you to vote against rough </v>

14
00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:57.304
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
