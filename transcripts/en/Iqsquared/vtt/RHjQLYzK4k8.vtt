00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons for the current </v>
<v Speaker 1>reemergence of frozen sniffed,</v>

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.203
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that sniffed potentially a together </v>

3
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:15.411
<v Speaker 1>with international companies could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

4
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.220
<v Speaker 1>this place Gazprom troll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think just focusing on gas from.</v>

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really entirely accurate.</v>

6
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.540
<v Speaker 1>I think you should look at when we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about this,</v>

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.633
<v Speaker 1>these issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to look at what the independent </v>

8
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>producers can do and can deliver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.740
<v Speaker 1>which volumes we're talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

10
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.633
<v Speaker 1>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us at the moment,</v>

12
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I think the key dilemmas to retain his </v>
<v Speaker 1>role in,</v>

13
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>in European markets potentially maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase it slightly.</v>
