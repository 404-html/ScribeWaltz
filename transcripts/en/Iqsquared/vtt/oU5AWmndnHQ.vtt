00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.013
<v Speaker 1>Square,</v>

2
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.453
<v Speaker 2>I know that David didn't take up my </v>
<v Speaker 2>invitation to embarrass himself </v>

3
00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:24.304
<v Speaker 2>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps you could tackle him </v>

4
00:00:25.181 --> 00:00:30.181
<v Speaker 2>privately afterwards at the bar and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to announce the results,</v>

5
00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:31.114
<v Speaker 2>which is</v>

6
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.060
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>

7
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.163
<v Speaker 2>The number of don't knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the confusion on the panel has </v>

8
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:44.111
<v Speaker 2>gone down from 100 to 16</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the debate.</v>

9
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.290
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 66 people believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the baby boomers,</v>

10
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:50.630
<v Speaker 2>it's still in the family silver after </v>
<v Speaker 2>the debate,</v>

11
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.170
<v Speaker 2>only $135 and 235 people no longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in the motion.</v>

12
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.260
<v Speaker 2>So it's certainly a victory for frank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your age and possibly Laurian dead.</v>

13
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Thank you all very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed.</v>
