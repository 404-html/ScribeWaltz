00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.470
<v Speaker 1>But John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1997,</v>

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>the NHS budget was 33 point 5 billion in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2010.</v>

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>It was 115 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Is that not a triplet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing cash to carry.</v>

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.023
<v Speaker 1>Do it in real terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be used in real </v>

6
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:20.500
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about the NHS budget.</v>

7
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking about cash?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking?</v>

8
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>You don't talk in real terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in real terms,</v>

9
00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:25.790
<v Speaker 1>budgets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

10
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>this is the whole problem with arguing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this exact problem.</v>

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.220
<v Speaker 1>My family stays on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the whole problem which the book</v>

12
00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:36.730
<v Speaker 1>cuts through every time one says </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

13
00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:37.564
<v Speaker 1>which is based on the fact the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government publishes the statistics say </v>

14
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.240
<v Speaker 1>the government spending on nhs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems simple,</v>

15
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>is 33 point 5 billion and in 2010 is </v>
<v Speaker 1>over 110 billion.</v>

16
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.023
<v Speaker 1>There is no dispute about that and yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment labor people of their rights </v>

17
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.600
<v Speaker 1>get a fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try and twist and turn it so that,</v>

18
00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:56.434
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now when Professor Brown eloquently </v>

19
00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:01.450
<v Speaker 1>explained the decline of math education </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Britain,</v>

20
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.020
<v Speaker 1>matthew immediately jumped to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

21
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 1>it's because the housing problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem.</v>
