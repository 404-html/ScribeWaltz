00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.453
<v Speaker 1>There's a new hierarchy and tone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the hierarchy of Silicon Valley to </v>

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.990
<v Speaker 1>the people who run these companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an astonishing sense of power,</v>

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.333
<v Speaker 1>but in the last 12 months there's been a</v>
<v Speaker 1>realization that as they say in the </v>

4
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>spiderman movies with great power comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>great responsibility and a great deal of</v>

5
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>trouble too if you don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manage that responsibility.</v>

6
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.111
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil,</v>

7
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Speaker 1>most of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if probably all,</v>

8
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:30.834
<v Speaker 1>almost all of those silicon valley </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet billionaires would have </v>

9
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>preferred Hillary Clinton of compressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States and she didn't.</v>

10
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.090
<v Speaker 1>So to their utter horror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it really was,</v>

11
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>it was really kind of fascinating to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch up close.</v>

12
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.513
<v Speaker 1>They found that the network platforms </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd created could be used to achieve </v>

13
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:55.191
<v Speaker 1>the opposite of what they had intended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not the Clinton administration,</v>

14
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.203
<v Speaker 1>the Clinton campaign that knew how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use facebook to target advertising in </v>

15
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>order to secure the swing states.</v>

16
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>It was the trump campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Steve Bannon and jared Kushner,</v>

17
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.513
<v Speaker 1>not to mention Russian intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are in the midst of a great </v>

18
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.970
<v Speaker 1>expose a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not over,</v>

19
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.283
<v Speaker 1>that is going to reveal the extent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>which trump campaign in a large way and </v>

20
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:21.954
<v Speaker 1>the Russian intelligence network in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>small way used facebook and to a lesser </v>

21
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:26.844
<v Speaker 1>extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other platforms to achieve victory in </v>

22
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>the 2016 presidential election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I argue in the book,</v>

23
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>and I stand by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Donald Trump would not be president</v>

24
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:37.344
<v Speaker 1>today if there had not been facebook and</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter and the other platforms that </v>

25
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.430
<v Speaker 1>were used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>in a conventional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional American election campaign,</v>

27
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.023
<v Speaker 1>he would have been defeated because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would've been out spent Hillary Clinton </v>

28
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>outspent Donald Trump two to one more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than two to one,</v>

29
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.833
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on standard cable and terrestrial </v>

30
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>television advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have lost.</v>

31
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>So this was a hugely significant moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>in American political history.</v>

32
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.753
<v Speaker 1>I still don't think people realize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extent to which it depended on the use </v>

33
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>of facebook in particular.</v>
