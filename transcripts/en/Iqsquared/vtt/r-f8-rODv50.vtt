00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.793
<v Speaker 1>Today in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more people die from eating too much </v>

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.640
<v Speaker 1>than from eating too little for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time in history.</v>

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.743
<v Speaker 1>I think the last data for the World </v>
<v Speaker 1>Health Organization says that about 3 </v>

4
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.190
<v Speaker 1>million people die each year from </v>
<v Speaker 1>obesity and related diseases compared to</v>

5
00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:26.191
<v Speaker 1>1 million people that die from </v>
<v Speaker 1>starvation and malnutrition as a st time</v>

6
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>for the first time in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more people dying from old age than from</v>

7
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.210
<v Speaker 1>infectious diseases and also for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time in history,</v>

8
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>more people commit suicide each year </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the total number of death from war,</v>

9
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 1>crime and terrorism put together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very good news.</v>

10
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the suicide bit front that affected.</v>

11
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.543
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

12
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's suicides of went up.</v>

13
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.110
<v Speaker 1>It's the death from violence has gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>down today.</v>

14
00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Let's say for the people here in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>

15
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it's safe to say that Mcdonald's</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Coca Cola,</v>

16
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Paul's a far greater threat to your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>than al Qaeda and Islamic state.</v>

17
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>The chance that</v>

18
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.823
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

19
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.853
<v Speaker 1>the chance that you will die from eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much at Mcdonald's is about a </v>

20
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>thousand times higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is not an exaggeration.</v>

21
00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:30.944
<v Speaker 1>This is statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about a thousand times higher than </v>

22
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:38.630
<v Speaker 1>the chance will be killed by some </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic state terrorism attack.</v>
