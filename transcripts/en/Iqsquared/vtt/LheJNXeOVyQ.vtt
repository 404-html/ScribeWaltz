00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.170
<v Speaker 1>The Millennium Development Goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gavin,</v>

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I support for poverty reduction</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

3
00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:08.584
<v Speaker 1>the target of housing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of people living in extreme </v>

4
00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>poverty has been met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Progress has been uneven</v>

5
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.843
<v Speaker 1>as the United Nations and its partners </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape a new global framework to replace </v>

6
00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:20.774
<v Speaker 1>the mdgs in 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They faced the challenge of ending </v>

7
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:25.334
<v Speaker 1>poverty for good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means tackling some important </v>

8
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:30.950
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is poverty?</v>

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.283
<v Speaker 1>How is it measured?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poverty is not only the income and poor </v>

10
00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>people do not live only in poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries</v>

11
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.213
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new bottom billion live in middle </v>

12
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.690
<v Speaker 1>income countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including India and China.</v>

13
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.590
<v Speaker 1>It's also not just a question of getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to zero,</v>

14
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.963
<v Speaker 1>but staying there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the issue of where to fix </v>

15
00:00:57.351 --> 00:00:58.184
<v Speaker 1>the new development goal posts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recapture the Millennium Declarations </v>

16
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.240
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new international development agenda</v>

17
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 1>must embody principles of solidarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality,</v>

18
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 1>dignity and respect for nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

19
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 1>once these goals have been agreed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how will they be achieved?</v>

20
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.353
<v Speaker 1>We'll need new policies and leadership </v>
<v Speaker 1>by national governments and the global </v>

21
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what else?</v>

22
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>On the fifth of December,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2013,</v>

23
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.423
<v Speaker 1>we debated these questions and others </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the panel of world experts kick </v>

24
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>here to watch the arguments.</v>
