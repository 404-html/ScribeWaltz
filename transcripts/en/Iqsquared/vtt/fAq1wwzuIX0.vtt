<v Speaker 2>Mr Holocaust is a political prisoner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is in prison as a result of it.</v>

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Political conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why I punted,</v>

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.340
<v Speaker 2>that's 30 seconds of my time on the 1993</v>
<v Speaker 2>events.</v>

5
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.283
<v Speaker 2>It's because they relevant to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a political conflict about the </v>

6
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.270
<v Speaker 2>only choice available for posts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their societies.</v>

7
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Either they are going to be strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite authoritarian states,</v>

8
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.483
<v Speaker 2>societies that have been killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You destroyed about the Soviet system </v>

9
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.513
<v Speaker 2>with no separate institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>checks and balances or they will be </v>

10
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:40.070
<v Speaker 2>privatized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will be taken over.</v>

11
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.203
<v Speaker 2>Then we'll become oligarchs systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we saw in Russia in the </v>

12
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:46.580
<v Speaker 2>late 1990s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr Berry's Husky was an actor,</v>

13
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that process and to that extent we're</v>

14
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:51.860
<v Speaker 2>privileged to have him with us today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't be naive.</v>

15
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.110

<v Speaker 2>wants to bring back.</v>

16
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.540
<v Speaker 3>Was there some other process at work </v>
<v Speaker 3>that created these immensely wealthy and</v>

17
00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:02.410
<v Speaker 3>not just wealthy but incredibly powerful</v>
<v Speaker 3>families?</v>

18
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.930
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I understand it,</v>

19
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.823
<v Speaker 3>Mr. Pin sharp got a lot of his money </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was the beneficiary of state </v>

20
00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:11.290
<v Speaker 3>sells off of,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Iliana friendship,</v>

24
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:23.944
<v Speaker 3>describing herself as a philanthropist </v>
<v Speaker 3>because she gives some money to aids </v>

25
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 3>when so much money has been got by that </v>
<v Speaker 3>family from the Ukraine.</v>

26
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:33.214
