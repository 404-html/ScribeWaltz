1
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm Jonathan Friedland from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guardian.</v>

2
00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:11.224
<v Speaker 1>And great pleasure to be moderating or </v>
<v Speaker 1>chairing perhaps is more appropriate </v>

3
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:16.450
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.180
<v Speaker 1>our speakers and our debate for tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

5
00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:20.014
<v Speaker 1>the motion before us is the best chance </v>
<v Speaker 1>for peace between Israel and Palestine </v>

6
00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:28.630
<v Speaker 1>is for Uncle Sam to butt out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>American colloquialism.</v>

7
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.703
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite this being a intelligence </v>

8
00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:34.810
<v Speaker 1>squared in London and so much has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in the whole,</v>

9
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.750
<v Speaker 1>the wider Middle East across the Arab </v>
<v Speaker 1>world in particular,</v>

10
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.690
<v Speaker 1>the so called Arab spring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Arab awakening,</v>

11
00:00:40.691 --> 00:00:41.524
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you prefer to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people on both sides of the Israel </v>

12
00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Palestine conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.383
<v Speaker 1>who said some might accuse of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost addicted to the attention of the </v>

14
00:00:53.111 --> 00:00:56.770
<v Speaker 1>world have been slightly feeling left </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in recent months.</v>

15
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>

16
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention has moved away,</v>

17
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.701
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nevertheless,</v>

18
00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 1>that conflict does still go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.330
<v Speaker 1>and it's that one very particular aspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it that we want to explore tonight.</v>

20
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.643
<v Speaker 1>We are going to be doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>different in this debate from some </v>

21
00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:12.550
<v Speaker 1>debates on this conflict that you may </v>
<v Speaker 1>have heard before.</v>

22
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:13.384
<v Speaker 1>And it's different in this sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not aiming for perhaps sometimes </v>

23
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.733
<v Speaker 1>what can be accrued debate which pits </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israelis against Palestinians or even </v>

24
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:24.730
<v Speaker 1>friends of Israel against friends of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palestinians.</v>

25
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>

26
00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:27.034
<v Speaker 1>all four speakers tonight would insist </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are looking for solutions for </v>

27
00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:36.781
<v Speaker 1>indeed resolution rather than simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>defending one side or the other.</v>

28
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.463
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within that framework or within that </v>

29
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.373
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.293
<v Speaker 1>we will hope they are revealed tonight </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantial disagreements between them </v>

32
00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 1>about how best to achieve that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 1>resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

34
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>they are for people who are in their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways,</v>

35
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.220
<v Speaker 1>dedicate much of their professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives to wrestling with this subject and</v>

36
00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>they do it with huge commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 1>so I think we're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very lucky to have them and I'm going to</v>

38
00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 1>introduce them all one by one as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up to speak.</v>

39
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.290
<v Speaker 1>But first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to,</v>

40
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.143
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mention something that you will have </v>

41
00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:12.160
<v Speaker 1>been doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is costing your pre vote.</v>

43
00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you the result of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

44
00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:18.040
<v Speaker 1>The vote that you walked in with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vote before,</v>

45
00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:22.120
<v Speaker 1>you'd had a chance to be swayed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost scissor Romanian rhetoric that is</v>

46
00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 1>going to be unleashed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.580
<v Speaker 1>from this panel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

48
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.330
<v Speaker 1>but there will be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will cost a final vote later on.</v>

49
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:29.164
<v Speaker 1>And the way that works is you'll have </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these cards if you want to vote </v>

50
00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tear off the four bit.</v>

51
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.030
<v Speaker 1>If you want to bet against you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn off the against bit.</v>

52
00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:34.864
<v Speaker 1>And if you are an abstention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you slipped the entire card into a </v>

53
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.830
<v Speaker 1>ballot box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost Vladimir Putin,</v>

54
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:43.480
<v Speaker 1>esc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where method of voting.</v>

55
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to have a very proper in</v>

56
00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:48.580
<v Speaker 1>democratic result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.000
<v Speaker 1>beef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>in contrast to their IPAD apps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.620
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

60
00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:55.480
<v Speaker 1>that's the format and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of it,</v>

61
00:02:55.481 --> 00:02:56.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to explain more or less as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>go on.</v>

62
00:02:56.981 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>There is a little new twist in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence squared format,</v>

63
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>which I hope you're going to enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

64
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>which we'll come to later.</v>
