00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.443
<v Speaker 1>Square,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the hall and to tonight's </v>

2
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.990
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is b,</v>

3
00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 1>where the Dragon Africa should not look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at China.</v>

4
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.120
<v Speaker 1>We've got a distinguished panel who </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually introduce one by one as they go</v>

5
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:36.791
<v Speaker 1>up and speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a topic which has been something</v>

6
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:38.204
<v Speaker 1>which has been exercising people here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say for the last five years or </v>

7
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:42.704
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's ever more important because </v>

8
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.513
<v Speaker 1>with the European and American </v>
<v Speaker 1>economists flatlining and China's </v>

9
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:54.740
<v Speaker 1>steaming ahead and African economies </v>
<v Speaker 1>also seeming ahead.</v>

10
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.873
<v Speaker 1>The world is changing and trade between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa and China has now reached </v>

11
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.460
<v Speaker 1>$100,000,000,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I read the other day,</v>

12
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.333
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the US assistant secretary of </v>

13
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:07.394
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Carson said at some point last </v>

14
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.370
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a big problem because China was</v>

15
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:14.204
<v Speaker 1>operating in Africa with no morals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody else operating in Africa </v>

16
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.720
<v Speaker 1>whose morals I'm sure completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrupulous and always have been.</v>

17
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.990
<v Speaker 1>But that does go to the heart of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>

18
00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:27.824
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is China a model which has lifted </v>

19
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:32.354
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of its own people </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of poverty and the Guide and the </v>

20
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:41.801
<v Speaker 1>benign influence or is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforcing corruption,</v>

21
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.963
<v Speaker 1>exploitation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that will be the heart of our </v>

22
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.100
<v Speaker 1>debate tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

23
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 1>you would have been polled as you came </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

24
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.663
<v Speaker 1>whether you are a fool or against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motion and you should also have these </v>

25
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.510
<v Speaker 1>voting cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when the,</v>

26
00:01:56.511 --> 00:01:57.344
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>main species of finished and you've had </v>

27
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:01.490
<v Speaker 1>the chance to ask a few questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

28
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.710
<v Speaker 1>people will be coming around with ballot</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxes.</v>

29
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:04.544
<v Speaker 1>So we would ask you to tear the sleeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>half and vote for or against as you </v>

30
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:12.110
<v Speaker 1>wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really can't make your mind up,</v>

31
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 1>then you put a don't know which is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole slip.</v>

32
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.213
<v Speaker 1>But I hope that our panelists tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be able to sway you one way or </v>

33
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:21.374
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen is everybody's </v>

34
00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:28.160
<v Speaker 1>going to get up and make their speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>for about 10 minutes,</v>

35
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:28.994
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to ask each of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>panelists to stay there after finishing </v>

36
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:33.284
<v Speaker 1>the speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the opposing team will have some </v>

37
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.800
<v Speaker 1>quick fire questions for them.</v>
