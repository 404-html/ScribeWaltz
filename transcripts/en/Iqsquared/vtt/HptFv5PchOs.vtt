00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Can I just answer one point about doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>more for the poor?</v>

2
00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Of course we should do more for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.123
<v Speaker 1>but why do we assume that it's either </v>
<v Speaker 1>you deal with climate change or you do </v>

4
00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:12.100
<v Speaker 1>something for the poor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

5
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.053
<v Speaker 1>climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually they had most of its </v>

6
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:15.274
<v Speaker 1>effects in the developing countries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can increase double or triple the </v>

7
00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:20.440
<v Speaker 1>amount of aid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will still,</v>

8
00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>because of climate change produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>malnutrition,</v>

9
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 1>increasing hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will certainly,</v>

10
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>data produced more flooding.</v>

11
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll produce,</v>

12
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the damage to crops.</v>

13
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll produce unclean water.</v>

14
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>It'll increase dysentery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not a one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you deal with climate change,</v>

16
00:00:40.511 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a lot for the poor.</v>
