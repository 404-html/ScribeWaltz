00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.233
<v Speaker 1>I think government should do three </v>
<v Speaker 1>things because I would argue that we're </v>

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.613
<v Speaker 1>actually having a bit of a crisis right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and I just got stuck in hideous </v>

3
00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:10.540
<v Speaker 1>traffic coming across London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.300
<v Speaker 1>London has an infrastructure problem but</v>
<v Speaker 1>the web has a much,</v>

5
00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:14.980
<v Speaker 1>much bigger internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

6
00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:15.814
<v Speaker 1>It has a much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much bigger infrastructure problem if </v>

7
00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:19.780
<v Speaker 1>you like and I think the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>should focus on three things.</v>

8
00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:20.614
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have got to improve the state of our </v>

9
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:25.030
<v Speaker 1>digital infrastructure urgently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:25.031 --> 00:00:25.864
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be a rocket scientist </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see that South Korea knock it out of </v>

11
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:32.080
<v Speaker 1>the park all the time in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy and productivity,</v>

12
00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>partly because they have that superfast </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure.</v>

13
00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:35.374
<v Speaker 1>That's one big piece of the puzzle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that government can be more </v>

14
00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 1>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>

15
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.890
<v Speaker 1>we have an absolute crisis in gender on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet.</v>

16
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>

17
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.923
<v Speaker 1>enormous.</v>

18
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.330
<v Speaker 1>The percentage of women in the tech and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative industries.</v>

19
00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I saw a report just this week have gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

20
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.193
<v Speaker 1>There are now nearly doubled the </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of women in parliament that </v>

21
00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:56.680
<v Speaker 1>is probably marginally older than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tech sector double.</v>

22
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a disaster because power,</v>

23
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>product design,</v>

24
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>everything is worse and imbalanced and </v>
<v Speaker 1>asymmetrical.</v>

25
00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:06.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's the second thing where I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should intervene.</v>

26
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 1>And the third thing is that q and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>broad,</v>

27
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 1>a broad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broader skills crisis,</v>

28
00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:18.380
<v Speaker 1>which I worked on for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we still have massive issue with</v>

29
00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:19.214
<v Speaker 1>the code and the jobs that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fill and a massive issue in broader </v>

30
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.383
<v Speaker 1>digital skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone the skills of our </v>

31
00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:25.720
<v Speaker 1>establishment and parliamentarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they had three,</v>

32
00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:26.554
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tangible areas that government </v>

33
00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>could intervene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even have to touch a big tech</v>

34
00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:31.720
<v Speaker 1>company to make a big shift in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>
