00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.440
<v Speaker 1>The tragedy about Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

2
00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I say in my book,</v>

3
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.183
<v Speaker 1>is that in many ways both democratic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd prefer to say civilian government </v>

4
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.500
<v Speaker 1>and military governments have failed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop the country,</v>

5
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>have both failed to create a more just </v>
<v Speaker 1>and equitable system.</v>

6
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.593
<v Speaker 1>I mean the most successful as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic development was concerned was </v>

7
00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>admittedly a military government that </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluate.</v>

8
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.080
<v Speaker 1>But since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Musharraf seemed to be doing quite well </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that regard.</v>

10
00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:41.690
<v Speaker 1>But much of the growth under Musharraf </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned out,</v>

11
00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fairly empty,</v>

12
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:45.860
<v Speaker 1>it was a consumer boom more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>

13
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.203
<v Speaker 1>And the key reason for that is that new </v>
<v Speaker 1>government has been strong enough </v>

14
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>because the state itself is not strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to change the fundamentals of the</v>

15
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the domination of kingship,</v>

16
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.380
<v Speaker 1>the domination of what are called in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan,</v>

17
00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:04.730
<v Speaker 1>feudals the intensely conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of much of society.</v>

18
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>The lack of education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prejudice against education,</v>

19
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.790
<v Speaker 1>the lack of women's education in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

20
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.043
<v Speaker 1>the extremely high birth rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which tends to swamp every attempt to </v>

21
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:17.900
<v Speaker 1>increase services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.850
<v Speaker 1>so it's not just the civilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments have failed a military.</v>

23
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Governments have also failed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>

24
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.063
<v Speaker 1>that's on the other hand and this I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think also needs to be brought out very </v>

25
00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 1>strongly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

26
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.633
<v Speaker 1>they haven't failed completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country has stuck together or least </v>

27
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>the west of it as the east breakaway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>and I think it will continue to stick </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

29
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.233
<v Speaker 1>And after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's quite something given the </v>

30
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood in which it finds itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the internal strains that it faces</v>

31
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the Americans are keeping in power</v>

32
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:54.711
<v Speaker 2>in Pakistan is one of the most Venal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt governments.</v>

33
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:58.720
<v Speaker 2>We've had these learned nothing from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last time his gang were in bar.</v>

34
00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.923
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption really does ground that </v>

35
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:07.191
<v Speaker 2>country from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the fishes Rockman the head</v>

36
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.160
<v Speaker 2>and then it seeps downwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in order to preserve,</v>

37
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does whatever the U s asks him.</v>

38
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.863
<v Speaker 2>The big joke is whether Pakistan </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambassador to the United States who's </v>

39
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.770
<v Speaker 2>regarded as a well known us agent for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last 25 years,</v>

40
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't more appropriately be the US </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambassador to Pakistan.</v>

41
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.130
<v Speaker 2>And these are the questions people ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

42
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.103
<v Speaker 2>and talk about all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to introduce a new political </v>

43
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic culture,</v>

44
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 2>and one of the elements is that I cannot</v>
<v Speaker 2>put myself as the president,</v>

45
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.113
<v Speaker 2>so I would much prefer that I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>join the apm as a member and when the </v>

46
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 2>membership drive is there and when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>form a counsel,</v>

47
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 2>let them elect me and tell me whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want me as president,</v>

48
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 2>so therefore I'm going on the part that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I will be a member of the PML.</v>

49
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Let us see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what happens.</v>
