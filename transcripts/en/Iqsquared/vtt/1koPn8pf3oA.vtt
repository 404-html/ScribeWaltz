00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.420
<v Speaker 1>You weren't like the Segway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to go for it anyway.</v>

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that the trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign did was exactly that.</v>

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.373
<v Speaker 1>He connected with hearts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He managed to get emotion on the </v>

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>campaign trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you were at the rallies.</v>

5
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:16.404
<v Speaker 1>I was at the rallies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were noisier and they were more </v>

6
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>passionate than any other one that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>attended and I did a lot.</v>

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.123
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the left wants to get back into the </v>

8
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:27.504
<v Speaker 1>business of winning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it have to find an emotional </v>

9
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 1>message of politics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that sound like the right way or do</v>

10
00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:38.614
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or would you consider that to be a sort </v>

11
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>of a populous trap?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you.</v>

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a very important insights.</v>

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.193
<v Speaker 2>One that I share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big believer that people actually </v>

14
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 2>don't listen through their ears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They listen through their stomachs,</v>

15
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 2>and if you as a leader or reporter </v>
<v Speaker 2>connect to someone on a gut level,</v>

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 2>their usual attitude is don't bother me </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the details,</v>

17
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't connect with them on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gut level,</v>

18
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 2>you can't show them enough details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could I see that?</v>

19
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Third Point you made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one more time.</v>

20
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 2>And so what was Hillary Clinton's most </v>
<v Speaker 2>off quoted line in this campaign?</v>

21
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Visit my website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>www dot hillary clinton.</v>

22
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.620
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't connecting at the gauntlet was</v>
<v Speaker 2>visit my website and um,</v>

23
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 2>and I was making this point a friendly </v>
<v Speaker 2>on results.</v>

24
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:27.084
<v Speaker 2>Here is a brilliant writer and Leon </v>
<v Speaker 2>wieseltier wants describe Utok Rabine </v>

25
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.990
<v Speaker 2>the Israeli prime minister as a bastard </v>
<v Speaker 2>for peace.</v>

26
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.353
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what the left needs </v>

27
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:37.600
<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need a,</v>

28
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who can connect with people on a</v>

29
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 2>gut level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but take them in a progressive direction</v>

30
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 2>forward not where trump wants to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

31
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 2>which I believe is to a dark corner </v>
<v Speaker 2>backward.</v>

32
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the left needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama had some of that.</v>

33
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton had some of that.</v>

34
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.473
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

35
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see anyone on the national stage</v>

36
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 2>in America today who really has that.</v>
