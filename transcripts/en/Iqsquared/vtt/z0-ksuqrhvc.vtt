00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Dana.</v>

3
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to this intelligence squared </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>

4
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 2>It's coming to you from Cadogan Hall in </v>
<v Speaker 2>central London.</v>

5
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.730
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly 10 years ago that nine 11 </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

6
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.983
<v Speaker 2>Nearly 3000 people were killed in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks in America and they changed the </v>

7
00:00:58.431 --> 00:01:02.870
<v Speaker 2>course of world history forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George W.</v>

8
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Bush launched his war on terror in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter of weeks.</v>

9
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.973
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan was invaded in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>remove the Taliban from power who had </v>

10
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:15.860
<v Speaker 2>harbored al-Qaida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in March,</v>

11
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.590
<v Speaker 2>2003 there was the controversial war in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq.</v>

12
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.843
<v Speaker 2>The Americans set up Guantanamo Bay as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>detention center to interrogate </v>

13
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 2>terrorist suspects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The motion in our debate a decade on was</v>

14
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 2>the war on terror,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right response to nine 11 and in our</v>

15
00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:39.560
<v Speaker 2>panel we have some of the key figures </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that time purveyors,</v>

16
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Musharraf was president of parking</v>

17
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.323
<v Speaker 1>stones.</v>

18
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 2>He is arguing for the motion along with </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleen graffy,</v>

19
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 2>who served in the Bush administration.</v>

20
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.683
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

21
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.940
<v Speaker 2>Arguing against the motions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Jeremy Green Stalk,</v>

22
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 2>who was the senior British diplomat at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time</v>

23
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.913
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

24
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.670
<v Speaker 2>and the influential French politician </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor about not [inaudible].</v>

25
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.273
<v Speaker 1>Welcome.</v>

26
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Good luck to you all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now before we hear you,</v>

27
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make your opening statement,</v>

28
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.823
<v Speaker 2>it's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just very quickly run through what </v>

29
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 2>to expect in our debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you,</v>

30
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:41.150
<v Speaker 2>our audience were coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were almost to vote to see where you</v>

31
00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:46.151
<v Speaker 2>stand on the motion right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then each of our panel members will make</v>

32
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:47.144
<v Speaker 2>their opening statements to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you will have a chance to put </v>

33
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:56.240
<v Speaker 2>questions or even make comments indeed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to our panel members.</v>

34
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.433
<v Speaker 2>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will make some brief closing </v>

35
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.003
<v Speaker 2>arguments and we will ask you to vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>again to see if you've perhaps changed </v>

36
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 2>your mind and where the boat that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stands.</v>

37
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 2>So I hope that's all clear.</v>
