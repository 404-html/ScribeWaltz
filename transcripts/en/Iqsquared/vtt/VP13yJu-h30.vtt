<v Speaker 1>Welcome to today's hot topic from </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence squared.com too much free </v>

2
00:00:05.661 --> 00:00:06.494
<v Speaker 1>speech kills the massacre in Arizona </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows that the USA must learn from </v>

3
00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Europe to curb hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you agree?</v>

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.020
<v Speaker 1>The Lone gunman who mowed down Gabrielle</v>
<v Speaker 1>giffords was mentally disturbed,</v>

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.273
<v Speaker 1>but where the outcomes of his ravings </v>
<v Speaker 1>caused by the climate of political </v>

6
00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Speaker 1>hostility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Pailin,</v>

7
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.170
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had placed gunsight icons on giffords.</v>

8
00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:28.004
<v Speaker 1>Congressional district.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does this mean she shares and the </v>

9
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain?</v>

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.873
<v Speaker 1>Politician filled Willis was stripped of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his seat and his party membership for </v>

11
00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:38.374
<v Speaker 1>the kind of polarizing language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an everyday occurrence in the </v>

12
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:43.750
<v Speaker 1>USA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who has got it right?</v>

13
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.003
<v Speaker 1>Does liberal democracy need you to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thick skin or does it need a strong </v>

14
00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>state protecting us from extreme verbal </v>
<v Speaker 1>assault?</v>

15
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.353
<v Speaker 1>Here are some highlights from Wendy </v>
<v Speaker 1>kaminer confronting femi ought to Taji </v>

16
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.433
<v Speaker 1>as they thrash it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We start with femi defending curbs on </v>

17
00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:00.034
<v Speaker 1>hate speech.</v>

18
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Less hate speech will be bread and so we</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have less to fear.</v>

19
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.303
<v Speaker 2>I hate speech can certainly be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributing factor to bigotry and </v>

20
00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 2>prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

21
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a,</v>

22
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not here defending the merits of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate speech,</v>

23
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.700
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

24
00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

25
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it is always much more dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I also think that it's morally wrong</v>

26
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.073
<v Speaker 2>to criminalize speech that we don't like</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we have some sense that in the </v>

27
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 2>long run it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be,</v>

28
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:40.244
<v Speaker 2>it's going to cause decide or harm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>English should be given the right to </v>

29
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:47.750
<v Speaker 2>speak yes to the point where it violates</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rights of others.</v>

30
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.230
<v Speaker 2>People may be given the right to express</v>
<v Speaker 2>their concerns about principles,</v>

31
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 2>but not about individual characteristics</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>

32
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.483
<v Speaker 2>I personally am grateful and proud to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in a country and to be part of a </v>

33
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:04.214
<v Speaker 2>nation that does not tolerate hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speech is anything I'd say that perhaps </v>

34
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:10.394
<v Speaker 2>our restrictions and keeps me in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've go far enough if I can take this </v>

35
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to respond quickly to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things that family said first.</v>

36
00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:18.154
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really appreciate her forthrightness </v>

37
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.900
<v Speaker 2>in questioning why we need to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech,</v>

38
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 2>because that's not a statement that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>will generally hear from people in the u</v>

39
00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:31.970
<v Speaker 2>s to defend hate speech regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because here,</v>

40
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really so acceptable to say,</v>

41
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:36.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in free speech.</v>
