1
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.743
<v Speaker 1>Square,</v>

2
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.223
<v Speaker 2>I think the lesson we can draw from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hannah's list of forthcoming debates is </v>

3
00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:21.134
<v Speaker 2>that contentiousness is what sells and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so I hope that we're going to follow in </v>

4
00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:26.234
<v Speaker 2>the footsteps of Christopher hitchens </v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight and know who the panel is going </v>

5
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:29.144
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very contentious indeed because this is </v>

6
00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:35.810
<v Speaker 2>a debate which could not be more timely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was jumped up by intelligence squared</v>

7
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.673
<v Speaker 2>earlier in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course last week saw the launch </v>

8
00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:40.034
<v Speaker 2>of the intergenerational foundation </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is there to campaign for equality </v>

9
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:44.804
<v Speaker 2>between generations and their stance is </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically that indeed the baby boomers </v>

10
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:49.664
<v Speaker 2>have stared in the family silver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to mention taken all the houses and </v>

11
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:55.580
<v Speaker 2>ought to get out of there as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible to make way for the young.</v>

12
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.010
<v Speaker 2>And it's also notable that the occupy </v>
<v Speaker 2>London demonstrations are basically,</v>

13
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.133
<v Speaker 2>although they are partly about class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are also very largely about </v>

14
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.853
<v Speaker 2>generational inequality and we all know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the basic framework of this </v>

15
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:11.630
<v Speaker 2>argument is about.</v>

16
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.913
<v Speaker 2>It's undoubtedly true that there are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great many people from the baby boomer </v>

17
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:19.280
<v Speaker 2>generation who benefited from every good</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that life had to offer.</v>

18
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.940
<v Speaker 2>They not only had sex before the age of </v>
<v Speaker 2>aids,</v>

19
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 2>but they also got the houses which were </v>
<v Speaker 2>very cheap.</v>

20
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.613
<v Speaker 2>They got the free university educations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they've ended up with a great deal </v>

21
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:36.380
<v Speaker 2>of wealth in the houses and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>expecting fantastic pensions and they're</v>

22
00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:37.214
<v Speaker 2>still expecting the young to pay and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>young men are growing up in an entirely </v>

23
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:40.484
<v Speaker 2>different universe in which it's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer possible for ordinary people to </v>

24
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:44.024
<v Speaker 2>buy houses in their twenties in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are our new secure jobs with final </v>

25
00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:48.494
<v Speaker 2>salary pensions any longer and in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been told that they have to pay </v>

26
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:53.770
<v Speaker 2>many thousands of pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their university educations.</v>

27
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.993
<v Speaker 2>So some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems on the face of it completely </v>

28
00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:59.750
<v Speaker 2>obvious that this is unfair and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>something has to be done.</v>

29
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.303
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got a very distinguished panel </v>

30
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:03.584
<v Speaker 2>here tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just before I introduced them all </v>

31
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:06.680
<v Speaker 2>and I just want to remind you or how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate operates.</v>

32
00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:07.514
<v Speaker 2>You will have voted before you came in </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the hole and when all the speeches </v>

33
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Speaker 2>have been made and the questions from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the floor have been heard,</v>

34
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.253
<v Speaker 2>then the panel are going to make some </v>
<v Speaker 2>closing speeches and while they do say </v>

35
00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:18.314
<v Speaker 2>we would like you to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what was fascinating about these </v>

36
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:24.380
<v Speaker 2>debates to see whether at all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>panelists managed to change your mind.</v>

37
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.903
<v Speaker 2>So while that's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you post in the box which will be </v>

38
00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:31.130
<v Speaker 2>coming round?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either tear,</v>

39
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.353
<v Speaker 2>tear this apart and post either you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>for or against card into the box or if </v>

40
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:36.584
<v Speaker 2>you're undecided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>post the entire thing and if anyone </v>

41
00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:41.870
<v Speaker 2>would like to tweet about this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going on.</v>

42
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Then the tweet Hashtag is Iq to silver </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'd be glad you did.</v>

43
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.050
<v Speaker 2>Now I've handled tonight is David </v>
<v Speaker 2>Willetts,</v>

44
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:55.930
<v Speaker 2>the minister of state for universities </v>
<v Speaker 2>in science and he wrote a very forced,</v>

45
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 2>a book full of foresight and insight so </v>
<v Speaker 2>called of pinch.</v>

46
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.304
<v Speaker 2>How the baby boomers took their </v>
<v Speaker 2>children's future and why they should </v>

47
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:02.914
<v Speaker 2>give it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as we were debating just before we </v>

48
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:05.824
<v Speaker 2>came on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating that the man who wrote </v>

49
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 2>such a book should now be in a position </v>
<v Speaker 2>to interrogate the university's minister</v>

50
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.530
<v Speaker 2>about why he is so raised tuition fees </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the motion.</v>

51
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have Ed Halco who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>associate editor of the spectator,</v>

52
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 2>and it's quite curious that he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the motion because he too is the</v>

53
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 2>author of a book on this problem called </v>
<v Speaker 2>jilted generation.</v>

54
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.394
<v Speaker 2>How Britain bankrupted it's youth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then speaking with David for the motion </v>

55
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 2>is Laurie Penny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spokesman for the younger generation and</v>

56
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 2>journalist for the Guardian and the New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Statesman and against the motion.</v>

57
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 2>We have frank for Rady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professor of sociology at the University</v>

58
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:42.723
<v Speaker 2>of Kent and his books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His many books include paranoid </v>

59
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:45.184
<v Speaker 2>parenting.</v>
