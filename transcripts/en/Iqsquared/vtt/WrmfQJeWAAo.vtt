1
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.433
<v Speaker 1>Should we actually be having in our mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of promoting democracy and not </v>

2
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.440
<v Speaker 1>necessarily by offering false promises </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the people,</v>

3
00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 1>but by taking on those who are thwarting</v>
<v Speaker 1>it or should or is it,</v>

4
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.613
<v Speaker 1>is it appropriate for us instead to </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on very important point of </v>

5
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.760
<v Speaker 1>securing oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping friendly with those who can give</v>

6
00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>the oil on which our economy depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

7
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.180
<v Speaker 1>have we got our ideals in the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>order?</v>

8
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.403
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a position on whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should actually possibly jeopardize </v>

9
00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:57.730
<v Speaker 1>our economic health in favor of the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pushing the democracy notion?</v>

10
00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.430
<v Speaker 2>This is a really good question because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it shows what the whole problem,</v>

12
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 2>the whole problem is that we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>created a black and white world in which</v>

13
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:11.121
<v Speaker 2>we imagined that we have to choose all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time either by being Dick Cheney and</v>

14
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:12.114
<v Speaker 2>focused on oil and oppression and </v>
<v Speaker 2>plotting up desk bots or on the other </v>

15
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:16.494
<v Speaker 2>hand Amnesty International with </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely no contact with the world at </v>

16
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not,</v>

17
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 2>this is not the choice that we face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not what our diplomats are there</v>

18
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what our international policy</v>

19
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:31.494
<v Speaker 2>is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to discover how to be </v>

20
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 2>pragmatically moral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to be passionately moderate,</v>

21
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.663
<v Speaker 2>how to combine our moral instincts with </v>
<v Speaker 2>our interests and being realistic about </v>

22
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:43.464
<v Speaker 2>what we can and can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason we let people down all the </v>

23
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason we invade these countries and</v>

24
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:49.260
<v Speaker 2>create a mess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason we're probably going to do it</v>

25
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:50.094
<v Speaker 2>again for the next 15 years is we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>never managed to get a mature </v>

26
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:54.114
<v Speaker 2>conversation going about what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually doing and what we can do in </v>

27
00:01:57.841 --> 00:01:58.674
<v Speaker 2>these countries were not able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand firstly that these countries </v>

28
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:02.964
<v Speaker 2>are not our countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that these countries do have a claim of </v>

29
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 2>sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have their own cultures,</v>

30
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:10.584
<v Speaker 2>their own languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't really like foreigners </v>

31
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 2>being in them and that therefore what we</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with other people's countries,</v>

32
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:17.364
<v Speaker 2>a bit like what I would do with you if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were my friend has to be limited by </v>

33
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 2>respect for other people's autonomy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people's choice and cannot involve</v>

34
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 2>an endless oscillation between black and</v>
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>

35
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Assuming that the only choices we face </v>
<v Speaker 2>are either oil,</v>

36
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most pure conception of our in moral</v>

37
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:36.534
<v Speaker 2>GC.</v>
