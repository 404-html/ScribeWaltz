00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.153
<v Speaker 1>I know we only still sort of the house </v>
<v Speaker 1>were absolutely in favor of character </v>

2
00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:04.024
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am slightly worried at the moment </v>

3
00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:06.394
<v Speaker 1>of some of the some of the noise I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing about perhaps grading character </v>

4
00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:10.084
<v Speaker 1>or assessing character and using </v>
<v Speaker 1>character education as the means of </v>

5
00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:15.760
<v Speaker 1>assessing pupils and most are absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>in favor of teaching character.</v>

6
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.803
<v Speaker 1>The measurement of parents when it's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>its infancy and one of the main </v>

7
00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:20.584
<v Speaker 1>researchers in this field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angela Duckworth has said that such </v>

8
00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:26.770
<v Speaker 1>measurements are not ready for any </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious kind of high stakes to use.</v>

9
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.963
<v Speaker 1>If we did end up grading pupils on </v>
<v Speaker 1>character and using such great for </v>

10
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.000
<v Speaker 1>anything significant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I guarantee you that it will become</v>

11
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.923
<v Speaker 1>effectively another middle class ramp </v>
<v Speaker 1>away for the underachieving children of </v>

12
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>middle class professionals to gain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system in their favor.</v>

13
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>If we get rid of tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will inevitably end up depending more</v>

14
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.603
<v Speaker 1>on assessment which disadvantages the </v>
<v Speaker 1>already disadvantaged and reinforces </v>

15
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.680
<v Speaker 1>prevailing stereotypes.</v>

16
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the not too recent past,</v>

17
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.690
<v Speaker 1>these patterns were much better </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood than they are today.</v>

18
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.763
<v Speaker 1>In the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the civil service reform was Charles </v>

19
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.133
<v Speaker 1>Northcote and Stafford Trevelyan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For so long battle to make entry to the </v>

20
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.843
<v Speaker 1>Civil Service based on merit rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>family connections in the early 20th </v>

21
00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:07.594
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pioneering Labor education is such as </v>

22
00:01:09.191 --> 00:01:10.024
<v Speaker 1>our external who trusts you mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Beatrice and Sydney web for an </v>

23
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.843
<v Speaker 1>education system based around exams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rh Tony didn't just believe as truth </v>

24
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.140
<v Speaker 1>remotely said in the amounts of Patriot </v>
<v Speaker 1>power of education.</v>

25
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.063
<v Speaker 1>He believed in the emancipator he power </v>
<v Speaker 1>of exams because he thought the only </v>

26
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>exams could ensure that underprivileged </v>
<v Speaker 1>children were treated fairly.</v>

27
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Only exams could counter entrenched </v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege.</v>

28
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Very little has changed since then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anything,</v>

29
00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:34.330
<v Speaker 1>we have more research to back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony's.</v>

30
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 1>exams are still the Ferris means of </v>
<v Speaker 1>assessment.</v>

32
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 1>And if you care about meritocracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social mobility and fairness,</v>

33
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.520
<v Speaker 1>then you must be in favor of them.</v>
