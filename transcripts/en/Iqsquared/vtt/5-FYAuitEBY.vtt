1
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is imperfect.</v>

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is Westminster so's Whitehall.</v>

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.963
<v Speaker 1>So our political institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent five years as deputy prime </v>

4
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>minister in White Hall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of that,</v>

5
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I came out more antiestablishment than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>went in</v>

6
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>because I saw a poll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still am by the secrecy,</v>

7
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:22.404
<v Speaker 1>the overcentralisation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the of course I say this is a Liberal </v>

8
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Democrat and they lopsided and </v>
<v Speaker 1>undemocratic electoral system.</v>

9
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>We have all of those things I think are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rubbish.</v>

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>It's imperfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to change.</v>

11
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:34.554
<v Speaker 1>But guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say in response to the </v>

12
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:38.700
<v Speaker 1>imperfections in our own political </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>we're going to raise the whole lot to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground and walk off.</v>

14
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>You don't do that in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you?</v>

15
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>When something is imperfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you recognize,</v>

16
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>you try and make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You work with others to do so.</v>

17
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.793
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that you can sort of wash </v>
<v Speaker 1>your hands of it because you don't like </v>

18
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.960
<v Speaker 1>its imperfections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn your back on it.</v>

19
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Pull the drawbridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish it away.</v>

20
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that is a practical,</v>

21
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>response to the realities of the complex</v>

22
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:05.754
<v Speaker 1>and interdependent world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the complex and interdependent </v>

23
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 1>European Union and the complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions that govern it,</v>

24
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>that we have here today.</v>
