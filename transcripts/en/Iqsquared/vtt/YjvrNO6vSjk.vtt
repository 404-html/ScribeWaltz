00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.203
<v Speaker 1>I would suggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wonder whether you agree that one </v>

2
00:00:03.371 --> 00:00:04.204
<v Speaker 1>thing we can do is actually live up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideals that we profess to live by </v>

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.220
<v Speaker 1>and that we professed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these countries also should live by</v>

4
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.323
<v Speaker 1>and just to take an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of our engagement and the </v>

5
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.423
<v Speaker 1>Arabian peninsula over the last hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>years is a history of promising freedom </v>

6
00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.064
<v Speaker 1>and democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in fact doing everything to make </v>

7
00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:28.174
<v Speaker 1>sure that they could never possibly work</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we always put the interests of </v>

8
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.283
<v Speaker 1>commercial convenience above the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest of those ideals and we </v>

9
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:39.874
<v Speaker 1>continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pledged to do so in that we allow BA </v>

10
00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:45.064
<v Speaker 1>systems or bp or our dependence on oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>to come before actually supporting </v>

11
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Republican nationalist secular </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments in the Middle East and we've</v>

12
00:00:58.601 --> 00:00:59.434
<v Speaker 1>always been terrified of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So isn't there much more we can do than </v>

13
00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:06.070
<v Speaker 1>just have better chats on the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't we actually be true to our ideals?</v>

14
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.923
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can do much better to be true to our </v>

15
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:19.571
<v Speaker 2>ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

16
00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:20.404
<v Speaker 2>the history of Britain's involvement in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East since the first world </v>

17
00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:24.784
<v Speaker 2>war is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is shameful what we did after the </v>

18
00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:27.604
<v Speaker 2>collapse of the Ottoman Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way we connived with the Syrian </v>

19
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.473
<v Speaker 2>French colony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way we created a colony in Iraq was </v>

20
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:36.370
<v Speaker 2>shameful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

21
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:40.480
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but and this is another thing,</v>

22
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 2>let's not be so carried away with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>illusory nature of what we are.</v>

23
00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Our allies are or can be into the bigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>danger,</v>

24
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 2>which is that we talk so much about our </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideals.</v>

25
00:01:54.101 --> 00:01:54.934
<v Speaker 2>We lived the dream of our principals so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much that we raised the expectation of </v>

26
00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:02.320
<v Speaker 2>people in other countries in ways that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were unable to fulfill.</v>

27
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.980
<v Speaker 2>Probably the thing that actually hits me</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardest about Iraq</v>

28
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.100
<v Speaker 2>was that our presence there on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and my experience than me son,</v>

29
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.500
<v Speaker 2>is that the more I talked about human </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>

30
00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:15.334
<v Speaker 2>the more I talked about our principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more encouraged people to come </v>

31
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:19.024
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haida who worked with me as my </v>

32
00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:22.630
<v Speaker 2>translator or women who joined our </v>
<v Speaker 2>provincial council,</v>

33
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.273
<v Speaker 2>who would subsequently killed by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>militia and who we've done absolutely </v>

34
00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:31.444
<v Speaker 2>nothing to protect or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or to get out of the country because we </v>

35
00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:37.450
<v Speaker 2>did what we couldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We exceeded our resources,</v>

36
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:38.284
<v Speaker 2>we made promises we couldn't fulfill and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we raised expectations which we were </v>

37
00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:46.300
<v Speaker 2>unable to do anything about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's almost the crueler the</v>

38
00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:47.134
<v Speaker 2>trail.</v>
