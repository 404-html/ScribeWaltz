00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Philosophers love the burning building </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario,</v>

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>so you've got two rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the building is burning and you can save</v>

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>either the thing in one room or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in the other,</v>

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.263
<v Speaker 1>and that's the choice that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine there's a child in one room </v>

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>and there's a Picasso in the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The building is burning.</v>

6
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.223
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effective altruist could argue that </v>

7
00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:31.591
<v Speaker 1>you can sell up a casio for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions and with those millions,</v>

8
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.630
<v Speaker 1>give that money to charity to a malaria </v>
<v Speaker 1>net charity,</v>

9
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>which will then save a great many on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost benefit analysis will say,</v>

10
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.610
<v Speaker 1>have a great many more children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

11
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.623
<v Speaker 1>so the effective altruism faced with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning Picasso and a burning child </v>

12
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>might save the Burning Picasso.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this point,</v>

13
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.013
<v Speaker 1>my sympathy for effective altruists just</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappears and it disappears because I </v>

14
00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:05.530
<v Speaker 1>think there really is something that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not factored in here,</v>

15
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.180
<v Speaker 1>which is the emotional sympathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely essential,</v>

16
00:01:10.181 --> 00:01:15.181
<v Speaker 1>which you have done everything you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>to eliminate from our calculations,</v>

17
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.370
<v Speaker 1>but I would call the person and when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree about this,</v>

18
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think the technical term for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person that saves the Picasso,</v>

19
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.410
<v Speaker 1>and I think this would be a sort of.</v>

20
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.960
<v Speaker 1>I think publicly I would get a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>support for this.</v>

21
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.883
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but out there that the technical term </v>

22
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.973
<v Speaker 1>for the person that saves the Picasso </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the burning child is a heartless </v>

23
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:33.934
<v Speaker 1>bastard.</v>
