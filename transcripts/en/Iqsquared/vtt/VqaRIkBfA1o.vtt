1
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Regarding intervention or the West </v>
<v Speaker 1>should do.</v>

2
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.180
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3
00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:12.014
<v Speaker 1>I'm in an ideal situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would agree that a humanitarian corey </v>

4
00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:16.310
<v Speaker 1>doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe zones,</v>

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you name it,</v>

6
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.950
<v Speaker 1>no fly zones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>

7
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:19.784
<v Speaker 1>but it's never going to happen and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>never going to happen because I think </v>

8
00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.290
<v Speaker 1>has reached the conclusion that a choice</v>
<v Speaker 1>to topple Michelle said,</v>

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.010
<v Speaker 1>then let's be quite clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

11
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.530
<v Speaker 1>if the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>NATO gets involved,</v>

12
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I think the regime will crumble very </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly,</v>

13
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.793
<v Speaker 1>but a quick crumbling of the regime or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the collapse of the regime will </v>

14
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:40.664
<v Speaker 1>inevitably lead to a prolonged the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lebanon style civil war because </v>

15
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.460
<v Speaker 1>potentially the partition of Syria and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very real prospect by the way.</v>

16
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.833
<v Speaker 1>So should we interpret you saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as meaning that your urging us to be </v>

17
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>careful what we wish for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a way,</v>

18
00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>you're saying that if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the regime collapses,</v>

19
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not wholly a good thing.</v>

20
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.733
<v Speaker 1>Well to be a realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in regime collapse a look that the </v>

21
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>region probably has probably about 2 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million hardcore supporters.</v>

22
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being very realistic and very honest</v>

23
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:11.350
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

24
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.193
<v Speaker 1>Jim does have those people and those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Gaddafi didn't have 2 million </v>

25
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hardcore sport is not robotic,</v>

26
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.083
<v Speaker 1>but by Sharon does and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary reason why he's still in power </v>

27
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>and those 2 million people are simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go away.</v>

28
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>They're going to stay in Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably going to fight,</v>

29
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.273
<v Speaker 1>they're going to reinforce their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas and they're probably going to </v>

30
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>fight against the central government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever takes control in Damascus.</v>

31
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to be realistic about this.</v>

32
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>What can be done immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the West can perhaps through the</v>

33
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Qataris and the Saudis for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can support local military councils</v>

34
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:45.864
<v Speaker 1>and they are being set up to organize </v>
<v Speaker 1>the free Syrian army on a local level </v>

35
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>and they can spot those people.</v>

36
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Problem is the Jordanians and the Turks </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't allow a arms in,</v>

37
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>don't even allow humanitarian aid </v>
<v Speaker 1>through their border.</v>

38
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is a big,</v>

39
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>big logistical problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

40
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>you can pay FSA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight salaries,</v>

41
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.250
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't say,</v>

42
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:06.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

43
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.880
<v Speaker 1>that's going to help you need weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So particular type of.</v>

44
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're good.</v>

45
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Come to the JC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

46
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.423
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proposal you would support is the </v>

47
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 1>same as Roger Korean's arming the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition?</v>

48
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:17.864
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>

49
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.733
<v Speaker 1>as long as she believes that he can win </v>
<v Speaker 1>militarily and at the moment he does </v>

50
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:26.630
<v Speaker 1>believe he can win militarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there will be no political solution</v>

51
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:28.850
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately there has to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political solution.</v>

52
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.020
<v Speaker 1>There can be no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no other,</v>

53
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.480
<v Speaker 1>no other solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's about forcing by.</v>

54
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Charlotte said to sit on the negotiating</v>
<v Speaker 1>table and he'll only do that if he faces</v>

55
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:37.244
<v Speaker 1>and armed opposition that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously fight him at least to a </v>

56
00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>stalemate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
