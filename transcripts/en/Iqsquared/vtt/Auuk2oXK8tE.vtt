1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.210
<v Speaker 1>There's been this enormous increase in </v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality and that it has multiple,</v>

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.230
<v Speaker 1>multiple dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more money at the top,</v>

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning,</v>

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

7
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Reagan when Reagan in 1980,</v>

8
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>he started pushing for the kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes in economic policy.</v>

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

10
00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:29.644
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an awareness that those </v>

11
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>policies would lead to more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more inequality.</v>

12
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea was that,</v>

13
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lower tax rates at the top and you,</v>

14
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.083
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free up the economy and deregulate and </v>

15
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>the hope was the idea was that it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

16
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>there'll be more inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the size of the pie would increase.</v>

17
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.813
<v Speaker 1>So much so that everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even those in the middle of the bottom </v>

18
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.394
<v Speaker 1>would be better off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would get a bigger piece even if </v>

19
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>they got a smaller share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>we've had a third of a century now of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this experiment</v>

21
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>and we can see the outcome.</v>

22
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.073
<v Speaker 1>They were right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would include increased </v>

23
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.133
<v Speaker 1>inequality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sheer going to the top 1% has </v>

24
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:31.790
<v Speaker 1>gone to numbers between 20 and 25%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

25
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two fold increase in the share,</v>

26
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:35.664
<v Speaker 1>going to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one 10th of 1% has increased three to </v>

27
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>four fold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But unfortunately,</v>

28
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:42.894
<v Speaker 1>this idea of trickle down economics that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody would benefit is absolutely </v>

29
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:46.824
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does actually happen is median </v>

30
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:56.211
<v Speaker 1>income make I'm in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has stagnated income at the bottom.</v>

31
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>You saved him worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the middle income today,</v>

32
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:02.844
<v Speaker 1>the median income of a in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States adjusted for inflation is lower </v>

33
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>than it was a quarter of a century ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the bottom,</v>

34
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.070
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage has not increased for </v>
<v Speaker 1>45 years.</v>

35
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.120
<v Speaker 1>So I think then an economic system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't increase standards of living for</v>

36
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:24.774
<v Speaker 1>a majority of its citizens over a period</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a quarter century end of the bottom </v>

37
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>has people worse off than they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 50 years ago is a failed economic</v>

38
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

39
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Ah.</v>
