00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.273
<v Speaker 1>That cannot be stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole debate and we'll always be </v>

2
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>colored by what we choose to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In truth,</v>

3
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.860
<v Speaker 1>not to see if</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cannot talk seriously.</v>

4
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not 1989 anymore.</v>

5
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I wonder whether when they say I'll pray</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>

6
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.823
<v Speaker 1>he gives that wonderful reply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll think for you was looking forward </v>

7
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.543
<v Speaker 1>to Mary Beard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking out for Berlusconi and Boris </v>

8
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:10.161
<v Speaker 1>here making the case for series a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We run the unselfish or wearing a hat.</v>

9
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.433
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this shouldn't just be a yes or </v>

10
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>no swipe and the shit that made me </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter so he decides.</v>

11
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I think we can raise the bar from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't pick it.</v>

12
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Just a matter of communication and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people as well and looking for it and</v>

13
00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>an old tiny our creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our humanism,</v>

14
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I doubt very much</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you like it or not,</v>

15
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 1>the Internet is going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to join us.</v>

16
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>We should be calling an end to the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>on drugs.</v>

17
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:13.281
<v Speaker 1>What we need to read Spanish society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course hip hop enhanced the society.</v>

18
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Democracy is not always the best form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

19
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.453
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama is ultimately an American </v>
<v Speaker 1>Patriot Catholic Church and is a force </v>

20
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>for good in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you getting the message?</v>

21
00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>There is a reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they matter.</v>
