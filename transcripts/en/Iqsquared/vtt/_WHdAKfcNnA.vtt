00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Dirty joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Ernst,</v>

2
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.203
<v Speaker 1>Lubitsch masterpiece Ninotchka the hero </v>
<v Speaker 1>visits a cafeteria and orders coffee </v>

3
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.213
<v Speaker 1>without cream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here is the wonderful lip reply of </v>

4
00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:32.020
<v Speaker 1>the waiter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

5
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.350
<v Speaker 1>we have run out of cream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only have milk.</v>

6
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Can I then bring you coffee without </v>
<v Speaker 1>milk?</v>

7
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's absolutely a correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

8
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.133
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coffee without cream or coffee without </v>

9
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 1>milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you don't get,</v>

10
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.690
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the identity of what you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in what sense?</v>

11
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Because if you bring this logic to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme,</v>

12
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you can also see how a double negation </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't have just when you do not</v>

13
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.520
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

14
00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:13.060
<v Speaker 1>coffee without cream or milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result is not zero,</v>

15
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.163
<v Speaker 1>but what another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My last example from popular culture </v>

16
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.850
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's from early nineties,</v>

17
00:01:21.851 --> 00:01:22.684
<v Speaker 1>you remember the movie with Ethan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcgregor before he became a trader when </v>

18
00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 1>he was still playing a working class.</v>

19
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Guys brassed off the hero accompanies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took her home after their date.</v>

20
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.270
<v Speaker 1>A young pretty woman who at the entrance</v>
<v Speaker 1>to her flat tells Kim,</v>

21
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>would you like to come in for a coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He answers there is a problem.</v>

22
00:01:45.851 --> 00:01:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink,</v>

23
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.870
<v Speaker 1>drink coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She retorts with a smile.</v>

24
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.670
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any.</v>

25
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.150
<v Speaker 1>What I like is that you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get through this.</v>

26
00:01:55.151 --> 00:02:00.151
<v Speaker 1>Double negation is probably the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not vulgar,</v>

27
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:04.690
<v Speaker 1>but open erotic invitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's my point.</v>

28
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.793
<v Speaker 1>I invite you for a coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I negate coffee and the result is </v>

29
00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:13.480
<v Speaker 1>not zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result is beautiful invitation.</v>
