<v Speaker 1>Sister wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide his speeches.</v>

2
00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>I think he talks a lot about how you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>but he's all terribly dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.870
<v Speaker 1>it's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>you start here and you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

6
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>and then you had to end with a pair of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rod here.</v>

7
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be a girl speaking from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>

9
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I think the only way to do this is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say what I think.</v>

10
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.750
<v Speaker 1>And Boris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>he's really trained in classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric.</v>

12
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.553
<v Speaker 1>That's all he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think one way you can undermine </v>

13
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:32.334
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those high level rhetoricians is just </v>

14
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:36.174
<v Speaker 1>going for the juggler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I shall try to go for the drug </v>

15
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:39.114
<v Speaker 1>dealer.</v>
