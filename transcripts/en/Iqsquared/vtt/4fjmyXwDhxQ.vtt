00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Now you have a statistic in my book </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I mentioned that it was the </v>

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.304
<v Speaker 1>average income of the parents of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>value university undergrad students </v>

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.183
<v Speaker 1>right now corresponds to the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>income of the top two percent of the US </v>

4
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:17.154
<v Speaker 1>distribution of family income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this doesn't mean that everybody at </v>

5
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.500
<v Speaker 1>outcomes from the two percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have some people who come from below</v>

6
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.373
<v Speaker 1>youtube too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are so few and so people who </v>

7
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.383
<v Speaker 1>come from the top two are so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>overall average is as if all students </v>

8
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>had been picked up from them within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top two.</v>

9
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.383
<v Speaker 1>I think this is an example where the gap</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the official discourse based on </v>

10
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:46.191
<v Speaker 1>meritocracy call opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mobility of us society,</v>

11
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

12
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.043
<v Speaker 1>And the reality is particularly strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's a lot of fight crazy </v>

13
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>basie elite not only in the US but also </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my country in France.</v>

14
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.163
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have this very high tuition </v>

15
00:00:59.101 --> 00:00:59.934
<v Speaker 1>fees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are sometimes able to put the </v>

16
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.693
<v Speaker 1>five times more public resources in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools where the children of the elite </v>

17
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>go to as compared to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

18
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:13.611
<v Speaker 1>in every country there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypocrisy about equal opportunity and an</v>

19
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:20.031
<v Speaker 1>incredible abilities and time of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite to justify inequality as fair when</v>

20
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.433
<v Speaker 1>it is not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think what's important is to put </v>

21
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:29.410
<v Speaker 1>all these claims under public scrutiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to have more transparency,</v>

22
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.413
<v Speaker 1>not only about income and wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also about who benefits from what </v>

23
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.740
<v Speaker 1>public spendings so that we can adapt </v>
<v Speaker 1>our policies.</v>
