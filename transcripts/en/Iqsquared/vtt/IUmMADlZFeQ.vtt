<v Speaker 2>future of Afghanistan and what the West </v>

5
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:26.471
<v Speaker 2>more dangerous situation in Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>born in the trauma of the petitioner,</v>

6
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:27.524
<v Speaker 2>British colonial India in 1947.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan has since then struggled to </v>

7
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:32.354
<v Speaker 2>match what many Pakistan is regard as </v>
<v Speaker 2>its enemy India only in the possession </v>

<v Speaker 2>of nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Pakistan claim parity?</v>

<v Speaker 2>often been interrupted by military rule </v>
<v Speaker 2>and half the country was torn away when </v>

11
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:50.750
<v Speaker 2>because of India's military </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention.</v>

<v Speaker 2>state of Bangladesh.</v>
