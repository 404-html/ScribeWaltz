00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.600
<v Speaker 2>say something about your relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your father when there was not much</v>

3
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 2>of a relationship because he was always </v>
<v Speaker 2>absent.</v>

4
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 2>My parents divorced very early on and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

5
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 2>he lived in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a world of after the collapse of,</v>

6
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 2>of Germany and the destruction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>

7
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 2>He fled into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>

8
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

9
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.093
<v Speaker 2>his kingdom of fantasies and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasized about writing a universal </v>

10
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:50.064
<v Speaker 2>study and he had to study a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually studied biology and history </v>

11
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:59.571
<v Speaker 2>and psychology and he spoke eight or </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine languages including Japanese and he</v>

12
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:00.864
<v Speaker 2>refused to work and he refused to earn </v>
<v Speaker 2>money because he was working on the </v>

13
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:06.654
<v Speaker 2>study in his wife's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always had his women always had to earn </v>

14
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:12.324
<v Speaker 2>money and race of children and cook the </v>
<v Speaker 2>food and he was resting and taking </v>

15
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 2>notes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never wrote one page.</v>

16
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 2>What influence did it never wrote?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One page.</v>

17
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.363
<v Speaker 2>I also know that the Dalai Lama told you</v>
<v Speaker 2>that every person is at the center of </v>

18
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:34.071
<v Speaker 2>their own universe and you replied</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to add.</v>

19
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

20
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 2>in that definition I would be the center</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the university laughs.</v>

21
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:42.554
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you would be the center of the </v>

22
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and youth said,</v>

23
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without missing a beat,</v>

24
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your holiness,</v>

25
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:54.471
<v Speaker 2>please don't tell that to my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the way,</v>

26
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:57.340
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people always a,</v>

27
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.600
<v Speaker 2>it starts out that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 2>we are talking about some obsessions now</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than any obsessions or anything.</v>

29
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 2>There's humane may films including even </v>
<v Speaker 2>to our,</v>

30
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:08.964
<v Speaker 2>started small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a very dark sort of humane in </v>

31
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 2>the bad lieutenant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Audiences laugh more than in a,</v>

32
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 2>in a fred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Murphy comedy.</v>

33
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 2>They laugh from the first til the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>

34
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.040
<v Speaker 2>And this is wonderful to see that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally accept my kind of humor.</v>

35
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 2>And I really liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're pretty funny.</v>

36
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.733
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

37
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How should I say?</v>

38
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.563
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly have humane and it should </v>

39
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 2>not be overlooked.</v>
