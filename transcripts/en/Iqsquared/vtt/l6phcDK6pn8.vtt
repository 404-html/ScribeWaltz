00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Cori,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about you,</v>

2
00:00:01.131 --> 00:00:01.964
<v Speaker 1>do you think it could have evolved in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely different way and retain some </v>

3
00:00:05.601 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>of that openness and sense of boundless </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom there?</v>

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5
00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:11.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a historical determinists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yes,</v>

6
00:00:11.931 --> 00:00:12.764
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of different things could have </v>

7
00:00:13.671 --> 00:00:14.420
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean I believe in the adjacent </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible so people have ideas for things</v>

9
00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:22.160
<v Speaker 1>like airplanes at periodic intervals </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the whole of human history.</v>

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.233
<v Speaker 1>But eventually some of those ideas get </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized because we have material </v>

11
00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>science and physics to kind of catch up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

12
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.273
<v Speaker 1>which is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people say you get railroads when </v>

13
00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:30.554
<v Speaker 1>it's railroading time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't mean that there's a mystical </v>

14
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 1>railroading energy in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just mean that we have now attained</v>

15
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>the point where when that idea occurs </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it's on scheduled regularity,</v>

16
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.070
<v Speaker 1>that's some of the people to whom it </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurs will be able to figure out how to</v>

17
00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:43.880
<v Speaker 1>make it a reality.</v>

18
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.713
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think we run on rails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have lots of moments in our </v>

19
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:50.780
<v Speaker 1>history where things have gone well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere they've gone poorly.</v>

20
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.320
<v Speaker 1>When the robot web consortium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.350
<v Speaker 1>decided that members who participated in</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard setting would have to have your</v>

22
00:00:57.351 --> 00:00:58.184
<v Speaker 1>web patents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there would be no tollgates for </v>

23
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:03.110
<v Speaker 1>producing web technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a key juncture.</v>

24
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I could have gone a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have been much worse.</v>

25
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.603
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Digital Millennium Copyright </v>

26
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.813
<v Speaker 1>Act was passed in 98,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when the European Union copyright </v>

27
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>directive was passed in 2001,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of them produce extraordinarily bad</v>

28
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:23.351
<v Speaker 1>policy that if we hadn't had it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think things would be much better.</v>

29
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:25.520
<v Speaker 1>They both provide for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among other things,</v>

30
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.563
<v Speaker 1>an unaccountable system of arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 1>censorship and a rule prohibiting a </v>

31
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.430
<v Speaker 1>disclosing security vulnerabilities in </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies that we rely on which could</v>

32
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:35.750
<v Speaker 1>have produced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.643
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which does present a clear and present </v>

34
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:38.984
<v Speaker 1>danger to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is only gonna get worse unless we </v>

35
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:42.080
<v Speaker 1>can do something about it.</v>
