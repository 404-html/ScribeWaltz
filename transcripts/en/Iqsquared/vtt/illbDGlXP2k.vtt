1
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:02.563
<v Speaker 1>Quite often when you hear therapists </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about people going through the </v>

2
00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:09.890
<v Speaker 1>grieving process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that there's a the anger stage,</v>

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.680
<v Speaker 1>the denial stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the depression stage,</v>

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.650
<v Speaker 1>the bargaining stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally the acceptance stage.</v>

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.083
<v Speaker 1>Most people in this country voted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave the EU and I think some of the </v>

6
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:23.840
<v Speaker 1>remainers are still at the anger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>denial stage.</v>

7
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>There is a very clear set of ideas as to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do next.</v>

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.833
<v Speaker 1>The good Lord may not like them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there are perfectly good </v>

9
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>arguments in that document which I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy to send you to explain or teachers</v>

10
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.610
<v Speaker 1>we can do next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas,</v>

11
00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:41.444
<v Speaker 1>can I say that this argument about </v>
<v Speaker 1>bereavement is one of the most patched </v>

12
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.273
<v Speaker 1>realizing</v>

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.360
<v Speaker 2>statements I have ever [inaudible] about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this 52</v>

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.490
<v Speaker 1>you just said we have democracy where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you accept that that is a process.</v>

15
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>You accept that that means that when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes against you,</v>

16
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>you do not start refusing to pay your </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes.</v>

17
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>You do not have a right to violence or </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than unpeaceful demonstrations,</v>

18
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 1>but on the day after a Labor government </v>
<v Speaker 1>is elected,</v>

19
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Tory party activists and and ps decide </v>
<v Speaker 1>the very next day that their main aim in</v>

20
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:26.064
<v Speaker 1>life is to make sure that at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>within five years that is reversed and </v>

21
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:31.014
<v Speaker 1>the idea that they should go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>parliament and vote with the Labor </v>

22
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>government because that is accepting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>will of the people is absurd.</v>

23
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.603
<v Speaker 1>I completely accept as a given fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are going to leave the European good </v>

24
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>

25
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.203
<v Speaker 1>I am complete with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are going to lead well when you say </v>

26
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:49.164
<v Speaker 1>it's good to you except that supplies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wasn't [inaudible] that we </v>

27
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't accept it.</v>

28
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.460
<v Speaker 1>What leads seem to suggest that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't accept it.</v>

29
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>What I am suggesting is that it occurred</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the next year that there was a turn</v>

30
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:02.304
<v Speaker 1>of events by which on February the 21st </v>
<v Speaker 1>next year we had a referendum that went </v>

31
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:08.994
<v Speaker 1>52 to 48% the other way that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally legitimate as the one that went </v>

32
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>52 to 48 they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can referee.</v>

33
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

34
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>you think there is almost no chance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that occurring,</v>

35
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>but to suggest that it's somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegitimate,</v>

36
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.773
<v Speaker 1>an undemocratic for some people to want </v>
<v Speaker 1>that suggest that he's only really </v>

37
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>understand democracy having</v>

38
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.910
<v Speaker 2>okay elected.</v>

39
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.920
<v Speaker 1>They're not because I've been appointed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that voted for the government in power.</v>

40
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Whichever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

41
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.290
<v Speaker 1>that was your interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>parliament through the ballot box?</v>

42
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:45.670
<v Speaker 1>My Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for appointment.</v>

43
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me bring in other people.</v>

44
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Let me bring in other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have a chance to come back.</v>
