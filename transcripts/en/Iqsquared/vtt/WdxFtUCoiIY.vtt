<v Speaker 1>This photograph here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably thinking,</v>

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.233
<v Speaker 1>why have I shown you a picture of a sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a suburban street happens to be in </v>

3
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:08.814
<v Speaker 1>Blackpool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting for this </v>

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.953
<v Speaker 1>discussion because what it shows us a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big crack that goes just underneath my </v>

5
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.014
<v Speaker 1>name there and that crack was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous in Blackpool for a short time </v>

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>because it purportedly appeared after an</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake which was related to fracking</v>

7
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>rather nearby it's fracking for shale </v>
<v Speaker 1>gas,</v>

8
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:27.654
<v Speaker 1>hydraulic fracturing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people said that the fractured </v>

9
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.103
<v Speaker 1>appeared the crack it appeared in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bridge and people also said that the </v>

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.433
<v Speaker 1>motorbikes had fallen over and that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that traffic lights stopped working and </v>

11
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people said yes,</v>

12
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>the crack appeared and it was caused by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fracking.</v>

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.873
<v Speaker 1>Now the BGS detected this earthquake and</v>
<v Speaker 1>our view was there's no way that the </v>

14
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.680
<v Speaker 1>energy of the earthquake could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>caused that crack.</v>

15
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

16
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>if you read the article which was </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to this photograph,</v>

17
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>if you've got knocked down to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom,</v>

18
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:57.624
<v Speaker 1>it said an old black poor man said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact that crack has been there since </v>

19
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>1972.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

20
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.471
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

21
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:05.304
<v Speaker 1>this characterizes the argument of shale</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas that there's an awful lot of stuff </v>

22
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>going on which you can't tell is true or</v>
<v Speaker 1>false and this,</v>

23
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>it's rather got worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately this is a game,</v>

24
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Blackpool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blackpool,</v>

25
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people saying on websites that</v>

26
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.683
<v Speaker 1>Blackpool at the coast of backfill is at</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk of sinking below sea level and our </v>

27
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>seat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sea defenses will have to be rebuilt.</v>

28
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.423
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no foundation whatsoever to </v>

29
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:33.660
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It simply won't happen.</v>
