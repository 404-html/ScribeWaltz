<v Speaker 1>The world is more mobile than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but increase mobility has also brought </v>

2
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>congestion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high emissions and poor air quality with</v>

3

<v Speaker 1>a number of cars on the road set to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quadruple by.</v>

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:21.081
<v Speaker 1>2050 mega cities such as Los Angeles in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sao Paolo are becoming gridlock and road</v>

5
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>speeds in London are approximately the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same as they were a century ago,</v>

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.483
<v Speaker 1>11 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If mobility is to remain the lifeblood </v>

00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>of our economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need smart deliverable solutions.</v>

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.853
<v Speaker 1>Car sharing pioneered by organizations </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Zipcar and buzz car could be one </v>

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:46.434
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every shared car takes 15 private cars </v>

10
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:50.814
<v Speaker 1>off the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Driverless cars are also gaining </v>

11
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>momentum as a safer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaner,</v>

12
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>and more efficient way of getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

13
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>A recent study has shown that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>managing their own speed,</v>

14
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.083
<v Speaker 1>cars increase efficiency by over 40% </v>
<v Speaker 1>this number rises to 273% when the cars </v>

15
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>work together,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a hundred miles an hour or faster,</v>

18
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>they can achieve the equivalent of over </v>
<v Speaker 1>200 miles per us gallon.</v>

19
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Not all solutions are high tech shared </v>

<v Speaker 1>traditional barriers between vehicles </v>

21
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>and pedestrians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result is increased mobility through</v>

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>a sense of shared risk.</v>

23

<v Speaker 1>Shell is working with partners to </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovate mobility.</v>

24
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>That means moving higher volumes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and goods safely,</v>

25
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>cost effectively and with reduced </v>

<v Speaker 1>student engineers and scientists from </v>

<v Speaker 1>vehicles to meet this demand.</v>

28
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.883
<v Speaker 1>The prizes are awarded to the teams that</v>

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Their latest set of scenarios shows that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we build more compact cities,</v>

31
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.680
<v Speaker 1>we could reduce car use by around 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicle kilometers per person per year,</v>

32
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.780
