<v Speaker 1>The world is more mobile than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but increased mobility has also brought </v>

2
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>congestion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high emissions and poor air quality with</v>

3
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:16.110
<v Speaker 1>a number of cars on the road set to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quadruple by.</v>

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.973
<v Speaker 1>20 50 mega cities such as Los Angeles in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sao Paolo or becoming gridlock and road </v>

5
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>speeds in London are approximately the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same as they were a century goal,</v>

6
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.513
<v Speaker 1>11 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If mobility is to remain the lifeblood </v>

7
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>of our economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need smart deliverable solutions.</v>

8
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.823
<v Speaker 1>Car sharing pioneered by organizations </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Zipcar and buzz car could be one </v>

9
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:46.434
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every shared car takes 15 private cars </v>

10
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:50.814
<v Speaker 1>off the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Driverless cars are also gaining </v>

11
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>momentum as a safer cleaner and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient way of getting around.</v>

12
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>A recent study has shown that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>managing their own speed,</v>

13
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>cars increase efficiency by over 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

14
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>This number rises to 273 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the cars worked together,</v>

15
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.593
<v Speaker 1>their sky Tran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a system of personal jetson's style </v>

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>gliding above congested streets at 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour or faster.</v>

18
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>They can achieve the equivalent of over </v>
<v Speaker 1>200 miles per us gallon.</v>

19
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Not all solutions are high tech shared </v>
<v Speaker 1>space projects in city centers,</v>

20
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.823
<v Speaker 1>strip away traffic lights along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional barriers between vehicles </v>

21
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>and pedestrians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result is increased mobility through</v>

22
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>a sense of shared risk.</v>

23
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Shell is working with partners to </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovate mobility.</v>

24
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>That means moving higher volumes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and goods safely,</v>

25
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>cost effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with reduced environmental impact.</v>

<v Speaker 1>student engineers and scientists from </v>

27
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>around the world to design and build </v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicles to meet this demand.</v>

28
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.913
<v Speaker 1>The prizes are awarded to the teams that</v>
<v Speaker 1>go the furthest using the least amount </v>

<v Speaker 1>Their latest set of scenarios shows that</v>

31
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.083
<v Speaker 1>if we build more compact cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could reduce car use by around 2000 </v>

32
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:26.274
<v Speaker 1>vehicle kilometers per person per year,</v>
