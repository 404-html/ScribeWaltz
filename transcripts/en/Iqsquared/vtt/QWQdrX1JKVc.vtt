00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.210
<v Speaker 1>What makes it art capital?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:13.211 --> 00:00:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I think I go back to my spin ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>question at the beginning,</v>

3
00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:16.954
<v Speaker 1>which is artists making interesting work</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an artistic environment that's </v>

4
00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.610
<v Speaker 1>conducive for them to make it.</v>

5
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.920
<v Speaker 2>When people talk about London as an art </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital in very positive terms.</v>

6
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 2>The word they always use is the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>they used to only use about New York and</v>

7
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:39.880
<v Speaker 2>that's energy and there's a sense that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when a,</v>

8
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.743
<v Speaker 2>when a certain dynamic occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an energy that kind of pervasive sense </v>

9
00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:45.704
<v Speaker 2>of energy is produced and this seems to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me to be an absolute critical thing and </v>

10
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 2>the artists were very central to making </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happen.</v>

11
00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:52.340
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

12
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.203
<v Speaker 2>that seems to me to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the edge of difference between a place </v>

13
00:00:57.051 --> 00:00:57.884
<v Speaker 2>that's really got something happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>and something someplace that's a nice </v>

14
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 2>showcase or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't have that inner vitality.</v>

15
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.893
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to say that if there is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy that it will translate into </v>

16
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.960
<v Speaker 3>something positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

17
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.843
<v Speaker 3>and I've certainly seen examples as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>said in South Asia where there hasn't </v>

18
00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:21.031
<v Speaker 3>been government funding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas cities have become very,</v>

19
00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:26.041
<v Speaker 3>very interesting spaces for artists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on the other hand,</v>

20
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.383
<v Speaker 3>having seen the examples of Hong Kong </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Singapore where the government does </v>

21
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.243
<v Speaker 3>fund various schemes and does fund art </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools and art education and </v>

22
00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 3>institutions and everything else that </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes along with it,</v>

23
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.213
<v Speaker 3>it is much easier for artists to live in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that environment and for an art capital </v>

24
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.550
<v Speaker 3>to grow out of that environment.</v>

25
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a city.</v>

26
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 4>You just have to be able to attract </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are artists,</v>

27
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.653
<v Speaker 4>which is echoing something you said </v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier and maybe you have to be a bit </v>

28
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 4>of a mess of a city sometimes to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

29
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.470
<v Speaker 4>You have to be interested in in in ways </v>
<v Speaker 4>that might be messy ways.</v>

30
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.353
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lived in Los Angeles for a long time </v>

31
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.100
<v Speaker 4>and there was a very odd ball art group </v>
<v Speaker 4>of artists there.</v>

32
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 4>They were really mavericks who didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to go to New York.</v>

33
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by choosing to be in Los Angeles,</v>

34
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 4>they were really thumbing their nose at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the artist stablish mint.</v>

35
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.310
<v Speaker 4>But it included people like every Shay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>

36
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 4>Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul Mccarthy,</v>

37
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:36.860
<v Speaker 4>Chris Burden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Raymond Pettibone,</v>

38
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 4>artists who are very well known,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were all extremely eccentric,</v>

39
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.733
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they really didn't want to be part </v>

40
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:50.151
<v Speaker 4>of this art establishment in La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when I was living.</v>

41
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:51.324
<v Speaker 4>There was much more of a messy place </v>
<v Speaker 4>just like the way in London in some </v>

42
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a messy labyrinthine city,</v>

43
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spread out over miles scenerio.</v>

44
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

45
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 4>so I think when I think of a place like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Singapore,</v>

46
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 4>I think it's got to get a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>dirtier.</v>
