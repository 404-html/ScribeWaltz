00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ said that the poor will </v>
<v Speaker 1>always be among,</v>

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first time in human history,</v>

3
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>we have the chance to eradicate absolute</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>We have all the resources needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's less,</v>

5
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>much less than 1% of the economic output</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.843
<v Speaker 1>We know how to do it and it is done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Them and China alone has brought 600 </v>

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>million people of the poverty in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last few decades.</v>

8
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.243
<v Speaker 1>And we have reduced absolute poverty by </v>
<v Speaker 1>1% every year since 19 1919 but there's </v>

9
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>also be a frank reaching the last part </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be more difficult.</v>

10
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>They living in franchise states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most folks in the,</v>

11
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>in the country side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are women.</v>

12
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>They belong to national minorities to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hard task.</v>

13
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.510
<v Speaker 1>But it is possible just about mobilizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the political will to get the dumb.</v>

14
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's a revoke the old slogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

15
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:57.834
<v Speaker 1>we can.</v>
