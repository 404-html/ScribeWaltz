00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.013
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to share briefly with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>before concluding some of the work that </v>

2
00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:07.680
<v Speaker 1>we've been doing on urban China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the end of 2010,</v>

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese urban population was existed</v>
<v Speaker 1>estimated,</v>

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 660 million people by 20,</v>

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.843
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and additional 300 million people are </v>

6
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:26.841
<v Speaker 1>expected to have joined the urban ranks </v>
<v Speaker 1>of China by my by migration or birth.</v>

7
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to Mckinsey,</v>

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.580
<v Speaker 1>as many as a quarter of total global </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth in liquid fuel demand in the next</v>

9
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>20 years is expected just to come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>China's cities.</v>

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.953
<v Speaker 1>Shell's been working in China for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and we've recently considered </v>

11
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.403
<v Speaker 1>urbanization there as part of a project </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is looked more broadly at the </v>

12
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>future energy needs of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the key insights,</v>

13
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:54.144
<v Speaker 1>and I think one of the most exciting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that that study was able to find </v>

14
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.533
<v Speaker 1>is that by focusing on density alone are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in small to medium sized cities and </v>

15
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:02.814
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about creating a density </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly equal to the average density of </v>

16
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:07.674
<v Speaker 1>London or or the density of Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be possible to contain all </v>

17
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>urban growth in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To 20,</v>

18
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:13.734
<v Speaker 1>30 within the existing urban footprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we looked at something like 480 </v>

19
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>cities have of 100,000 to half a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

20
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.103
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in looking at this and that move alone </v>

21
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:25.674
<v Speaker 1>would save an estimated 75,000 square </v>
<v Speaker 1>kilometers of arable land in a country </v>

22
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:31.044
<v Speaker 1>which is crying out for arable land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an area almost the size of </v>

23
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Scotland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in doing so,</v>

24
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:36.774
<v Speaker 1>it would create the conditions by which </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy could be reduced and emissions </v>

25
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:41.214
<v Speaker 1>impacted.</v>
