1
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:02.783
<v Speaker 1>My point of view for what it's worth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I don't think terrorism is very </v>

2
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:08.040
<v Speaker 1>important and I think we make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>And by making it important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make it important.</v>

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does not matter very much.</v>

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>A terrorist incident is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an accident.</v>

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.543
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it affects the people directly affected </v>

7
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:21.950
<v Speaker 1>by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but terrorism does not threaten states.</v>

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't threaten the integrity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>America or Britain,</v>

9
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.543
<v Speaker 1>that they can't invade us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't do serious damage to our </v>

10
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>economy unless we let them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cannot affect our values,</v>

11
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>our democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that,</v>

12
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.060
<v Speaker 1>unless we let them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are to all intensive purposes,</v>

14
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.763
<v Speaker 1>useless criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They simply blow things up and kill </v>

15
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The early point at which they threatened</v>

16
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:44.264
<v Speaker 1>us is by our reaction to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no standing whatsoever other </v>

17
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:48.474
<v Speaker 1>than in terms of our reaction to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And our reaction to them is conditioned </v>

18
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:54.100
<v Speaker 1>by the publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We give them a,</v>

19
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.143
<v Speaker 1>they depend upon publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The multiplier publicies what makes the </v>

20
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Terrorism Act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist.</v>

21
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a killing.</v>

22
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.873
<v Speaker 1>That's why very few terrorist incidents </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred in autocratic and dictatorial </v>

23
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get any publicity.</v>

24
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.013
<v Speaker 1>They get publicity where we give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicity and it's that publicity that </v>

25
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:12.144
<v Speaker 1>they feed.</v>
