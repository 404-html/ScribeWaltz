<v Speaker 1>The international community has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly good at coming up with bryce </v>

2
00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:13.510
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm clever solutions to the problems.</v>

3
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.523
<v Speaker 1>Besetting nations like Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have been woefully poor at </v>

4
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.340
<v Speaker 1>implementing those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Center of Islamic radicalism,</v>

5
00:00:24.341 --> 00:00:28.990
<v Speaker 1>the hiding place of his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bit and the only us ally,</v>

6
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.450
<v Speaker 1>which Washington regularly bombs.</v>

7
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 2>At least the drones do not kill British </v>
<v Speaker 2>and US servicemen.</v>

8
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>We will never leave Pakistan because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan is part of Britain,</v>

9
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 2>India and Pakistan and I'm glad they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>bone or the same room,</v>

10
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 2>but it was more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just a Zambian section.</v>

11
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.543
<v Speaker 1>Einstein defined madness is doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing over and over again and </v>

12
00:00:57.581 --> 00:01:00.070
<v Speaker 1>expecting a different result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is madness.</v>

13
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.680
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm representative.</v>

14
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:03.514
<v Speaker 3>I mean what makes me unrepresentative </v>
<v Speaker 3>just because I speak English this </v>

15
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.520
<v Speaker 3>evening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have a conversation with you if you</v>

16
00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 3>want later on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes me more sensitive.</v>
