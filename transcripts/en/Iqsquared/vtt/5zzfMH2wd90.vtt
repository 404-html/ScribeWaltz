1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
<v Speaker 1>It was what we haven't talked about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>collaboration.</v>

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie sort of creativity,</v>

3
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>whatever you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're a fine artist,</v>

4
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:06.024
<v Speaker 1>it is about collaboration and you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite specific about what you bring to </v>

5
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Speaker 1>the party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the visual,</v>

6
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:14.850
<v Speaker 1>the imaginative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you always work with great writers.</v>

7
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.753
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to because I'm not a very good </v>

8
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

9
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I can write situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can write the ideas,</v>

10
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I can have ideas about the characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't write good dialogue.</v>

11
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.514
<v Speaker 1>It's very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I always work with people who </v>

12
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd love working.</v>

13
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:32.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think that comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.070
<v Speaker 1>once you're in a group like pies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

15
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.023
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I was separate to some </v>

16
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was always collaborative.</v>

17
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.953
<v Speaker 1>And I love working with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's one reason I got bored with </v>

18
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>animation because it's just me and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>

19
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.180
<v Speaker 1>And I love other people's ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the,</v>

20
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:51.014
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the need that I have to argue for why I </v>

21
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>want something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to convince somebody else,</v>

22
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>which is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just saying I want it.</v>

23
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the whole process,</v>

24
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love also,</v>

25
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.343
<v Speaker 1>and that's when the actors really become</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful cause you spent a year or so </v>

26
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>writing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repairing it,</v>

27
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>getting all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything ready and you go to work.</v>

28
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>And now the actors come in and I spent a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of time choosing hopefully the right</v>

29
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

30
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>and then they come in with very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different ideas about how to do a scene.</v>

31
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>And so the daily business of shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes surprising all the time.</v>

32
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:23.244
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>It will be on your toes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

34
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Speaker 1>it's not me just following my </v>
<v Speaker 1>storyboards process.</v>

35
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's an a seeing the process.</v>

36
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>It's very organic consents and nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in and rains when it's supposed to</v>

37
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>be a sunny day for every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are shifting it.</v>

38
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>So the whole process is alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it's fun.</v>

39
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.233
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

40
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 1>most of the time I'm screaming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tearing my hair out because it's not the</v>

41
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>way I want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

42
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>but the point is to surround yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people who are really good,</v>

43
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>who are opinionated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't,</v>

44
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>who aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes ma'am.</v>

45
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I watched so many filmmakers and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're surrounded by yes,</v>

46
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>peak events and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want people that argue with me.</v>

47
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>They'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

48
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.993
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time we were doing </v>

49
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 1>time Bennett's I'd got myself in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner,</v>

50
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:14.634
<v Speaker 1>literally shooting into a corner and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole set is back there and I couldn't </v>

51
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:18.774
<v Speaker 1>quite make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the prop guy came by the prop guy </v>

52
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing terry?</v>

53
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>And he prop guy talking to direct like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

54
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a hierarchy hierarchy here.</v>

55
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 1>But he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing here?</v>

56
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we just do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically,</v>

57
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>is it Gabby?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he said,</v>

58
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's absolutely right.</v>

59
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>And so ever since then I just listened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to everybody and I'm not,</v>

60
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.753
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new robotic or insecure to reject all </v>

61
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:48.834
<v Speaker 1>these ideas because ultimately I'm smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to know that I have the ultimate </v>

62
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 1>power of deciding Yay or nay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I keep saying to people,</v>

63
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>because people think I'm an old tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

64
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a field to,</v>

65
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all I was coming from everybody.</v>

66
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>And I get the credit or blame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my job.</v>
