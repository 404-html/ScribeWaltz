1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.370
<v Speaker 1>In credential guesses?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A fairly good example,</v>

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.443
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will it really be replicable elsewhere </v>

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.800
<v Speaker 1>in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the success of North America.</v>

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.083
<v Speaker 1>Is that going to happen in China and </v>
<v Speaker 1>South America and maybe in more modest </v>

5
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>form here that's not very certain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the Bolus Ebay,</v>

6
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll say public debate about fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't really sure,</v>

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should we do that?</v>

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.043
<v Speaker 1>But if uncle venture guests is </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful at re doubles the previous </v>

9
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>thought resource base of gas and then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>really makes it a real game changer.</v>

10
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:31.104
<v Speaker 1>You can really go for different types of</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy systems in a sense that you can </v>

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.653
<v Speaker 1>early gains replace coal by guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Su built an big infrastructure </v>

12
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>on guests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

14
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>you start opening up options for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

15
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.630
<v Speaker 1>I will call and say you have room to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maneuver in 2020s,</v>

16
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>2030s because you haven't guests </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure,</v>

17
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>which is also easily as they'll ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra cost.</v>

18
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>They make suitable for hydrogen gas or </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquid hydrogen.</v>

19
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.913
<v Speaker 1>So actually my count,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lucky because you have an </v>

20
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure you can piggy back on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do another roots,</v>

21
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.403
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have the infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it becomes very expensive to </v>

22
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>introduce hydrogen.</v>
