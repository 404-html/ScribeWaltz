00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.413
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this interest in mania as this interest </v>

2
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 1>in these levees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did all this come from?</v>

3
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.530
<v Speaker 1>What's there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you go back maybe to an earlier time</v>

4
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:34.060
<v Speaker 1>where this kind of an obsession or took </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold the view?</v>

5
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6
00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:36.484
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call it an obsession because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be a wrong description of </v>

7
00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 1>myself to be obsessive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

8
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm just very calm and I'm trying to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a thinking men and people always think I</v>

9
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.700
<v Speaker 1>this madman in this obsessed and he must</v>
<v Speaker 1>be insane.</v>

10
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know,</v>

11
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.540
<v Speaker 1>but I know what's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

12
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.403
<v Speaker 1>I know all the top locking us out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have to say I'm the only one </v>

13
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:04.510
<v Speaker 1>probably in southern England who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinically sane.</v>

14
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>So one example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

15
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

16
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>

17
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 1>how can I describe it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It in a,</v>

18
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:18.790
<v Speaker 1>in a way possibly dated back to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>

19
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.653
<v Speaker 1>which is spent in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very remote mountain village in </v>

20
00:01:23.621 --> 00:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Bavaria.</v>

21
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 1>You moved when you were three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four days old now,</v>

22
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.403
<v Speaker 1>10 or 14 days old and bombs hit Munich </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my mother fled because of bomb </v>

23
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.963
<v Speaker 1>pettit right next to our place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you went to this tiny town of </v>

24
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Zach's suck cornea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not even a town.</v>

25
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:46.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a tiny village and devastate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>farmhouse outside,</v>

26
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.350
<v Speaker 1>outside of Saffron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I grew up.</v>

27
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.610
<v Speaker 1>And of course I had no idea of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

28
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.630
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had never seen cinema until I was 11 I</v>

29
00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:02.980
<v Speaker 1>didn't even know that cinema existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in his children,</v>

30
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.230
<v Speaker 1>his children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had nothing.</v>

31
00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were always very hungry.</v>

32
00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:09.910
<v Speaker 1>That's must one side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't really matter.</v>

33
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 1>It mattered to the mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very,</v>

34
00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:17.170
<v Speaker 1>very hard for the mother to not be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to feed the children.</v>

35
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>But we had no toys and we had no games </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had to invent to games.</v>

36
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.470
<v Speaker 1>And you found you found toys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

37
00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:29.650
<v Speaker 1>well found toys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call it toys with toys.</v>

38
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>We found weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found live and ammunition mission and</v>

39
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.410
<v Speaker 1>pursue costs and things like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've,</v>

40
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.150
<v Speaker 1>you've spoken about that moment in time </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

41
00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:44.080
<v Speaker 1>as a happy moment in [inaudible] was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very happy,</v>

42
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.943
<v Speaker 1>very wonderful childhood with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers and other refugee children and </v>

43
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:52.210
<v Speaker 1>farm children around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were getting a 14,</v>

44
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.210
<v Speaker 1>actually 13 and one girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.253
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was always with us and she was the </v>

46
00:02:58.301 --> 00:03:03.301
<v Speaker 1>rowdiest the most true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly independent and in courageous of,</v>

47
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>of us all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

48
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

49
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dreamt of,</v>

50
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:16.801
<v Speaker 1>of shooting a crow because I had seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>the route workers who had shot a crow.</v>

52
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:18.544
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had anything to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they pluck the feathers and they </v>

53
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>cooked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was,</v>

54

<v Speaker 1>on the top of the soup there was,</v>

56
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>as we called it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ice of fat floating,</v>

57
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>which was sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were hungry and I wanted to shoot</v>

58
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>a crow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd never managed to the machine.</v>

59
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Submachine gun was too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too unruly.</v>

60
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.373
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh.</v>
