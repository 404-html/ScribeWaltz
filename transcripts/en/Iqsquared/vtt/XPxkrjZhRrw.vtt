1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>What we're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying at least is that there </v>

2
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:04.164
<v Speaker 1>should be an evolutionary process to </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy as there was in Hong Kong and </v>

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned that in the year 2017 Hong</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kong will have universal suffered.</v>

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that remains very much to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I doubt very much whether they will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine and one man,</v>

6
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:20.244
<v Speaker 1>one vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would be delighted to be proven </v>

7
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:23.740
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.773
<v Speaker 1>Can I answer that question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it depends on what you mean by </v>

9
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:27.804
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think democracy centers just on </v>

10
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>one man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one vote.</v>

11
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to concede that at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>

12
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:38.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe one man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one vote is a little too early,</v>

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.743
<v Speaker 1>but there are the other aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy which I believe to be </v>

14
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:47.481
<v Speaker 1>important for all nation and for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings and that is human dignity,</v>

15
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.303
<v Speaker 1>some basic rights and freedoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The right to participate in the </v>

16
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>governance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to improve the quality of governance,</v>

17
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>to have some say in issues that affect </v>
<v Speaker 1>their everyday life,</v>

18
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>to have the rule of law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the role of men,</v>

19
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.943
<v Speaker 1>not rule by law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to have an independent judiciary </v>

20
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 1>that is not subject to the dictates of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one party system rule.</v>

21
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with Martin that in the three 30</v>

22
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:20.601
<v Speaker 1>years since opened our policy that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been phenomenal economic growth that has</v>

23
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>been a degree of personal freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>social mobility.</v>

24
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.823
<v Speaker 1>But the sad fact is that in recent years</v>
<v Speaker 1>market economy reforms have stalled and </v>

25
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>the government has backtracked on legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>reforms.</v>

26
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>All judicial organs in China are now </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject to the dictates of the one party</v>

27
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:43.554
<v Speaker 1>system rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we seriously thing that the </v>

28
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>population that the 1.3 billion people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in mainland China,</v>

29
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:51.024
<v Speaker 1>I contend to accept this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say that there are mass support for </v>

30
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.014
<v Speaker 1>the one party system role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it then that we get people in </v>

31
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>from mainland coming to Hong Kong to </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in demonstration,</v>

32
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.693
<v Speaker 1>particularly against the blind dissident</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the young young who was alleged to </v>

33
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>have committed suicide</v>

34
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
