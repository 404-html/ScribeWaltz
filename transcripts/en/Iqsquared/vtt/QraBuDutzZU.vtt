1
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Everybody can agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in England,</v>

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.233
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this was a crisis whereas the made </v>

3
00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:14.561
<v Speaker 1>in USA label and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we export it or toxic mortgages,</v>

4
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact we send a thank you note all the</v>

6
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>time to your for buying so many of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>toxic mortgages.</v>

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>We sold about 40 percent of them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe and,</v>

8
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had it not been for that the downturn</v>

9
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 1>in the US would have been much worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were three parts of the response.</v>

10
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.580
<v Speaker 1>The first was a stimulus and when Obama </v>
<v Speaker 1>got elected,</v>

11
00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:39.680
<v Speaker 1>it was good that he finally got around </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

12
00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Bush didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do anything about this,</v>

13
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>but it was too small and it was not well</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed.</v>

14
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to be out of this crisis</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly.</v>

15
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.513
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that will be emerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of this crisis is realization of </v>

16
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>countries that have bigger reserves did </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

17
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.250
<v Speaker 1>So there'll be an even greater demand </v>
<v Speaker 1>for savings.</v>

18
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Net will get reduce global aggregate </v>
<v Speaker 1>demand.</v>

19
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>You have failed really to reform our </v>
<v Speaker 1>global economic system.</v>

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.120
<v Speaker 1>We have failed to reform a regulatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

21
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.483
<v Speaker 1>failed to provide the kind of economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that would provide stability and </v>

22
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:20.600
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the result would add is that,</v>

23
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.463
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these economic weaknesses are going to </v>

24
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:24.584
<v Speaker 1>persist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the American tax payer has </v>

25
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:31.241
<v Speaker 1>been ripped off in essence by the band </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the American taxpayer,</v>

26
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.470
<v Speaker 1>very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got treated very badly.</v>

27
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.500
<v Speaker 1>The typical pattern in the chaos of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

28
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.843
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bankers who caused the crisis than </v>

29
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.510
<v Speaker 1>steal money massively because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't noticing that.</v>

30
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.770
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

31
00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:49.600
<v Speaker 1>this is going to happen again in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

32
00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:50.434
<v Speaker 1>I hoped that we had better institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what it turned out is that we had </v>

33
00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:55.564
<v Speaker 1>better mechanism for theft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such an elementary issue of </v>

34
00:01:58.031 --> 00:01:58.864
<v Speaker 1>incentives.</v>

35
00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.793
<v Speaker 1>If you're too big to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have incentive to gamble </v>

36
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:06.040
<v Speaker 1>because if you gamble and when you walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>off with the prophets,</v>

37
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:06.874
<v Speaker 1>even gamble and lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government picks up the tab a why </v>

38
00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:13.810
<v Speaker 1>not gamble?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the UK did a much,</v>

39
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.520
<v Speaker 1>much better in three ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

40
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

41
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.690
<v Speaker 1>you had some sense of accountability </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

42
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.320
<v Speaker 1>some of the ceos had to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>

43
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 1>you put some conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't put any condition,</v>

44
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:26.954
<v Speaker 1>so we allow the money to pour in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pour out and we gave the story that we </v>

45
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:34.120
<v Speaker 1>had to recapitalize the banks in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to help them land.</v>

46
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.120
<v Speaker 1>But if money is pouring in and pouring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

47
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.540
<v Speaker 1>that's not recapitalizing the banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirdly,</v>

48
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.613
<v Speaker 1>you tried a wasn't totally successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you understood you wanted the banks </v>

49
00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:50.680
<v Speaker 1>to start lending and you try to get some</v>
<v Speaker 1>incentives,</v>

50
00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:54.880
<v Speaker 1>some institutional reforms to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>banks to land the criticism,</v>

51
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 1>the somewhere I work that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

52
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

53
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.340
<v Speaker 1>I very good at identifying a market </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure,</v>

54
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a little bit less students in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and talking about government failure.</v>

55
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me say that anybody in America lived</v>

56
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>through the Bush administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understands government failure.</v>

57
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>We have to think much more carefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how we spend money.</v>

58
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.800
<v Speaker 1>So I'm very critical of the hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars that we spend in the</v>

59
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.351
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

60
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 1>weapons that don't work against enemies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't exist.</v>

61
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.303
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get neither security nor economic </v>

62
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that seems to me a,</v>

63
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>a good target for cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we disagree allocating that money to</v>

64
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:37.444
<v Speaker 1>investments that will lead to higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth and therefore lower a national </v>

65
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>debt in the long run.</v>
