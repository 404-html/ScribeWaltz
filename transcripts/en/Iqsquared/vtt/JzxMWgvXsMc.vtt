00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.453
<v Speaker 1>The problem we have is that the damage </v>
<v Speaker 1>we coast to the global environment is </v>

2
00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>not reflected in the price of the energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>we consume.</v>

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.863
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most basic definition of the </v>

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.230
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have.</v>

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.890
<v Speaker 1>If you bring even partly the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

7
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.113
<v Speaker 1>the cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the what we call the external cost of </v>

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>your fuel consumption into the price of </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy you raised,</v>

9
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.880
<v Speaker 1>your price is a bit higher or much </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher if you do it.</v>

10
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>If you do it a meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way around that.</v>

11
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.913
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Addressing climate change is all about </v>

12
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.843
<v Speaker 1>changing the relative prices of energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the carbon intensive ones </v>

13
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.783
<v Speaker 1>relatedley more expensive and the carbon</v>
<v Speaker 1>less intensive one relatively less </v>

14
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:50.594
<v Speaker 1>expensive.</v>

15
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.853
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about what the public will </v>

16
00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:56.150
<v Speaker 2>believe and what they will take in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of messaging.</v>

17
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A ton of ton of a democracy.</v>

18
00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:02.600
<v Speaker 2>It actually matters.</v>

19
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.131
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>

20
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't the point that we are.</v>

21
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.390
<v Speaker 3>It was Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Stevens,</v>

22
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 3>who pointed out that it was a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with the public</v>

23
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.503
<v Speaker 2>believed and what the power of those who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have got all authority of the eloquence </v>

24
00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:15.694
<v Speaker 2>in order to convey the right message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The saving the world message of alcohol </v>

25
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 2>was absolutely hopeless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not convincing anybody at all.</v>
