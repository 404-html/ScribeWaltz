00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.390
<v Speaker 1>What Kara Keller did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and two,</v>

2
00:00:04.391 --> 00:00:05.051
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3
00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:05.884
<v Speaker 1>eight to 1280 was only the final apt </v>
<v Speaker 1>long process which started when the </v>

4
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:14.944
<v Speaker 1>founder of Rome Romulus welcomed </v>
<v Speaker 1>refugees and asylum seekers to his new </v>

5
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>city by the Tiber to be proper Roman </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens,</v>

6
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>which carried on as citizenship was </v>
<v Speaker 1>spread among those whom Rome conquered,</v>

7
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
<v Speaker 1>and when people from far of field became</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roman emperors,</v>

8
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Trajan and Hadrian from Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Septimius severus from North Africa,</v>

9
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.110
<v Speaker 1>that could never have happened at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Athens,</v>

10
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.903
<v Speaker 1>and at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaves in their millions were fruit at </v>

11
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.683
<v Speaker 1>Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at in the process completely unlike in </v>

12
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:07.681
<v Speaker 1>the Greek world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They became full Roman citizens.</v>

13
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.063
<v Speaker 1>Many fewer slaves wherever fried in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Athens or any of the Greek states in </v>

14
00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>which we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they were freed,</v>

15
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 1>they certainly didn't become citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was an incorporated community.</v>

16
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some observant people in Greece early on</v>

17
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>spotted these weird habits of the Romans</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were amazed.</v>

18
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>A few of the smartest began to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe Roman openness was the secret</v>

19
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.550
<v Speaker 1>of her success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I think.</v>

20
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 1>I think too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think robes real Rome's rough.</v>

21
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.250
<v Speaker 1>It's in your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's open,</v>

22
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 1>it's welcoming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's us.</v>

23
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.083
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

24
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
