<v Speaker 1>Squared,</v>

2
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.023
<v Speaker 2>the best hope for modernization and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately liberalization in the Arab </v>

3
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:26.264
<v Speaker 2>and Muslim worlds today lies in </v>
<v Speaker 2>incumbent regimes who recognize that </v>

4
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.833
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic modernization is essential to </v>

5
00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 2>their country's future.</v>

6
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.523
<v Speaker 3>How do groups like Al Qaeda operate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be clear by now that in </v>

7
00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:41.484
<v Speaker 3>parasitic fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these groups feed off of host nations </v>

8
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.333
<v Speaker 3>that are weak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the relief from the life in </v>

9
00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:51.100
<v Speaker 3>purgatory that constitutes the average </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of the average Arab,</v>

10
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.470
<v Speaker 3>that life is about unemployment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real rates of up to 35 and 40 percent,</v>

11
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.603
<v Speaker 3>and young men who when polled </v>
<v Speaker 3>consistently complained that their </v>

12
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 3>existence offers no hope and no </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity.</v>

13
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.103
<v Speaker 3>It is about the fact that the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nations Development Program estimate </v>

14
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.940
<v Speaker 3>that nine percent of every business deal</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Middle East Coast for bribes,</v>

15
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.480
<v Speaker 3>and when students who want to vote step </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the streets of Cairo,</v>

16
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.810
<v Speaker 3>they risk arrest and torture like Karim </v>
<v Speaker 3>Solomon,</v>

17
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.763
<v Speaker 3>who was sodomized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tortured because he demonstrated in </v>

18
00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:20.824
<v Speaker 3>favor of the rule of law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These victims of Middle Eastern </v>

19
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.373
<v Speaker 3>depression are the ones who provide the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oxygen that enables al Qaeda to operate </v>

20
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.730
<v Speaker 3>and it gives resonance to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>political messages.</v>
