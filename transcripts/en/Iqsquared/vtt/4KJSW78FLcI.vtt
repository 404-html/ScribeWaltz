<v Speaker 1>Welcome to today's hot topic from </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence squared.com.</v>

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Too much free speech kills the massacre </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Arizona.</v>

3
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Shows that the USA must learn from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe to curb hate speech.</v>

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Do you agree?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Lone gunman who mowed down Gabrielle</v>

5
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:16.984
<v Speaker 1>giffords was mentally disturbed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but were the outcomes of his ravings </v>

6
00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>caused by the climate of political </v>
<v Speaker 1>hostility.</v>

7
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Pailin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

8
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.390
<v Speaker 1>had placed gunsight icons on Gifford's </v>
<v Speaker 1>congressional district.</v>

9
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.703
<v Speaker 1>Does this mean she shares in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for what happened in </v>

10
00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Britain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politician filled Willis was stripped of</v>

11
00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:39.440
<v Speaker 1>his seat and his party membership for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of polarizing language.</v>

12
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>That's an everyday occurrence in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>USA.</v>

13
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.430
<v Speaker 1>So who has got it right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does liberal democracy need you to get a</v>

14
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:47.264
<v Speaker 1>thick skin or does it need a strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>state protecting us from extreme verbal </v>

15
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:51.614
<v Speaker 1>assault?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are some highlights from Wendy </v>

16
00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:56.690
<v Speaker 1>kaminer confronting Femi autogenous as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they thrash it out.</v>

17
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>We start with femi defending curbs on </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate speech.</v>

18
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less hate will be bread,</v>

19
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.243
<v Speaker 2>and so we would have less fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that hate speech can certainly </v>

20
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 2>be a contributing factor to bigotry and </v>
<v Speaker 2>prejudice.</v>

21
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:16.790
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

22
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.623
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not here defending the merits of </v>

23
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 2>hate speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

24
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.981
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

25
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is always much more dangerous</v>

26
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:31.551
<v Speaker 2>and I also think that it's morally wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>to criminalize speech that we don't like</v>

27
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.750
<v Speaker 2>because we have some sense that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>long run it's going to be,</v>

28
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:40.224
<v Speaker 2>it's going to cause societal harm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People should be given the right to </v>

29
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:47.710
<v Speaker 2>speak yes to the point where it violates</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rights of others.</v>

30
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.210
<v Speaker 2>People may be given the right to express</v>
<v Speaker 2>their concerns about principles,</v>

31
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.533
<v Speaker 2>but not about individual characteristics</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people I'm grateful and proud to </v>

32
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:01.944
<v Speaker 2>live in a country and to be part of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nation that does not tolerate hate </v>

33
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:10.731
<v Speaker 2>speech is if anything that perhaps our </v>
<v Speaker 2>restrictions and hate speech have go far</v>

34
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:13.494
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I can take this opportunity to </v>

35
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:15.924
<v Speaker 2>respond quickly to some of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the first day I really appreciate </v>

36
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 2>her forthrightness in questioning why we</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to have freedom of speech.</v>

37
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.773
<v Speaker 2>Because that's not a statement that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>will generally hear from people in the </v>

38
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 2>US who defend hate speech regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because here,</v>

39
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really so acceptable to say,</v>

40
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in free speech.</v>
