1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.450
<v Speaker 1>What concerns me at the moment is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something much more basic,</v>

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.313
<v Speaker 1>much more fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and much more closely related to the </v>

3
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.940
<v Speaker 1>core of Magna Carta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I,</v>

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.883
<v Speaker 1>what I said a little bit earlier was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one of the fundamental points that </v>

5
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>comes out of Magna Carta is the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to have access to justice.</v>

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>That if you can't enforce your rights in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a court,</v>

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>you have no rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that sense,</v>

8
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.763
<v Speaker 1>David Wright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that universal human rights are gfe if </v>

9
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:27.564
<v Speaker 1>they can't be enforced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why what interests me is not </v>

10
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:31.134
<v Speaker 1>so much universal human rights but </v>
<v Speaker 1>British civil liberties that can be </v>

11
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:35.664
<v Speaker 1>enforced in our courts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what concerns me at the moment is </v>

12
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:40.554
<v Speaker 1>that this government is conducting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustained an ideological attack on </v>

13
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:51.591
<v Speaker 1>access to court and it is parsing almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>without notice in the national media.</v>

14
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I want to give three examples of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

15
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so called reforms to legal aid.</v>

16
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.953
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proposals made two weeks ago </v>

17
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.070
<v Speaker 1>massively to increase court fees which </v>
<v Speaker 1>are passed almost without comment.</v>

18
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.863
<v Speaker 1>And thirdly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new legislation which will restrict </v>

19
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>access to judicial review.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>

20
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>in relation to legal aid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as many of you will know,</v>

21
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years ago,</v>

22
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>removed legal aid for most forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civil litigation,</v>

24
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>a whole areas where previously legal aid</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been available.</v>

25
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:32.184
<v Speaker 1>It was removed from including almost all</v>
<v Speaker 1>family law cases except where there's </v>

26
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.983
<v Speaker 1>recent evidence of domestic abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has resulted in a far greater </v>

27
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:43.974
<v Speaker 1>numbers of cases where people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>litigants in person cases taking much </v>

28
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>longer and appalling situations arising </v>
<v Speaker 1>in court.</v>

29
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.953
<v Speaker 1>A situation a few weeks ago where a </v>
<v Speaker 1>father was seeking access to a child </v>

30
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.943
<v Speaker 1>where the mother said that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually abused the child where because </v>

31
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:05.004
<v Speaker 1>no legal aid was available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the judge was contemplating a situation </v>

32
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.233
<v Speaker 1>where the father would have to cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>examine his own child on the truth of </v>

33
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>the mother's allegation that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>abused that child,</v>

34
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.813
<v Speaker 1>that that's an intolerable situation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have in any court and it is the direct </v>

35
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>result of government policy.</v>

36
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.743
<v Speaker 1>And the Lord Chancellor Christopher </v>
<v Speaker 1>grayling sent leading council into that </v>

37
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.064
<v Speaker 1>court to argue that it was the farthest </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice to be unrepresented because he </v>

38
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>had the disposable income of 10,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds a year.</v>

39
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened.</v>

40
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.003
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legal Aid and the Public Accounts </v>

41
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Committee yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>produced a report in which they pointed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that the Ministry of Justice,</v>

43
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:49.224
<v Speaker 1>it introduced these reforms without </v>
<v Speaker 1>first taking the trouble to work out </v>

44
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:53.154
<v Speaker 1>whether the money they would save would </v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact be saved or whether they would </v>

45
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:57.654
<v Speaker 1>simply be not con costs in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>departments because of the physical and </v>

46
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:01.924
<v Speaker 1>mental harm done to people who would no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer be able to get access to legal </v>

47
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:05.644
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the comment of the Public Accounts </v>

48
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.703
<v Speaker 1>Committee at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cross a party committee was that the </v>

49
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.933
<v Speaker 1>Ministry of Justice now has no idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's actually saved any money </v>

50
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:16.114
<v Speaker 1>from these reforms.</v>
