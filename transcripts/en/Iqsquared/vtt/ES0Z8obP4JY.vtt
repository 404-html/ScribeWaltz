1
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I am pro intervention with respect to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Syria,</v>

2
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker 1>but pro intervention with the following </v>
<v Speaker 1>caveat,</v>

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I think intervention at this point is </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitable.</v>

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how this regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's fall,</v>

5
00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:18.844
<v Speaker 1>might be construed as inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's certainly with the White House </v>

6
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:21.714
<v Speaker 1>has been saying it could still very well</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry on for at least a year if not </v>

7
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you define,</v>

8
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>define for us what I believe in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of safe zone scenario for Syria,</v>

9
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>one that is being now mooted by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkish government,</v>

10
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.463
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been threatened to be imposed </v>

11
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>by the Turkish government since last </v>
<v Speaker 1>June.</v>

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>And I also would agree that there needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be some kind of aerial component.</v>

13
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:41.844
<v Speaker 1>I mean the rebels cannot face a tanks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and helicopter gunships which are now </v>

14
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:47.154
<v Speaker 1>firing on them alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There needs to be some kind of a full </v>

15
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a military intervention.</v>

16
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:53.360
<v Speaker 1>By that I don't mean out in occupation.</v>

17
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.193
<v Speaker 1>All Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about things that are </v>

18
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:56.364
<v Speaker 1>already being put into motion are </v>
<v Speaker 1>already being considered by the United </v>

19
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.233
<v Speaker 1>States and by Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an enforced no fly zone for snow </v>

20
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.210
<v Speaker 1>flies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm to just harder you through this,</v>

21
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.053
<v Speaker 1>but could that be light on the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya model where that means not just </v>

22
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>enforcing it but actually taking out </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon air to air defense capability?</v>

23
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:13.561
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also,</v>

24
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:14.394
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep in mind a no fly zone doesn't just </v>

25
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.730
<v Speaker 1>necessarily bomb barracks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

26
00:01:17.731 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that in this case that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called for it.</v>

27
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.833
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would also target the placement of </v>

28
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:23.904
<v Speaker 1>hell heavy artillery tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would also control the [inaudible] </v>

29
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:27.744
<v Speaker 1>highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the main ground transport </v>

30
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:30.114
<v Speaker 1>throughout all of Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot really can conduct this kind </v>

31
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:32.994
<v Speaker 1>of ground campaign against the rebels if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't operate on the main </v>

32
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>thoroughfares of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

33
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>it would be similar to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Olivia style intervention,</v>

34
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:40.640
<v Speaker 1>but not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

35
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.483
<v Speaker 1>the two countries are vastly different </v>
<v Speaker 1>in many ways now deem your shaking your </v>

36
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

37
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 2>This has disastrous go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this option goes,</v>

38
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.490
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

39
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Speaker 2>what the capabilities of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

40
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 2>of the Syrian army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about one of the mightiest</v>

41
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 2>armies in the Middle East with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with tanks and heavy alternately and,</v>

42
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 2>and war ships and jet fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

43
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.833
<v Speaker 2>and what are you going to destroy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how much are you going to destroy </v>

44
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 2>without going into a full war with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country?</v>

45
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is absolute disastrous option.</v>

46
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.640
<v Speaker 2>The intervention will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will open the country into a,</v>

47
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.563
<v Speaker 2>an abyss.</v>
