1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Oda goes from a developed or developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.363
<v Speaker 1>it is vertical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The developing country becomes a middle </v>

3
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>income country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it graduates from being a recipient,</v>

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.320
<v Speaker 1>then another developing country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's to learn from it?</v>

5
00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:15.154
<v Speaker 1>Success Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they engage in south south </v>

6
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient demand driven,</v>

7
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>knowledge sharing and capacity building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.593
<v Speaker 1>it's horizontal and it goes both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this rent here wants to keep on </v>

9
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:29.994
<v Speaker 1>engaging with his former partner country</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to scale up together the lessons </v>

10
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>learned into this new partner country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So triangular cooperation is boring.</v>

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 1>This is a win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>

12
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>win situation in which all countries in </v>
<v Speaker 1>both developed and developing share them</v>

13
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:45.954
<v Speaker 1>comparative advantages and work together</v>
<v Speaker 1>with one single thing in my very </v>

14
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>policies for better lives.</v>
