1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Technology gives us the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create relationships in the supply chain</v>

2
00:00:03.891 --> 00:00:04.724
<v Speaker 1>relationships between producers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumers much more flexibly and </v>

3
00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:08.624
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing it already in food </v>

4
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:10.784
<v Speaker 1>production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in transport resources such as journeys </v>

5
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:15.680
<v Speaker 1>in cars and parking spaces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.490
<v Speaker 1>and we're seeing it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the manufacturer of custom goods.</v>

7
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:20.324
<v Speaker 1>So the image on the bottom left is taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>from shapeways where you can three d </v>

8
00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:24.614
<v Speaker 1>print pretty much anything that you like</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the cost of this technology is </v>

9
00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>coming down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.153
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

11
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.430
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these marketplaces are transactional and</v>

12
00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:34.264
<v Speaker 1>we've got interesting opportunities to </v>
<v Speaker 1>affect the rate of exchange used in </v>

13
00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>those transactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

14
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:41.544
<v Speaker 1>an alternative currency that's been in </v>
<v Speaker 1>use in Switzerland for nearly a hundred </v>

15
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.333
<v Speaker 1>years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The where that starts to have </v>

16
00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:46.864
<v Speaker 1>contributed to economic stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Though I suspect with someone from the </v>

17
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:52.600
<v Speaker 1>lse chairing the debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may have a comment on that.</v>

18
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.803
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five towns of cities in the UK have </v>

19
00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:57.574
<v Speaker 1>their own local currencies now with </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar intentions and they're </v>

20
00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:03.244
<v Speaker 1>increasingly using advanced technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>to support those currencies such as the </v>

21
00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:10.180
<v Speaker 1>droplet smartphone payment system that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>being created in,</v>

22
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.023
<v Speaker 1>in Birmingham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These rates of exchange offers the </v>

23
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.800
<v Speaker 1>possibility to compare the complete cost</v>
<v Speaker 1>of goods and services,</v>

24
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:18.634
<v Speaker 1>the financial costs and their social and</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental implications with dynamic </v>

25
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.673
<v Speaker 1>low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly localized value to the </v>

26
00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:25.624
<v Speaker 1>participants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it's worth to me now to have this </v>

27
00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:32.200
<v Speaker 1>service rather than what it might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth to me to have it in two weeks time</v>

28
00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 1>when I really need it.</v>

29
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

30
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.463
<v Speaker 1>I think there's tremendous potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>here to produce new information based </v>

31
00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:41.980
<v Speaker 1>marketplaces that could support more </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable city systems,</v>

32
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.113
<v Speaker 1>but if there such a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we have them do ubiquitously </v>

33
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.083
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

34
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

35
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 1>And that comes down to something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been mentioned by the other by the other</v>

36
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:54.910
<v Speaker 1>speakers were cities are making progress</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this agenda.</v>

37
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.773
<v Speaker 1>It's where the coordinating the use of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their public sector and private sector </v>

38
00:01:59.111 --> 00:01:59.944
<v Speaker 1>assets towards a cocreated division </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards a common set of goals and </v>

39
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:03.874
<v Speaker 1>objectives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in order to win that level of </v>

40
00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:06.754
<v Speaker 1>commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't only need the buy in of the </v>

41
00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:12.430
<v Speaker 1>leaders and managers of those resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need the understanding of all of the</v>

42
00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:15.520
<v Speaker 1>stakeholders that they are accountable </v>
<v Speaker 1>to their employees,</v>

43
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.410
<v Speaker 1>the electorate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their shareholders.</v>

44
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.340
<v Speaker 1>To appeal to that tremendously broad set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of interests.</v>

45
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:22.121
<v Speaker 1>We need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

46
00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 1>to appeal to some common instincts </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst us,</v>

47
00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:25.354
<v Speaker 1>all a sense of narrative and our ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to empathize rather than focus on the </v>

48
00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Speaker 1>financial efficiencies created by smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructures.</v>

49
00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:33.154
<v Speaker 1>And if we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may not get very far because smart </v>

50
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:35.944
<v Speaker 1>ideas cut across silos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those who realize the benefits may </v>

51
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:41.560
<v Speaker 1>not be those who are asked to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>investment in the first case.</v>

52
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 1>And instead we should be concentrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the social and personal and community</v>

53
00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:48.430
<v Speaker 1>value that can be created when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

54
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.293
<v Speaker 1>and I can afford to buy better food </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they could afford to heat their </v>

55
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:55.930
<v Speaker 1>homes properly in winter when they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to affordable transport to places</v>

56
00:02:55.931 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>of employment.</v>
