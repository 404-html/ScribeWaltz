00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.470
<v Speaker 1>The right rises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hard revolting rate rises.</v>

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.043
<v Speaker 1>It feeds off immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it rises when those decent </v>

3
00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:10.330
<v Speaker 1>politicians on the right give it room to</v>
<v Speaker 1>rise and doesn't fight it.</v>

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.703
<v Speaker 1>I watched Marine Le Pen rise and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the conventional parties in France </v>

5
00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:18.730
<v Speaker 1>bent towards her and the advent of Ukip </v>
<v Speaker 1>and its rise is because the conservative</v>

6
00:00:18.731 --> 00:00:19.564
<v Speaker 1>party did the same thing and mark and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angela Merkel is an example of what you </v>

7
00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:25.930
<v Speaker 1>can do to lead a nation to another </v>
<v Speaker 1>destination.</v>

8
00:00:25.931 --> 00:00:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Churchill called us the Mongrel nation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we are,</v>

9
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.513
<v Speaker 1>we are the product of succeeding waves </v>
<v Speaker 1>of immigration into this country and it </v>

10
00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:34.114
<v Speaker 1>makes us what we are and this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mongrel city and it is the most </v>

11
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:41.590
<v Speaker 1>successful global city in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that place,</v>

12
00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:44.560
<v Speaker 1>a barrier up to it as the gentleman over</v>
<v Speaker 1>here once and you remove that.</v>

13
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.753
<v Speaker 1>I disagreed with the idea that it's only</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims who are responsible for </v>

14
00:00:49.391 --> 00:00:50.224
<v Speaker 1>overturning our values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've always been able to find </v>

15
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.700
<v Speaker 1>gentleman over there was right young men</v>
<v Speaker 1>who will see,</v>

16
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.210
<v Speaker 1>who will think it is part of a noble </v>
<v Speaker 1>calls to kill innocent people.</v>

17
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>That was the anarchist at the turn of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19th century.</v>

18
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>It was the bottom line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half guard gang.</v>

19
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.753
<v Speaker 1>It was the road facsia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to go to Baghdad to hear a </v>

20
00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 1>preacher preaching death row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put it.</v>

21
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>I can go to Belfast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These have always been there,</v>

22
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 1>and it is wrong of Malcolm Rifkind to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ascribe this simply to Muslims.</v>

23
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>These are people who wish to overturn </v>
<v Speaker 1>the values,</v>

24
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.893
<v Speaker 1>who happened to be Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've had plenty of Christians </v>

25
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.440
<v Speaker 1>seeking to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

26
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.303
<v Speaker 1>we haven't got all the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the really great </v>

27
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 1>conundrums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges,</v>

28
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.740
<v Speaker 1>moral and practical to confront us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some of the things we ought to be</v>

29
00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:33.574
<v Speaker 1>doing or not doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't got a solution to all of </v>

30
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:36.520
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to think,</v>

31
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.223
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do not do this on the basis of </v>

32
00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:42.394
<v Speaker 1>your humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you will be left with only one way </v>

33
00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:49.000
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moats and walls and barbed wire,</v>

34
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.403
<v Speaker 1>and then you lose your humanity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll create another reason for even </v>

35
00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:53.644
<v Speaker 1>more walls.</v>

36
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.200
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
