00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.050
<v Speaker 1>In response to this notion that Syria </v>
<v Speaker 1>has this mighty formidable army,</v>

2
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be worth asking Paul this,</v>

3
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:14.703
<v Speaker 1>it took the Syrian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mightiest army in the Middle East </v>

4
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.123
<v Speaker 1>for weeks of heavy artillery shelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the deployment of 7,000 soldiers to </v>

5
00:00:22.451 --> 00:00:23.284
<v Speaker 1>retake not a city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a neighborhood in a city that was </v>

6
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:26.464
<v Speaker 1>held by a few hundred rebels armed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kalashnikovs hunting rifles and maybe a </v>

7
00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:30.334
<v Speaker 1>few pistols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't sound to me like the </v>

8
00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:33.370
<v Speaker 1>mightiest army in the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

9
00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:35.540
<v Speaker 1>this notion of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it's air defense systems,</v>

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.390
<v Speaker 1>we haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't hit on that point yet,</v>

11
00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:40.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's been alluded to a especially by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>

12
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.040
<v Speaker 1>This is a can I just make this move?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a country that was invaded.</v>

13
00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:45.874
<v Speaker 1>It's airspace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was invaded three times by the Israelis </v>

14
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:51.550
<v Speaker 1>in the last 20 years and one shot was </v>
<v Speaker 1>fired against Israeli planes.</v>

15
00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Not One plane was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was shot down.</v>

16
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.243
<v Speaker 1>And remember one of those sorties </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved the destruction of a nuclear </v>

17
00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:57.184
<v Speaker 1>facility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one even knew Bashar Al Assad was </v>

18
00:00:58.331 --> 00:00:59.470
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

19
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I take it very skeptically that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>air defense systems,</v>

20
00:01:02.231 --> 00:01:04.930
<v Speaker 1>that their military capabilities are </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite so robust.</v>

21
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I quite agree with Paul on that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

22
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 1>and military defectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll back you up on this.</v>

23
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.440
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the paper tiger argument.</v>

24
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Smith have a strong Syrian army is </v>
<v Speaker 2>simply ridiculous.</v>

25
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.610
<v Speaker 2>This is not an a national army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a sectarian killing machine that</v>

26
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:27.611
<v Speaker 2>has been founded by the ads and that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been sustained and given a soccer by the</v>

27
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 2>secretary and regime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex is 2 million hardcore supporters.</v>

28
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.003
<v Speaker 2>This is a country of 23 million plus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you have a civil war between 2 </v>

29
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 2>million people and 18 million?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

30
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:41.444
<v Speaker 2>I mean the numbers don't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second thing is that this is an army </v>

31
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:45.884
<v Speaker 2>that is a conscript army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that means that people are forced to </v>

32
00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:50.354
<v Speaker 2>serve in the army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those who are serving in the army are </v>

33
00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:53.564
<v Speaker 2>mainly from the dispossessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So knee working class as Malik </v>

34
00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:57.464
<v Speaker 2>described,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would do anything to affect the </v>

35
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:02.960
<v Speaker 2>price of depiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I just said,</v>

36
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.823
<v Speaker 2>is intolerably high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is what needs to be aided </v>

37
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.113
<v Speaker 2>because no one is going to die for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>assads from this point on because they </v>

38
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:14.414
<v Speaker 2>understand now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the propaganda and propaganda </v>

39
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:19.880
<v Speaker 2>does work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Syrians have 42 years of it.</v>

40
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.040
<v Speaker 2>It does work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does brainwash people.</v>

41
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Despite the propaganda people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning to understand that a regime,</v>

42
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:28.880
<v Speaker 2>the torches children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gang rapes,</v>

43
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:33.881
<v Speaker 2>girls have 10 by official order that </v>
<v Speaker 2>trades in the organs of prisoners is not</v>

44
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:38.660
<v Speaker 2>a regime that you want to die for.</v>
