00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.923
<v Speaker 1>I don't think for a second the Kissinger</v>
<v Speaker 1>would support a British exit from the </v>

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor would I,</v>

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>but the reason why he would be skeptical</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

4
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:14.874
<v Speaker 1>it's probably rather different from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical reasons that are put forward </v>

5
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>these days in the debate because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not really about economics,</v>

6
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:23.334
<v Speaker 1>which is conventionally how we tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate these things are the argument </v>

7
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:27.054
<v Speaker 1>here is a strategic one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain is still one of the world's </v>

8
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.680
<v Speaker 1>powers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not a great part,</v>

9
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:34.514
<v Speaker 1>but still a significant power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the European Union allows it to </v>

10
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:38.484
<v Speaker 1>magnify its power and this is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think is an undeniable fact and </v>

11
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>without it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Britain would be much diminished</v>

12
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:51.471
<v Speaker 1>in the realm of foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to understand what it's like</v>

13
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:52.614
<v Speaker 1>to be a European country outside the EU,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a trip to Switzerland and ask them </v>

14
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>how it's going to be part of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but have no vote.</v>

15
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Have no say so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>

16
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:04.434
<v Speaker 1>my own sense is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not trying to second guess </v>

17
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:07.614
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that world order strongly implies a </v>

18
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>British membership of the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

19
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>there's an angler file strand to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kissinger.</v>

20
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>He had from an early age and early </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>

21
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.353
<v Speaker 1>very good friends in this country </v>
<v Speaker 1>ranging across the political spectrum </v>

22
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>from the great historian Michael Howard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Dennis Ed.</v>

23
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>When he came to Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kissinger really meant he came to France</v>

24
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>to Germany and to Great Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He spent relatively little time in other</v>

25
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>countries except occasional trips to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italy,</v>

26
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.853
<v Speaker 1>but his view of Europe I think was one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that combined and understanding of the </v>

27
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 1>need for Britain to be engaged with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe and and understanding that Europe</v>

28
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>security was very much a factor for </v>
<v Speaker 1>NATO.</v>

29
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 1>So my sense is that the whole argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most recent book he wrote,</v>

30
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>World Order is that Europe is itself a </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

31
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's a power that must reform </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

32
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a power that risks impotence </v>
<v Speaker 1>through its own internal entanglements,</v>

33
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>its own internal internal complexities </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole point.</v>

34
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:15.354
<v Speaker 1>I think if the government strategies is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to argue for reform of Europe rather </v>

35
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>than than for exit from it.</v>
