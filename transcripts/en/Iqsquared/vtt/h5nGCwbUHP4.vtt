00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.323
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea of a Scandinavian </v>
<v Speaker 1>entitles lead to have a mill </v>

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.720
<v Speaker 1>democratized and Monica and my argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>is simple.</v>

3
00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:10.720
<v Speaker 1>If we are to be a modern country in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>21st century,</v>

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.320
<v Speaker 1>part of various global alliances and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trading blocks and so on,</v>

5
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.160
<v Speaker 1>we have to have institutions that match </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Melbourne position,</v>

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>fortune as a half grown stented </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>

7
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:22.924
<v Speaker 1>We take pride in being the mother of </v>
<v Speaker 1>parliaments and yet we still have a lot </v>

8
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.670
<v Speaker 1>of our constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This institution which is hereditary,</v>

9
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:32.710
<v Speaker 1>backward looking medieval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

10
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.563
<v Speaker 1>Some of the PR is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The forthcoming now reading will excite </v>

11
00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:42.070
<v Speaker 1>people and be no doubt there will be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big outpouring of jury on the day,</v>

12
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.930
<v Speaker 1>but underneath that is the hidden wiring</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the constitution where there are road</v>

13
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Paris exercise both by the Mahler </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kendall said by the ministers.</v>

14
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.393
<v Speaker 1>There is a very obscure system of </v>
<v Speaker 1>financing the royal family which the </v>

15
00:00:54.851 --> 00:00:57.080
<v Speaker 1>public doesn't understand and isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>privy to it.</v>

16
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the question of the Commonwealth</v>

17
00:00:59.621 --> 00:01:01.750
<v Speaker 1>and why the Queen is head of all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries,</v>

18
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.883
<v Speaker 1>a form of colonial countries out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question of the Church of England and </v>

19
00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:07.774
<v Speaker 1>why it is that the queen or her </v>
<v Speaker 1>successes are in charge of the </v>

20
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:12.124
<v Speaker 1>Protestant church in the United Kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so under these issues need to be </v>

21
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 1>ventilated as we move to the road is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect opportunity.</v>

22
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.193
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't come as a threat to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>monarchy to have people to say it needs </v>

23
00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:25.210
<v Speaker 1>to be modernized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

24
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 1>the only genuine world tradition is </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

25
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Real real wisdom requires modernization </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a whole minutes.</v>

26
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.950
<v Speaker 1>To summarize your</v>
<v Speaker 1>21 century,</v>

27
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.820
<v Speaker 1>a</v>
<v Speaker 1>science fiction,</v>

28
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.603
<v Speaker 1>a festival of a bitch is an example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy around the world and in </v>

29
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>particular on the culture down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

30
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.040
<v Speaker 1>got</v>
<v Speaker 1>good shots to from the monarchy.</v>

31
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.363
<v Speaker 1>He's not under his jurisdiction a pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the separation between the power and </v>

32
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.630
<v Speaker 1>for my interview view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monarchy most change by in and spoke</v>

33
00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:25.960
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a politician.</v>

34
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.143
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
