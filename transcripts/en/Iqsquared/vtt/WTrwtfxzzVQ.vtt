00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>The National Health Service would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>marvelous if they were not political </v>

2
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:05.034
<v Speaker 1>interference so everybody knows the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and they all send know what the </v>

3
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>solution is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The solution is decentralization,</v>

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.810
<v Speaker 1>give power back to the hospitals and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors because the secret of the NHS,</v>

5
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>very curious secret is that it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely perverse structure.</v>

6
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.463
<v Speaker 1>You'll see it's set up as a hierarchical</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization of bureaucracy such that </v>

7
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:37.881
<v Speaker 1>the wisdom at the top filters down </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the instruments in the middle to</v>

8
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>achieve the effect you want to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom.</v>

9
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Armies are perfect examples of that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what Britain did during the war.</v>

10
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>It's were of course the way in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>armies are organized.</v>

11
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>It's the way in which governments are </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized.</v>

12
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.573
<v Speaker 1>The point about armies is that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>run by generals and the generals have </v>

13
00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>the brains and the experience to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they are doing.</v>

14
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:01.044
<v Speaker 1>So an army is a perfect example of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>organism in which the brains are at the </v>

15
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:06.774
<v Speaker 1>top and filter through to the actions </v>
<v Speaker 1>down below if the general is there any </v>

16
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:10.884
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The National Health Service is the most </v>

17
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 1>peculiar structure in which the brains </v>
<v Speaker 1>are at the bottom.</v>

18
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say at the top,</v>

19
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.580
<v Speaker 1>you have amateurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>

20
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>determining these things.</v>

21
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>And at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least near the bottom,</v>

22
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.183
<v Speaker 1>you have the doctors and the nurses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the technicians who actually know </v>

23
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>something about what is necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve the problems.</v>
