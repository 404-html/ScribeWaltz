<v Speaker 1>When raw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rose to fight aids.</v>

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.473
<v Speaker 1>The foes we sprang to work and will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Laurie gave to drake the wave she </v>

3
00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:16.934
<v Speaker 1>gave to us the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the hill on which Harris </v>

4
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:23.720
<v Speaker 1>standards so they could look down on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people below.</v>

5
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.030
<v Speaker 1>In every sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking back on it,</v>

6
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.903
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes feel that the only one of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporaries at school who hasn't yet </v>

7
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:29.864
<v Speaker 1>been to jail is mark Faccia and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>for want of trying the Stanford </v>

8
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.643
<v Speaker 1>Education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many of our schools is so poor that </v>

9
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:43.301
<v Speaker 1>if you happen to go to a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your privileged and at the heart of this</v>

10
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:46.130
<v Speaker 1>debate is the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is privilege a bad thing?</v>

11
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.263
<v Speaker 1>Is it a bad thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about if that privilege has been </v>

12
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.610
<v Speaker 1>ernt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about if that privilege meet simply</v>

13
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:55.700
<v Speaker 1>means going to a better school than </v>
<v Speaker 1>average?</v>

14
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.060
<v Speaker 1>And what about if the word that is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>used as privileged,</v>

15
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 1>when what we really mean is successful?</v>

16
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.103
<v Speaker 2>Of all those brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliantly educated young people honed </v>

17
00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 2>to perfection in the white heat of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>crucible of excellence,</v>

18
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 2>who's bought education buys them the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best jobs in those monuments to selfless</v>

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.380
<v Speaker 2>wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The media,</v>
