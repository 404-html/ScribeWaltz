<v Speaker 1>Let me remind you of the votes as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>came in.</v>

2
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:16.623
<v Speaker 1>51 don't knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gone to home to 10 and then we </v>

3
00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:26.221
<v Speaker 1>had 119 four and 84 against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're now at 127 against.</v>

4
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.980
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done a pretty good job,</v>

5
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>but not quite good enough with 139 </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeing with the motion.</v>

6
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
