<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>one point 2 billion people are still in </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme poverty.</v>

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.463

<v Speaker 1>affecting people's health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their self esteem,</v>

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>and their ability to participate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>society and connect with other people.</v>

10
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.083
<v Speaker 1>It also hampers development by reducing </v>
<v Speaker 1>society's capacity to innovate and </v>

11
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:55.731
<v Speaker 1>promote progress.</v>

13
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>sustainability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inclusiveness,</v>
