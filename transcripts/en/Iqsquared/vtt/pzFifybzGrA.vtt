1
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.880
<v Speaker 1>But a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good evening to you,</v>

2
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:19.714
<v Speaker 1>delighted to have professor Stiglitz </v>
<v Speaker 1>with us and it's fantastic that </v>

3
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.340
<v Speaker 1>economics can put in such a big crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.620
<v Speaker 1>British economist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pretty good,</v>

5
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by global standards,</v>

6
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:33.220
<v Speaker 1>American economists to somehow more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

7
00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:34.054
<v Speaker 1>I always tend to think they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a tradition of saying things </v>

8
00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:37.444
<v Speaker 1>that people can understand writing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers being polemical and </v>

9
00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
<v Speaker 1>and also winning Nobel prizes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Stiglitz is in this tradition.</v>

11
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.380
<v Speaker 1>He's written this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the latest of his books,</v>

12
00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:52.450
<v Speaker 1>highly readable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.870
<v Speaker 1>from the foyer I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>but he's also worked in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 1>the sort of real worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the World Bank,</v>

17
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>the Clinton administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.773
<v Speaker 1>but he's achieved top academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction with a Nobel prize which he </v>

19
00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:12.841
<v Speaker 1>got with several others for spotting </v>
<v Speaker 1>something quite important in economics.</v>

20
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.193
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and indeed in life that information is </v>

21
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.603
<v Speaker 1>extremely important and that markets </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't always work well when information </v>

22
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.240
<v Speaker 1>is unequally distributed.</v>

23
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.950
<v Speaker 1>If a lender doesn't know how reliable </v>
<v Speaker 1>that borrower is,</v>

24
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.970
<v Speaker 1>the market for loans may not work well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

25
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:36.520
<v Speaker 1>that's something that might perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound a bit obvious now,</v>

26
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.473
<v Speaker 1>but the arguments are quite subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's around the fact that if bad </v>

27
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:43.990
<v Speaker 1>borrowers are the ones who have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inclination to borrow because they don't</v>

28
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.933
<v Speaker 1>tend to pay the loans back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole market for loans can be </v>

29
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:48.964
<v Speaker 1>screwed up and it's similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arguments have been applied to </v>

30
00:01:50.531 --> 00:01:51.364
<v Speaker 1>secondhand cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similar arguments apply in the labor </v>

31
00:01:54.071 --> 00:01:59.071
<v Speaker 1>market to those arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They reshaped economics in the 1970s and</v>

32
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:00.544
<v Speaker 1>eighties and Joe Stiglitz is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>three men who gained recognition for </v>

33
00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:05.164
<v Speaker 1>them at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a professor at the Columbia </v>

34
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.553
<v Speaker 1>Business School in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also chairs the Brooks World Poverty </v>

35
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Institute at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Manchester.</v>

36
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so good academic good policy maker.</v>

37
00:02:15.731 --> 00:02:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't want to put British </v>
<v Speaker 1>economist is down.</v>

38
00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 1>We did have the greatest the world has </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen in John Maynard Keynes,</v>

39
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.143
<v Speaker 1>but the Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid even how the most fluent </v>

40
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 1>followers of Keynes these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Joseph Stiglitz is one of those like</v>

41
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.790
<v Speaker 1>a formed a format for tonight's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be very simple.</v>

42
00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:33.220
<v Speaker 1>He's going to speak for up to 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

43
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:34.930
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will stop him,</v>

44
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

45
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I will talk to him a little bit up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have some conversation up here and</v>

46
00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:45.340
<v Speaker 1>then we will take questions from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>floor,</v>

47
00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 1>but let's get straight on and welcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor Joseph stickler.</v>

48
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.910
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
