<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Savior or destroyer that neither.</v>

2
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's going to make any </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant difference.</v>

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Don remitting only interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>I am prodigious Lee uninterested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>medium.</v>

5
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.380
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is just another way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing things down.</v>

6
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Citizen Journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it sounds so wonderful.</v>

7
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like something from the French</v>
<v Speaker 1>Revolution,</v>

8
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 1>do you want a citizen dentist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our media,</v>

10
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:39.854
<v Speaker 1>our publications at the moment are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wash with highly paid columnist who by </v>

11
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 1>and large have nothing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very little.</v>

13
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

14
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Four of the largest of the top 10 new </v>
<v Speaker 2>sites on the way are aggregators.</v>

15
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>AOL,</v>

16
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Yahoo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Microsoft.</v>

17
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.640
<v Speaker 2>They don't generate news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They collect other people's news.</v>

18
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Rupert Murdoch has now declared war on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Google.</v>

19
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 2>It's not Google's fault that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>was so stupid.</v>

20
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.053
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he is going to progressively put </v>

21
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.890
<v Speaker 2>more and more of his content behind what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call a pay wall.</v>

22
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 2>And I welcome that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I hope a lot of other proprietors,</v>

23
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.953
<v Speaker 2>we'll do the same.</v>

24
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.893
<v Speaker 1>The big get bigger in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these kind of perpetual declines and </v>

25
00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:24.310
<v Speaker 1>obviously the smaller quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>titles are the ones that have a greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble hanging on.</v>

27
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.210
<v Speaker 2>There's always some financial basis for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this work.</v>

28
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.073
<v Speaker 2>It's not free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason is it takes an enormous </v>

29
00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Speaker 2>amount of time to produce very good </v>
<v Speaker 2>content and money.</v>

30
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.283
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the comments at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of articles on newspaper </v>

31
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.900
<v Speaker 1>websites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are awesome.</v>

32
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean they are properly knuckle </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragging.</v>

33
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Most of the stuff that comes on chat </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooms and on blogs,</v>

34
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>it's beyond corporate and Sinead is </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiocy.</v>

35
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.973
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you or relate to the reader in a </v>

36
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I used to write for magazines,</v>

37
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>you would publish your article and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>some letters that would come in the mail</v>

38
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:10.344
<v Speaker 1>a week later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by which point you'd totally moved on </v>

39
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:12.894
<v Speaker 1>and forgotten about the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course most people didn't bother </v>

40
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>to write it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

41
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:18.890
<v Speaker 1>within an hour of anything I publish on </v>
<v Speaker 1>slate.</v>

42
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.783
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are hundreds of comments and now </v>

43
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:24.390
<v Speaker 1>that we've sort of gotten better at </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to do comments,</v>

44
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>it's quite a good conversation that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in and I depend on that.</v>

45
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:29.544
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't write to speak from on high to </v>

46
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>an invisible audience.</v>

47
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I write to relate to an audience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

48
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.323
<v Speaker 1>many of whom I start to know and </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize because they're so responsive </v>

49
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>to what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's reviews on the Nasher incredibly</v>

50
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people follow them.</v>

51
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are written by theater </v>
<v Speaker 1>producers.</v>

52
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't they be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think someone's going to say,</v>

53
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:57.810
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that because I put money into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the production.</v>

54
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>The question about news generation on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thin news day,</v>

55
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.700
<v Speaker 1>do we make it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

56
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>we don't make it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

57
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>we eke it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can put up and we,</v>

58
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.083
<v Speaker 1>we look at on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we spin it out and we generally sort of </v>

59
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:16.190
<v Speaker 1>stuff it forward a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't absolutely make it up.</v>
