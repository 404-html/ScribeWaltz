00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.500
<v Speaker 1>What did the Romans do to democracy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friends,</v>

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.323
<v Speaker 1>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They abolished it in favor of a </v>

3
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:10.464
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the imperial system and why with </v>

4
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>the word Raymond's not much good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.433
<v Speaker 1>Why won't they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much interested in drama where the </v>

6
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:17.964
<v Speaker 1>tragic or comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's fundamentally the whole </v>

7
00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:26.470
<v Speaker 1>audience was forever being dragged off </v>
<v Speaker 1>to another entertainment,</v>

8
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.573
<v Speaker 1>the games and watching people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals being smothered in a dupree </v>

9
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.490
<v Speaker 1>ritual that was endemic in the Roman </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and virtually absent from Greece.</v>

10
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.503
<v Speaker 1>How many people died in that building </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is emblematic still a raymond </v>

11
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:43.420
<v Speaker 1>culture and civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The called the coliseum.</v>

12
00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:46.840
<v Speaker 1>How many people were killed in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably 200,000.</v>

13
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>The Greeks like the happy release of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>theater,</v>

14
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.993
<v Speaker 1>the Roman idea of good family </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment was cutting the feet of </v>

15
00:00:58.211 --> 00:01:03.211
<v Speaker 1>some poor fif coating his stumps with </v>
<v Speaker 1>honey and letting the bas do the rest,</v>

16
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.503
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in many ways the Romans were </v>

17
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.203
<v Speaker 1>Boston's</v>
<v Speaker 1>whipped and brutalized as children that </v>

18
00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:12.424
<v Speaker 1>they'd like to inflict pain themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the most famous image from all </v>

19
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.973
<v Speaker 1>the frescoes of pompey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the women whipping each </v>

20
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:19.810
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

21
00:01:19.811 --> 00:01:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Importance in terrorists instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>

22
00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:26.971
<v Speaker 1>People hate to be float.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a society not based on democracy,</v>

23
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.900
<v Speaker 1>but on fear.</v>
