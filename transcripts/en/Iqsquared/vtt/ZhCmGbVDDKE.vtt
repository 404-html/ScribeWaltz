1
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.363
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good evening ladies and gentlemen and </v>

2
00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the meet in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwich.</v>

3
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.233
<v Speaker 1>My first thing is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please turn off your mobile phones </v>

4
00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:33.131
<v Speaker 1>because it was always someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgets we get a bit of old or Beethoven</v>

5
00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:35.180
<v Speaker 1>or they're not hearing tune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very distracting.</v>

6
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.403
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure you don't lose these in the </v>

7
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:41.420
<v Speaker 1>course of the debate because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to need them to vote at the end,</v>

8
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>nor should you tear them in half because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are going to vote,</v>

9
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:46.004
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to put those in together or </v>

10
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.693
<v Speaker 1>looking forward to a very lively </v>
<v Speaker 1>interchange from the between the panel </v>

11
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:53.864
<v Speaker 1>on the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sharpen your wits and make notes of </v>

12
00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:57.524
<v Speaker 1>anything you find that is either </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly excellent you want to </v>

13
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:03.320
<v Speaker 1>amplify or particularly annoying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to rebut.</v>

14
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Your time will come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can read,</v>

15
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.731
<v Speaker 1>not going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

16
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>that was a consequence of the empire or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

17
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.490
<v Speaker 1>You're going to read so I'm not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give very long biographies.</v>

18
00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:16.910
<v Speaker 1>I should just introduce the speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very briefly,</v>

19
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:21.560
<v Speaker 1>but I would urge you please to buy all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the books on sale outside.</v>

20
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:24.680
<v Speaker 1>They all make ideal Christmas presents </v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

21
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:25.514
<v Speaker 1>it's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nicest thing for the speaker after </v>

22
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.010
<v Speaker 1>the emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they haven't,</v>

23
00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to be besieged by people saying,</v>

24
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.450
<v Speaker 1>please can you sign this copy of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book or even better copies of the book.</v>

25
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>The emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>is Britain's former colonies should stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>blaming the empire for their ills.</v>

27
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.270
<v Speaker 1>And one can debate that a little bit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the terms.</v>

28
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:52.271
<v Speaker 1>What exactly do we mean by our colony is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Scotland commonly is arland economy is</v>

29
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.283
<v Speaker 1>corn will accompany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>France might used to be British at one </v>

30
00:01:56.511 --> 00:01:57.500
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least bits of it.</v>
