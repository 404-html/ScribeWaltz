1
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Impartiality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the question and those precisely</v>

2
00:00:03.891 --> 00:00:05.840
<v Speaker 1>what it costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows exactly what it is.</v>

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.903
<v Speaker 1>what he's getting at is this notion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite is festering away in his </v>

5
00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>mind that the BBC is partial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.970
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the BBC is not monolithic,</v>

7
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 1>so therefore it is not partial that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people who work for,</v>

8
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.020
<v Speaker 1>to take one of you that are those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who worked with you take another view.</v>

9
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you asked you,</v>

10
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:26.414
<v Speaker 1>you've made it rather more personal than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that than you asked me about my </v>

11
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.480
<v Speaker 1>impartiality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I can tell you sir,</v>

12
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.403
<v Speaker 1>is that I've been doing this job on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Today program for 27 years and I have </v>

13
00:00:38.631 --> 00:00:41.360
<v Speaker 1>been accused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of them</v>

14
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.783
<v Speaker 1>being unfair to all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hope that continues because I </v>

15
00:00:49.391 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's,</v>

16
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:50.721
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

17
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:51.554
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a rather crude and clumsy way of </v>

18
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:54.470
<v Speaker 1>measuring impartiality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

19
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>but I reckon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

22
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.983
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one moment you're being a attacked by </v>

23
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:02.054
<v Speaker 1>the Labor Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Conservative Party to other </v>

24
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.040
<v Speaker 1>poisoning the well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the democratic debate,</v>

25
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:09.950
<v Speaker 1>which is what a certain Jonathan Econ </v>
<v Speaker 1>who subsequently went to jail,</v>

26
00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:14.951
<v Speaker 1>but we'll put that to one side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said it said about me and uh,</v>

27
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.540
<v Speaker 1>and then praise by the third party </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously,</v>

29
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously for saving democracy on </v>
<v Speaker 1>behalf of the great relationship.</v>

30
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:24.294
<v Speaker 1>Then when the Labor party came to power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you find that actually </v>

31
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.313
<v Speaker 1>as they said and left the BBC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something must be done about the John </v>

32
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.991
<v Speaker 1>Humphrey's problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

33
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way it's,</v>

34
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.490
<v Speaker 1>it's politics for God's sake and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be able to enough and ugly enough</v>

35
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:35.324
<v Speaker 1>to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would ask as for whether it's the </v>

36
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>fault of the BBC or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

37
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.230
<v Speaker 1>obviously you think it is the fault with</v>
<v Speaker 1>BBC,</v>

38
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>whatever the full happens to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I was held entirely serious here.</v>

39
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.710
<v Speaker 1>I put aside what the Today program does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people like it,</v>

40
00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:49.544
<v Speaker 1>some don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The BBC is ibelieve immensely important </v>

41
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.143
<v Speaker 1>to this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I struggled to imagine this country </v>

42
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.330
<v Speaker 1>without the BBC for all it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>

43
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.410
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many folds.</v>

44
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a great civilizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tuition and I hope it survives.</v>

45
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.120
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
