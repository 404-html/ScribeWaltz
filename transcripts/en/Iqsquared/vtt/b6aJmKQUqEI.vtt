1
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>There is a fundamental anthropologic </v>
<v Speaker 1>will need for physical shopping.</v>

2
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think the high street is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going anywhere anytime soon,</v>

3
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.823
<v Speaker 1>but I think shopping has evolved over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the years and it will continue to </v>

4
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technology does represent,</v>

5
00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>I think a chance for a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>change in the nature of the high street.</v>

6
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>We all seen dramatic change in high </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets in town centers.</v>

7
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>That means they are never ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the way they,</v>

8
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.450
<v Speaker 1>that will always be the bookies and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>charity shops,</v>

9
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under greg's on high street.</v>

10
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.653
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

11
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>most of us that have that traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>retailers will migrate online.</v>

12
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>We're definitely not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the high street,</v>

13
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.573
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a place to have online </v>

14
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:04.640
<v Speaker 1>shopping and the high street for </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

15
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:07.010
<v Speaker 1>electronics or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll buy it online,</v>

16
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.883
<v Speaker 1>but for some things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not just makeup and perfume and </v>

17
00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

18
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.053
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you want to go and see if it </v>

19
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:13.580
<v Speaker 1>works with your skin or that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>side of things.</v>

20
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.473
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the convenience of being at my </v>

21
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:20.060
<v Speaker 1>house or my office and seeing literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything at the world available for me</v>

22
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:20.894
<v Speaker 1>to look up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of these debates are around the </v>

23
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:23.564
<v Speaker 1>idea of the high street as this really </v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgic view of the single </v>

24
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:28.574
<v Speaker 1>thoroughfare that families would go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a Saturday afternoon and do all of </v>

25
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:36.551
<v Speaker 1>that shopping and that genuinely doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflect the state of the world.</v>

26
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it depends what you mean by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>high streets.</v>

27
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.363
<v Speaker 1>I mean a physical straight down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of a town potentially is under </v>

28
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 1>massive threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but physical retail,</v>

29
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:48.684
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're going to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>test of it at all and also in that role </v>

30
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:51.750
<v Speaker 1>still be in the middle of town.</v>

31
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.453
<v Speaker 1>I think you've raised some really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting points and now jump up </v>

32
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.363
<v Speaker 1>farther and do further research or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a really good opening </v>

33
00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 1>to the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very interesting.</v>

34
00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:17.251
<v Speaker 1>It's very controversial at times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought more boring for discussion and</v>

35
00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:18.934
<v Speaker 1>divide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got me thinking with you about a few </v>

36
00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:23.740
<v Speaker 1>other things that I thought were maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>not employed right now or not.</v>

37
00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Kind of talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to me about,</v>

38
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>and we're thinking about Ebay is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a store I think is,</v>

39
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

40
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>good as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>as an online entity in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also works well with offline.</v>

43
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Some of the offerings that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like our relationship with our gos,</v>

44
00:02:40.631 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>which reinforces the High Street and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives people an extra option that,</v>

45
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of positively influences the,</v>

46
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.023
<v Speaker 1>the high street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

48
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I think the high street is just in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of rebirth rather than,</v>

49
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than any demise.</v>
