1
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.983
<v Speaker 1>We got to discuss the debate in the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashioned one against that will be time </v>

2
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.990
<v Speaker 1>for you to ask questions to the panel</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the motion.</v>

3
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.083
<v Speaker 1>So the motion tonight is whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the market is the best judge of good </v>

4
00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:43.300
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now being an awkward,</v>

5
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.623
<v Speaker 1>I would say that I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should find out what is art </v>

6
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:49.783
<v Speaker 1>market fellows now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sounds rather he supposedly worth </v>

7
00:00:53.591 --> 00:00:57.910
<v Speaker 1>about 6 billion euros in the UK sales </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone every year,</v>

8
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.560
<v Speaker 1>although I don't know how much tax he </v>
<v Speaker 1>pays on that.</v>

9
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.363
<v Speaker 1>We have at least 10 outfits and the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks to thank for them as well as </v>

10
00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:06.514
<v Speaker 1>the options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a grumpy fellow audrick to </v>

11
00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:13.870
<v Speaker 1>this week who claimed that it was absurd</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the banking crisis.</v>

12
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.530
<v Speaker 1>His paintings might sell for anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>between two and 9 million pounds,</v>

13
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.083
<v Speaker 1>but let's not forget where we are in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>house of one of this country's most </v>

14
00:01:22.661 --> 00:01:25.570
<v Speaker 1>influential art collectors and taste </v>
<v Speaker 1>makers,</v>

15
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 1>inventors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>

16
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>So part of the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does the money work of our commands make</v>

17
00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 1>it better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to help us answer this question,</v>

18
00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:42.580
<v Speaker 1>we have a very distinguished panel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd like to find out from you,</v>

19
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we get going,</v>

20
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.783
<v Speaker 1>quick show of hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who thinks that is the best judge of </v>

21
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:52.360
<v Speaker 1>good things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put your hands up now on two,</v>

22
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:53.194
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four?</v>

23
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.183
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.930
<v Speaker 1>And who wouldn't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who wouldn't agree?</v>

25
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell.</v>

26
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Satya said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you leave the building</v>

27
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.170
<v Speaker 1>and I think in order to try and convince</v>
<v Speaker 1>you otherwise,</v>

28
00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:15.004
<v Speaker 1>we have a very esteemed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to invite the first speaker up </v>

29
00:02:18.461 --> 00:02:19.294
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
