Speaker 1:          00:08          I'm Jonathan Friedland from the Guardian. And great pleasure to be moderating or chairing perhaps is more appropriate word. Um, our speakers and our debate for tonight, as you know, the motion before us is the best chance for peace between Israel and Palestine is for Uncle Sam to butt out and American colloquialism. Uh, despite this being a intelligence squared in London and so much has been going on in the whole, the wider Middle East across the Arab world in particular, the so called Arab spring, the Arab awakening, depending on how you prefer to call it, that people on both sides of the Israel Palestine conflict, uh, who said some might accuse of being almost addicted to the attention of the world have been slightly feeling left out in recent months. Um, because the, uh, attention has moved away, uh, nevertheless, that conflict does still go on. Um, and it's that one very particular aspect of it that we want to explore tonight.

Speaker 1:          01:07          We are going to be doing something different in this debate from some debates on this conflict that you may have heard before. And it's different in this sense. We're not aiming for perhaps sometimes what can be accrued debate which pits Israelis against Palestinians or even friends of Israel against friends of the Palestinians. Uh, rather, all four speakers tonight would insist that they are looking for solutions for indeed resolution rather than simply defending one side or the other. Nevertheless, within that framework or within that context, uh, there are, um, we will hope they are revealed tonight substantial disagreements between them about how best to achieve that, uh, resolution. Uh, they are for people who are in their own different ways, dedicate much of their professional lives to wrestling with this subject and they do it with huge commitment. Um, so I think we're very, very lucky to have them and I'm going to introduce them all one by one as they come up to speak.

Speaker 1:          02:06          But first of all, I just want to, um, mention something that you will have been doing, uh, already, which is costing your pre vote. I'm going to give you the result of that. The vote that you walked in with the vote before, you'd had a chance to be swayed by the almost scissor Romanian rhetoric that is going to be unleashed, uh, from this panel. Um, but there will be, you will cost a final vote later on. And the way that works is you'll have one of these cards if you want to vote for you, tear off the four bit. If you want to bet against you, turn off the against bit. And if you are an abstention, you slipped the entire card into a ballot box, almost Vladimir Putin, esc, where method of voting. Um, but we're going to have a very proper in democratic result, uh, beef, uh, in contrast to their IPAD apps. Um, so we're going to do that. Uh, that's the format and uh, the rest of it, I'm going to explain more or less as we go on. There is a little new twist in the intelligence squared format, which I hope you're going to enjoy it. Uh, which we'll come to later.
