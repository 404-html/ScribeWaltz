Speaker 1:          00:00          I know we only still sort of the house were absolutely in favor of character education, but I am slightly worried at the moment of some of the some of the noise I'm hearing about perhaps grading character or assessing character and using character education as the means of assessing pupils and most are absolutely in favor of teaching character. The measurement of parents when it's in its infancy and one of the main researchers in this field, Angela Duckworth has said that such measurements are not ready for any serious kind of high stakes to use. If we did end up grading pupils on character and using such great for anything significant, that I guarantee you that it will become effectively another middle class ramp away for the underachieving children of middle class professionals to gain the system in their favor. If we get rid of tests, we will inevitably end up depending more on assessment which disadvantages the already disadvantaged and reinforces prevailing stereotypes.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Now, in the not too recent past, these patterns were much better understood than they are today. In the 19th century, the civil service reform was Charles Northcote and Stafford Trevelyan. For so long battle to make entry to the Civil Service based on merit rather than family connections in the early 20th century. Pioneering Labor education is such as our external who trusts you mentioned and Beatrice and Sydney web for an education system based around exams. Rh Tony didn't just believe as truth remotely said in the amounts of Patriot power of education. He believed in the emancipator he power of exams because he thought the only exams could ensure that underprivileged children were treated fairly. Only exams could counter entrenched privilege. Very little has changed since then. If anything, we have more research to back up. Tony's. You, uh, exams are still the Ferris means of assessment. And if you care about meritocracy, social mobility and fairness, then you must be in favor of them.
