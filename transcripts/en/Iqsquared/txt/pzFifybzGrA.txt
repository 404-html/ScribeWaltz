Speaker 1:          00:16          But a very, very good evening to you, delighted to have professor Stiglitz with us and it's fantastic that economics can put in such a big crowd. Um, British economist, a pretty good, uh, by global standards, American economists to somehow more interesting. I always tend to think they, they have a tradition of saying things that people can understand writing in newspapers being polemical and political, uh, and also winning Nobel prizes. Joe Stiglitz is in this tradition. He's written this book, the latest of his books, highly readable, uh, available, uh, from the foyer I should say. Um, but he's also worked in the real world. Well, the sort of real worlds, the World Bank, the Clinton administration. Um, but he's achieved top academic distinction with a Nobel prize which he got with several others for spotting something quite important in economics. Um, and indeed in life that information is extremely important and that markets don't always work well when information is unequally distributed.

Speaker 1:          01:25          If a lender doesn't know how reliable that borrower is, the market for loans may not work well. Now, that's something that might perhaps sound a bit obvious now, but the arguments are quite subtle. It's around the fact that if bad borrowers are the ones who have an inclination to borrow because they don't tend to pay the loans back, the whole market for loans can be screwed up and it's similar. Arguments have been applied to secondhand cars. Similar arguments apply in the labor market to those arguments. They reshaped economics in the 1970s and eighties and Joe Stiglitz is one of the three men who gained recognition for them at the moment. He's a professor at the Columbia Business School in New York. He also chairs the Brooks World Poverty Institute at the University of Manchester. Uh, so good academic good policy maker. Now I don't want to put British economist is down. We did have the greatest the world has ever seen in John Maynard Keynes, but the Americans, I'm afraid even how the most fluent followers of Keynes these days, and Joseph Stiglitz is one of those like a formed a format for tonight's going to be very simple. He's going to speak for up to 15 minutes. At that point, I will stop him, whatever he's saying. Um, I will talk to him a little bit up here. We'll have some conversation up here and then we will take questions from the floor, but let's get straight on and welcome professor Joseph stickler.
