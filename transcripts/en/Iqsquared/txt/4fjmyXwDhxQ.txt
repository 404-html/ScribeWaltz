Speaker 1:          00:00          Now you have a statistic in my book where I mentioned that it was the average income of the parents of our value university undergrad students right now corresponds to the average income of the top two percent of the US distribution of family income. So this doesn't mean that everybody at outcomes from the two percent, you have some people who come from below youtube too, but there are so few and so people who come from the top two are so that the overall average is as if all students had been picked up from them within the top two. I think this is an example where the gap between the official discourse based on meritocracy call opportunity, mobility of us society, et Cetera, et cetera. And the reality is particularly strong. So I think there's a lot of fight crazy basie elite not only in the US but also in my country in France.

Speaker 1:          00:57          You know, we don't have this very high tuition fees, but we are sometimes able to put the five times more public resources in the schools where the children of the elite go to as compared to the. So you know, in every country there's a lot of hypocrisy about equal opportunity and an incredible abilities and time of the elite to justify inequality as fair when it is not fair. And I think what's important is to put all these claims under public scrutiny and to have more transparency, not only about income and wealth, but also about who benefits from what public spendings so that we can adapt our policies.
