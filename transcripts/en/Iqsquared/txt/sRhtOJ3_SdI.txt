Speaker 1:          00:00          The average time a person spends and displacement or refugee spends and displacement to 17 years. That's just the average time. We have people that are born and bred and grow up in refugee camps. The Syrians that have been sitting in Syria, in Jordan, Lebanon and, and then moved on to Turkey, um, have not been able to access the bare minimum of, of subsistence for themselves. We have talked to people that have moved on because they haven't found education, decent education for their children, healthcare. And I think this really speaks to the beginnings of the refugee regime. The refugee regime was crafted in 1951 it was crafted at a time and a place where persecution was the reason for movement. Civil and political rights were privileged over economic, social and cultural rights. The idea of somebody moving because they saw no future for themselves, they saw no future for their family with was somehow put in a second tier. But what we are seeing now is precisely people saying that that's not the way that we can live our lives. We don't have the right to work in Turkey in Jordan. We have no education for our children and no health care. So in a sense, this is what you're seeing. You're seeing the combination of a governance system that is in desperate need of fixing.
