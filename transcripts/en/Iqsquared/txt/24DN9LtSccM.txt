Speaker 1:          00:00          So what is the great challenge or question before us? I think of it as the wall within each one of us. The war between apathy and action. Apathy is very seductive. It is wreathed in false facts. Facts such as there is no progress in Africa. There is no progress anywhere. The is, um, no. All African leaders are corrupt and all aid is wasted. These are holes, facts, the datasets. D datasets do not exist to justify them yet they bounce around unscrutinised they need to be challenged because they're wrong. Against that is the call to action. Not just mindless action, but evidence based action or factor in some call it and that's a growing movement of informed global citizens. You take action based on the facts to change government policies or make informed consumer decisions that result in building on facts of progress. Facts such as we have in fact hearth, extreme poverty.

Speaker 1:          00:55          There are now 9 million people on antiretroviral drugs funded by you. You didn't know that, that you're saving these lives through funding these drugs. Thank you. Malaria deaths, deaths down because of insecticide treated bed nets, again, funded by taxpayer funded eight programs, a smart aid programs, and above all progress generated by great leadership in Africa by some governments in a bubble by citizens in these countries and across the developing world who are demanding better results. The chance we have now is through the Millennium Goals renewed to build on the fact of progress armed citizens across the world with scorecards to measure governments and they're holding them accountable. That is the great prize we have before us to generate this army of, uh, informed global citizens who will build on the facts of progress and avoid terrible facts that could exist by 2030. If we don't get this right, to which world you want and which set of facts do you want to live in by 2030. Thank you.
