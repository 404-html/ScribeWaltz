Speaker 1:          00:00          In the United States, for example, if we take census numbers and if we assume that the homes, the households in the US are going to become a little smaller such as Germany today, the United States will have to build 74 million new homes or the next 40 years, 74 million. This is more than the United Kingdom. France, Canada, and Australia put together has today in pencil halls. This is not China, this is the United States, but now the question is how out of the city going to grow? Everybody agrees today that low density suburbs, which is the characteristic urban net structure, the United States is not convenient for quality of life, our environment, but also most Americans don't want to live in Manhattan either. They don't want to live in high rises, facing a narrow sidewalk on a street full of cars, which is dangerous where people may get killed, which is noisy. So the question is we need to build 74 million new homes in the United States and whatever it is done in the United States would have a huge influence in the rest of the world.

Speaker 1:          01:19          How are they see this going to be billed, so why not think of an American new American safety with which is dense with thousands of miles of greenways and pedestrian only wrote criss crossing in a city which would be offer density with offering the same things that people seek in the suburbs such as green and safe spaces for children to ride bicycles. I radically different design because clearly we are talking about technology. What do we have in suburbs or downtown? Neither one of those works, so we clearly need to think about different urban model, but the second question is not only how, but where are they see this going to be up in the United States. Clearly you should not be billed beyond the existing suburbs far away beyond the exiting sober. So where is, where are these 74 million homes to be built? I would say the obvious answer would be to build demolishing, demolishing thousands, tens of thousands of hectors. I'll make 16 sobers, which where were located? Why is the United States so important? Because this has been an enormous influence on what is to happen all over the world and I see it, I see these only means to our way of life.

Speaker 1:          02:51          So designing a CD will reality signing ways of life,

Speaker 2:          02:58          whatever

Speaker 1:          02:58          we're to do, or the next 40 or 50 years in developing countries will determine the word sustainability, quality of life and happiness for millions. I am absolutely convinced that radically not designs a very different cities are possible. They are very simple. They are politically very difficult, but they could lead us to have cities which are much more sustainable, where people will live much happier lives.
