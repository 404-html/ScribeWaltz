Speaker 1:          00:06          Britain has a long history of inventing brilliant new technologies, processes, and designs, but how do we make sure these innovations translate into money making products, companies and industries? What is needed in today's turbulent economic climate to turn British startups into world beaters?

Securing funding is a real challenge. In a recent survey, more than six out of 10 small businesses said lack of startup capital was the barrier they found hardest to overcome. So what next? In the USA there has been a surge in crowdfunding. The website kickstarter has raised more than $660 million for 43,000 product offerings and over 4 million people have contributed money in the UK exit of based crowd cube has 37,000 registered investors and has raised over 9 million pounds. Venture capital is also important for inspiration. British policy makers could look to Israel, which attracts more than twice as much venture capital per capita than any other country at $170 per person. With this model, Israel has established a world leading high tech startup culture, impressive for a country of just 7 million, but while venture capital and crowd funding are important, big business has a role to play.
