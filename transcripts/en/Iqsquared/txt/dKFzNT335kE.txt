Speaker 1:          00:00          Just let me say a few of the key messages, I mean other people think that you still have to wait for new brakes with technology and I don't think that's the case. We have to existing technologies, but they have to break through and that doesn't come by itself and uncle venture gas and America wasn't a big surprise to everyone say in the last decade, but the first pioneers were already out there trying to develop the technology in the eighties. So it takes a few decades, about three decades for new technology to really come through. And that's a very normal timespan, uh, in the energy industry, this industry to actually have new technologies coming on stream to about one percent market share when it actually becomes competitive with existing incumbents. So bear that in mind three decades before it becomes competitive, another three decades before it actually reaches and notch natural market share.

Speaker 1:          00:50          So it's really Internet intergenerational game. Then the other aspect is something about efficiency. A lot of policy is based on the efficiency that we're going to improve. Saudi has something built in around 15 percent of the next 25 years. But efficiency doesn't come by itself, it has his own dilemmas, policy dilemmas, because you know who's going to pay for it. Because if an end consumer not have the expectation that end consumer price will continuously rise, why would you invest now upfront a lot of money to invest in efficiency while governments normally liked to say that energy should be more affordable and cheaper every day, and here's kind of dichotomy to breach. Another critical technology which we have to really come to grips with. Zoom is carbon capture and sequestration CCS really to decarbonize the power system. I'm afraid if you want a lower carbon system, you can't do without a technological fix called carbon capture and sequestration.
