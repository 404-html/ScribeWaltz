Speaker 1:          00:15          Dirty joke, in Ernst, Lubitsch masterpiece Ninotchka the hero visits a cafeteria and orders coffee without cream, and here is the wonderful lip reply of the waiter. Sorry, we have run out of cream. We only have milk. Can I then bring you coffee without milk? I think it's absolutely a correct answer. It's not the same thing. Coffee without cream or coffee without milk. What you don't get, it's part of the identity of what you do get in what sense? Because if you bring this logic to its extreme, you can also see how a double negation when you don't have just when you do not have, in this case, coffee without cream or milk. The result is not zero, but what another. My last example from popular culture from, I think it's from early nineties, you remember the movie with Ethan Mcgregor before he became a trader when he was still playing a working class.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Guys brassed off the hero accompanies, took her home after their date. A young pretty woman who at the entrance to her flat tells Kim, would you like to come in for a coffee? He answers there is a problem. I don't drink, drink, drink coffee. She retorts with a smile. No problem. I don't have any. What I like is that you know what? You get through this. Double negation is probably the most, not vulgar, but open erotic invitation. Like that's my point. I invite you for a coffee. Then I negate coffee and the result is not zero. The result is beautiful invitation.
