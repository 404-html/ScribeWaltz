Speaker 1:          00:01          The idea that the benefit system perpetuates misery is not something that I'm a stranger to have everyday when I knocked doors as has been highlighted in areas where people are struggling, are in work and are struggling, they will point out their neighbors to me about how they're wrong ends and she never goes out to work and he doesn't go out to work and the kids are in the garden and that was always a perception that there is somebody next door getting something that you are not getting. So I asked the people. My response is always would you swap places? It's so easy for them. You're going out to work their lives really easy. Would you go? Would you swap places? And the answer is all, of course not. So what makes you think those people chose it? Either. What makes you think your life is is so different to theirs that they chose something completely different to you? There are many reasons why people end up with benefits and the lady in the audience has highlighted one of them. We should stop treating these people like they are not like us because one day they will. We all of us will fall and need the benefits system if we haven't already.
