Speaker 1:          00:00          Welcome to today's hot topic from intelligence squared.com who has got it right.

People should be given the right to speak yes to the point where it violates the rights of others. People may be given the right to express their concerns about principles, but not about individual characteristics of people. I personally am grateful and proud to live in a country and to be part of a nation that does not tolerate hate speech. And there's anything I would say that perhaps our restrictions and keeps me in the UK. I've go far enough if I can take this opportunity to respond quickly to some of the things that family.
