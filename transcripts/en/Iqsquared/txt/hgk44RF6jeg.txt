Speaker 1:          00:00          But John, in 1997, the NHS budget was 33 point 5 billion in 2010. It was 115 billion. What's that? Is that not a triplet? You're doing cash to carry. Do it in real terms. You're not going to be used in real terms. I've talked about the NHS budget. Are you talking about cash? Are you talking? You don't talk in real terms, in real terms, budgets. See, this is the whole problem with arguing with this exact problem. My family stays on you. This is the whole problem which the book cuts through every time one says something, which is based on the fact the government publishes the statistics say the government spending on nhs, it seems simple, is 33 point 5 billion and in 2010 is over 110 billion. There is no dispute about that and yet the moment labor people of their rights get a fat, they try and twist and turn it so that, for example, now when Professor Brown eloquently explained the decline of math education in Britain, matthew immediately jumped to say, well, it's because the housing problem. This is the problem.
