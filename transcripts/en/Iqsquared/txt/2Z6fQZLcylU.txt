Speaker 1:          00:06          Internet, Savior or destroyer that neither. I don't think it's going to make any significant difference. Don remitting only interested in the message. I am prodigious Lee uninterested in the medium. The Internet is just another way of writing things down. Citizen Journalism. And it sounds so wonderful. It sounds like something from the French Revolution, isn't it? Um, do you want a citizen dentist? Our media, our publications at the moment are a wash with highly paid columnist who by and large have nothing to say. Uh, no. Very little. Yep.

Speaker 2:          00:47          Four of the largest of the top 10 new sites on the way are aggregators. Google, AOL, Yahoo, Microsoft. They don't generate news. They collect other people's news. Rupert Murdoch has now declared war on Google. It's not Google's fault that everyone was so stupid. Ah, and he is going to progressively put more and more of his content behind what we call a pay wall. And I welcome that. And I hope a lot of other proprietors, we'll do the same.

Speaker 1:          01:17          The big get bigger in, in these kind of perpetual declines and obviously the smaller quality, uh, titles are the ones that have a greater trouble hanging on.

Speaker 2:          01:27          There's always some financial basis for this work. It's not free. And the reason is it takes an enormous amount of time to produce very good content and money.

Speaker 1:          01:38          If you look at the comments at the bottom of articles on newspaper websites, they are awesome. I mean they are properly knuckle dragging. Most of the stuff that comes on chat rooms and on blogs, it's beyond corporate and Sinead is idiocy. You, you or relate to the reader in a fundamentally different way. When I used to write for magazines, you would publish your article and maybe some letters that would come in the mail a week later, by which point you'd totally moved on and forgotten about the subject. And of course most people didn't bother to write it all. Now, within an hour of anything I publish on slate. Uh, there are hundreds of comments and now that we've sort of gotten better at figuring out how to do comments, it's quite a good conversation that I participate in and I depend on that. I don't, I don't write to speak from on high to an invisible audience.

Speaker 1:          02:32          I write to relate to an audience of people, many of whom I start to know and recognize because they're so responsive to what I do. There's reviews on the Nasher incredibly successful. Lots of people follow them. Most of them are written by theater producers. Why wouldn't they be? You think someone's going to say, I can't do that because I put money into the production. The question about news generation on a thin news day, do we make it up? No, we don't make it up. We, we eke it out. We can put up and we, we look at on that, we spin it out and we generally sort of stuff it forward a little bit, but we don't absolutely make it up.
