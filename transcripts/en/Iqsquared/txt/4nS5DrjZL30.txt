Speaker 2:          00:10          in 1993, Boutros Boutros Oh, could also be called Boutros. Boutros Boutros rally. He, he was secretary general of United Nations and eminent French defied the option who in 1993 he said, well, it says we have to have democracy in Somalia for which we will have to build the economy, rebuild the economy. We want to have to build. The political institutions will have to brill, build a democratic state, will have to build the court system left to do this, and you have to do that. And the other. Now that seems like a completely lunatic program, you're going to go to a place like Somalia. You're going to build these things, but reflect Boutros, Boutros, Boutros. Ghali came from Egypt and in Egypt they have parliament that courts, they have all of these things coexisting with an undiminished dictatorship. So for embroiders galleys idea, you just go and set up.

Speaker 2:          01:11          You'll get a building and you call it the parliament building. You create another, another building called the electoral commission, and then you have. You will summon different people and say, you're going to organize the Democratic Party and you're going to organize the central party and you're going to organize the patriotic party. You better be smart about that, and so that was the idea of creating democracy for the secretary general of United Nations in 1993 was something that was very straightforward because you had the Egyptian case, a great warning there in the case of Egypt, because you'll have all the forms, the externally created externally induced forms which actually provide extremely comfortable framework for a dictatorship.

You have no weapon and no tool to protest or to react to a flagrant injustice, a bloodbath or gen site in the name of what should you react to the genocide in Rwanda or to the beginning of genocide in Darfur. If you don't believe that democracy is for everyone, if you believe like, hey girl and Spangler, that humanity in divided into different spaces and so on and so that's why. If you oppose the motion, it is not because I believe that we shall build all of a sudden tomorrow morning a fake British parliamentary democracy in the disaster, the inhabited areas of dark pool, which I visited a few weeks ago. Of course not in these parts of Africa where the human cleansing has been nearly achieved. Of course windows have them ocracy coming from from the soil, but believing that democracy is for everyone just means that you have enhance some tools, some arguments, some worlds, some values which are low you to condemn what is happening. For example, in doctoral.
