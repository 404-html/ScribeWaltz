Speaker 1:          00:03          We must reject, I would say fundamentally the idea of those deportations to torture it doesn't work. It undermines the very values that we are fighting to defend. It undermines democracy, the rule of law and basic human rights and human rights, all the only universal language of mankind that transcends national identity that transcends religious and cultural differences. If we start losing them, we have no language and they're basic principles, the to talk to other people in other cultures and other nations in other racial groups for if we started abandoning them and then they'll say, you've got no moral authority at all to preach to us, to talk to us or to tell us. So I asked you to vote for justice. I asked you to vote for reason. I asked you to vote against rough justice, vote with our House of Lords in rejecting Belmarsh vote with our mps in rejecting the 90 days and say no to rough justice.

Speaker 2:          01:06          Thank you.
