Speaker 1:          00:00          I had a friend in Albany and she called me. She said, Robert Moses was up here yesterday and I think you should come back, and I remember driving up to Albany and walking into the press gallery of the assembly just as they approved the bridge by a vote of something like 183 to four, and I remember thinking in that moment everything I've been writing has sorta been baloney because whether you say it or not in an article, everything I was doing was based on the feeling that ended democracy. Political power comes from the ballot box from being elected from the people. Yet here was a man who was never elected to anything and enough power to turn in an entire state government around in a single day and I had no idea and actually neither did anybody else where he got this power from. And it was then that. I thought that if I really wanted to write about politics, truthfully I have to find out because no one knew where he got his power and how we had been using it for so long.
