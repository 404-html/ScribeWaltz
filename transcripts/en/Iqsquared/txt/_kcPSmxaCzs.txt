Speaker 1:          00:02          How many of you believe that nature has a balance, that nature is this fine, liberal, even beautiful, complicated tapestry of interrelated things that all lien one against the other and make it all perfect and wonderful. Because if you do, and it's what George Bailey's is, you're entirely wrong. Nature works on Cataclysm and accident. We all, we are all competitive. We were born competitive. We grew up competitive. We were evolved from competition. There is no right way for the world to be. There was no moment where George's world was just keep it there, don't move. I think that there was no marvelous time when the up plans with just that nice little bit of woodiness and not too many festivals and it didn't exist. We all get on because something else fails. The natural role in existence is to lead to extermination. That's what happens to most things. We've been immensely successful as a species. That's not our fault. That's our brilliance.

Speaker 2:          01:26          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:26          What I mind about George's view of the world is that there is nature and then there's us, there's everything else. There's all the glory, and then there's me greedy, fat farting. Slovenly slothful, uncaring twat eating things with eyes. I am as much part of nature as every other species here in this world. All of us are, and what I mind about this view of the way the world works is it stopped me being part of my birthright, which is part of natural selection. It makes me a fucking zoo keeper, and I don't want to be a park ranger in your park.
