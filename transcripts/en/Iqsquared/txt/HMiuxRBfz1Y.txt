Speaker 2:          00:36          Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much all for coming to our first debate in, in the series a, you will know that the title of the debate is the world needs religion even if it doesn't need God. I don't know what the answer to that is, but I think that one thing I do know is that intelligence squared needs religion for what has become an almost annual ritual of debating about it. Um, many of you will have seen, uh, some of the those debates and the great moments, they've been the Catholic church as a force for good atheisms a new fundamentalism and stop bashing Christians. Um, they've all been fantastic events and this evenings is a, um, uh, is going to add to that great lineage of debates about religion. Without any further ado, let me introduce, let me do one thing first. Let me tell you about the voting. You were all polled on the way in, on your opinion about this. At the, I will announce the initial poll at the end of the opening speeches, and I will, and you will then be pulled again during the closing speeches that were, the question will be, how many minds have been changed by our distinguished panel.
