Speaker 2:          00:18          say something about your relationship with your father when there was not much of a relationship because he was always absent. My parents divorced very early on and he was, he lived in a, in a world of after the collapse of, of Germany and the destruction of Germany. He fled into, into, uh, uh, his kingdom of fantasies and he fantasized about writing a universal study and he had to study a. He actually studied biology and history and psychology and he spoke eight or nine languages including Japanese and he refused to work and he refused to earn money because he was working on the study in his wife's, always had his women always had to earn money and race of children and cook the food and he was resting and taking notes.

How should I say? I have, I certainly have humane and it should not be overlooked.
