Speaker 1:          00:00          Cori, what about you, do you think it could have evolved in an entirely different way and retain some of that openness and sense of boundless freedom there? Well, I mean, I'm not a historical determinists, so yes, of course, lots of different things could have happened. Yeah, I mean I believe in the adjacent possible so people have ideas for things like airplanes at periodic intervals through the whole of human history. But eventually some of those ideas get realized because we have material science and physics to kind of catch up with it, which is what, when people say you get railroads when it's railroading time, they don't mean that there's a mystical railroading energy in the air. They just mean that we have now attained the point where when that idea occurs with it's on scheduled regularity, that's some of the people to whom it occurs will be able to figure out how to make it a reality.

Speaker 1:          00:43          So I don't think we run on rails. I think we have lots of moments in our history where things have gone well and somewhere they've gone poorly. When the robot web consortium, uh, decided that members who participated in standard setting would have to have your web patents, so there would be no tollgates for producing web technology. That was a key juncture. I could have gone a different way. It could have been much worse. But on the other hand, when the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was passed in 98, and when the European Union copyright directive was passed in 2001, both of them produce extraordinarily bad policy that if we hadn't had it, I think things would be much better. They both provide for, among other things, an unaccountable system of arbitrary censorship and a rule prohibiting a disclosing security vulnerabilities in technologies that we rely on which could have produced, uh, which, which does present a clear and present danger to us. Which is only gonna get worse unless we can do something about it.
