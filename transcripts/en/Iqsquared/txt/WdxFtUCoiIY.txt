Speaker 1:          00:00          This photograph here, you're probably thinking, why have I shown you a picture of a sort of a suburban street happens to be in Blackpool, which is quite interesting for this discussion because what it shows us a big crack that goes just underneath my name there and that crack was very famous in Blackpool for a short time because it purportedly appeared after an earthquake which was related to fracking rather nearby it's fracking for shale gas, hydraulic fracturing, and people said that the fractured appeared the crack it appeared in the bridge and people also said that the motorbikes had fallen over and that and that traffic lights stopped working and things like that. And a lot of people said yes, the crack appeared and it was caused by the fracking. Now the BGS detected this earthquake and our view was there's no way that the energy of the earthquake could have caused that crack.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Then. And in fact, if you read the article which was attached to this photograph, if you've got knocked down to the bottom, it said an old black poor man said. In fact that crack has been there since 1972. So, uh, but this, this characterizes the argument of shale gas that there's an awful lot of stuff going on which you can't tell is true or false and this, it's rather got worse. And unfortunately this is a game, Blackpool, Blackpool, and uh, there are people saying on websites that Blackpool at the coast of backfill is at risk of sinking below sea level and our seat, a sea defenses will have to be rebuilt. Essentially. There is no foundation whatsoever to this. It simply won't happen.
