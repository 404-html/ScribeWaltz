Speaker 1:          00:12          Let me remind you of the votes as you came in. 51 don't knows. That's gone to home to 10 and then we had 119 four and 84 against. We're now at 127 against. In other words, you've done a pretty good job, but not quite good enough with 139 agreeing with the motion. Thank you very much.
