Speaker 2:          00:39          Hello, I'm Dana. Welcome to this intelligence squared debate. It's coming to you from Cadogan Hall in central London. It's exactly 10 years ago that nine 11 happened. Nearly 3000 people were killed in those attacks in America and they changed the course of world history forever. George W. Bush launched his war on terror in a matter of weeks. Afghanistan was invaded in order to remove the Taliban from power who had harbored al-Qaida. And then in March, 2003 there was the controversial war in Iraq. The Americans set up Guantanamo Bay as a detention center to interrogate terrorist suspects. The motion in our debate a decade on was the war on terror, the right response to nine 11 and in our panel we have some of the key figures from that time purveyors, Musharraf was president of parking

Speaker 2:          02:27          Good luck to you all. Now before we hear you, um, make your opening statement, it's nice. You just very quickly run through what to expect in our debate. As you, our audience were coming in, you were almost to vote to see where you stand on the motion right now. Then each of our panel members will make their opening statements to you. Then you will have a chance to put questions or even make comments indeed to our panel members. After that, they will make some brief closing arguments and we will ask you to vote again to see if you've perhaps changed your mind and where the boat that stands. So I hope that's all clear.
