Speaker 1:          00:00          In credential guesses? A fairly good example, right? Will it really be replicable elsewhere in the world? It's the success of North America. Is that going to happen in China and South America and maybe in more modest form here that's not very certain. Look at the Bolus Ebay, I'll say public debate about fracking. People don't really sure, right? Why should we do that? But if uncle venture guests is successful at re doubles the previous thought resource base of gas and then it really makes it a real game changer. You can really go for different types of energy systems in a sense that you can early gains replace coal by guests, but Su built an big infrastructure system, uh, on guests. Also, you start opening up options for the future. I will call and say you have room to maneuver in 2020s, 2030s because you haven't guests infrastructure, which is also easily as they'll ask extra cost. They make suitable for hydrogen gas or liquid hydrogen. So actually my count, you're lucky because you have an infrastructure you can piggy back on. If you do another roots, then you don't have the infrastructure. And then it becomes very expensive to introduce hydrogen.
