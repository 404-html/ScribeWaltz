Speaker 1:          00:18          Well, good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the meet in the middle of the sandwich. My first thing is to say, please turn off your mobile phones because it was always someone who forgets we get a bit of old or Beethoven or they're not hearing tune. It's very distracting. Secondly, make sure you don't lose these in the course of the debate because you're going to need them to vote at the end, nor should you tear them in half because if you are going to vote, don't know. You need to put those in together or looking forward to a very lively interchange from the between the panel on the floor, so sharpen your wits and make notes of anything you find that is either particularly excellent you want to amplify or particularly annoying that you want to rebut. Your time will come. You can read, not going to say, well, that was a consequence of the empire or not.

Speaker 1:          01:09          You're going to read so I'm not going to give very long biographies. I should just introduce the speakers. I'm very briefly, but I would urge you please to buy all the books on sale outside. They all make ideal Christmas presents and um, it's the best. The nicest thing for the speaker after the emotion, even if they haven't, one, is to be besieged by people saying, please can you sign this copy of the book or even better copies of the book. The emotion, um, is Britain's former colonies should stop blaming the empire for their ills. And one can debate that a little bit in terms of the terms. What exactly do we mean by our colony is a Scotland commonly is arland economy is corn will accompany. France might used to be British at one point, or at least bits of it.
