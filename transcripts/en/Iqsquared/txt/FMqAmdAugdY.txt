Speaker 1:          00:00          I'd like to share briefly with you before concluding some of the work that we've been doing on urban China. By the end of 2010, the Chinese urban population was existed estimated, excuse me, at 660 million people by 20, 30, and additional 300 million people are expected to have joined the urban ranks of China by my by migration or birth. Now, according to Mckinsey, as many as a quarter of total global growth in liquid fuel demand in the next 20 years is expected just to come from China's cities. Shell's been working in China for some time and we've recently considered urbanization there as part of a project which is looked more broadly at the future energy needs of the country. And one of the key insights, and I think one of the most exciting things that that study was able to find is that by focusing on density alone are in small to medium sized cities and we're talking about creating a density roughly equal to the average density of London or or the density of Paris. It could be possible to contain all urban growth in China. To 20, 30 within the existing urban footprint, and we looked at something like 480 cities have of 100,000 to half a million people, uh, in looking at this and that move alone would save an estimated 75,000 square kilometers of arable land in a country which is crying out for arable land. And that's an area almost the size of Scotland. And in doing so, it would create the conditions by which energy could be reduced and emissions impacted.
