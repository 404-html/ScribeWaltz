Speaker 1:          00:07          Regarding intervention or the West should do. I think, yes, I'm in an ideal situation. I would agree that a humanitarian corey doors, safe zones, uh, you name it, no fly zones, brilliant, but it's never going to happen and it's never going to happen because I think the United States, uh, has reached the conclusion that a choice to topple Michelle said, then let's be quite clear. I mean, if the United States, NATO gets involved, I think the regime will crumble very quickly, but a quick crumbling of the regime or the collapse of the regime will inevitably lead to a prolonged the Lebanon style civil war because potentially the partition of Syria and this is a very real prospect by the way. So should we interpret you saying that as meaning that your urging us to be careful what we wish for. In a way, you're saying that if the, if the regime collapses, it's not wholly a good thing.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Well to be a realistic, even in regime collapse a look that the region probably has probably about 2 million hardcore supporters. And again, I'm being very realistic and very honest with you. There are, Jim does have those people and those, I mean Gaddafi didn't have 2 million people, a hardcore sport is not robotic, but by Sharon does and that's the primary reason why he's still in power and those 2 million people are simply going to go away. They're going to stay in Syria, they probably going to fight, they're going to reinforce their own areas and they're probably going to fight against the central government. Whoever takes control in Damascus. So you know, we have to be realistic about this. What can be done immediately. I think the West can perhaps through the Qataris and the Saudis for instance, they can support local military councils and they are being set up to organize the free Syrian army on a local level and they can spot those people.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Problem is the Jordanians and the Turks won't allow a arms in, don't even allow humanitarian aid through their border. Um, so this is a big, big logistical problem. You can, you can pay FSA, fight salaries, but I mean, I don't say, I don't see how that, that, that's going to help you need weapons. So particular type of. Okay, we're good. Come to the JC, your, your, the proposal you would support is the same as Roger Korean's arming the opposition? Yeah, I mean look, as long as she believes that he can win militarily and at the moment he does believe he can win militarily, then there will be no political solution and ultimately there has to be a political solution. There can be no, no other, no other solution. So it's about forcing by. Charlotte said to sit on the negotiating table and he'll only do that if he faces and armed opposition that could seriously fight him at least to a stalemate. Absolutely.
