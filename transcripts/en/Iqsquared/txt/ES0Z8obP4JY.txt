Speaker 1:          00:07          I am pro intervention with respect to Syria, but pro intervention with the following caveat, I think intervention at this point is inevitable. I don't see how this regime, although it's fall, might be construed as inevitable. That's certainly with the White House has been saying it could still very well carry on for at least a year if not more. Can you define, define for us what I believe in this sort of safe zone scenario for Syria, one that is being now mooted by the Turkish government, uh, which has been threatened to be imposed by the Turkish government since last June. And I also would agree that there needs to be some kind of aerial component. I mean the rebels cannot face a tanks and helicopter gunships which are now firing on them alone. There needs to be some kind of a full scale, a military intervention. By that I don't mean out in occupation.

Speaker 1:          00:53          All Iraq, I'm talking about things that are already being put into motion are already being considered by the United States and by Turkey. So an enforced no fly zone for snow flies. I'm to just harder you through this, but could that be light on the sort of Libya model where that means not just enforcing it but actually taking out soon air to air defense capability? Yes, and also, I mean, keep in mind a no fly zone doesn't just necessarily bomb barracks. In fact, I don't think that in this case that's, that's called for it. Um, it would also target the placement of hell heavy artillery tanks. It would also control the [inaudible] highway, which is the main ground transport throughout all of Syria. You cannot really can conduct this kind of ground campaign against the rebels if you can't operate on the main thoroughfares of the country. So yes, it would be similar to, to Olivia style intervention, but not exactly. Of course, the two countries are vastly different in many ways now deem your shaking your head.

Speaker 2:          01:44          This has disastrous go. If this option goes, you don't know what, what, what the capabilities of, of, of the Syrian army, we're talking about one of the mightiest armies in the Middle East with, with tanks and heavy alternately and, and war ships and jet fighters. And, and what are you going to destroy and how much are you going to destroy without going into a full war with the country? I mean, this is absolute disastrous option. The intervention will, will open the country into a, an abyss.
