Speaker 1:          00:01          There's a new hierarchy and tone and it's the hierarchy of Silicon Valley to the people who run these companies. There is an astonishing sense of power, but in the last 12 months there's been a realization that as they say in the spiderman movies with great power comes great responsibility and a great deal of trouble too if you don't know how to manage that responsibility. Of course, Neil, most of those, if probably all, almost all of those silicon valley Internet billionaires would have preferred Hillary Clinton of compressed the United States and she didn't. So to their utter horror, and it really was, it was really kind of fascinating to watch up close. They found that the network platforms they'd created could be used to achieve the opposite of what they had intended. It was not the Clinton administration, the Clinton campaign that knew how to use facebook to target advertising in order to secure the swing states.

Speaker 1:          01:03          It was the trump campaign. It was Steve Bannon and jared Kushner, not to mention Russian intelligence, but we are in the midst of a great expose a, which is not over, that is going to reveal the extent to which trump campaign in a large way and the Russian intelligence network in a small way used facebook and to a lesser extent, other platforms to achieve victory in the 2016 presidential election. And I argue in the book, and I stand by it, that Donald Trump would not be president today if there had not been facebook and twitter and the other platforms that were used, uh, in a conventional, traditional American election campaign, he would have been defeated because he would've been out spent Hillary Clinton outspent Donald Trump two to one more than two to one, uh, on standard cable and terrestrial television advertising, he would have lost. So this was a hugely significant moment in American political history. I still don't think people realize the extent to which it depended on the use of facebook in particular.
