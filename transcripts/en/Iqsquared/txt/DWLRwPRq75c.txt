Speaker 1:          00:01          The trump supporters, I'm a resistance to judging trump on his merits, of which there are none, you know, uh, comes down in part to this with this loop, back to that rebellion against the elites. Now, one of the things that, there has been tremendous scorn for and fun made of trump and in deed deed trump supporters in when you are angry at the establishment and you see the establishment and not, not just disagreeing with your candidate, but mocking or candidate. There is an element of this is they're mocking me. They're mocking me. All these people at the New York Times going on and on about how does this is impossible. This horrible person cannot possibly be president too. They're saying that I am so, you know, because I support him, you know, they're looking down on me. It's all these fancy college educated people and I'm the one doing the hard work, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:06          And they're looking down at me. And so there was almost every time you went out to make fun of trump, you increased to support because people were feeling scorned. You know, when, when, when people feel that they are outsiders, you cannot convince them by mocking them and you can't convince them by mocking their position, the he, we had to either wait for what seems I hope to have happen for the guy's head explode, you know, or we had to take, you know, some sort of other approach to, to, to this and say, well, you know, let's, let's look at it from this angle. Or you know, maybe this is a good reason to vote for the Libertarian party or maybe it anyway. The scorn does not. When, when people feel scorned to heap, scorn upon them isn't going to work.
