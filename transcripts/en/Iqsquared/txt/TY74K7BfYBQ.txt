Speaker 1:          00:00          It's almost become an orthodoxy for people to say, oh, magna Carta is a bit of an irrelevant piece of Gulf. Uh, I don't think it is irrelevant Gulf. I think it's very important not for what it meant in 1215 but for the symbol that it became and for the significance that it acquired as part of the common law. And to give you what seems to me to be a good example, a blackstone's commentaries on the law of England, the classic 18th century text of English common law principles published in 1765 blackstone when considering the notion of absolute fundamental rights under the English constitution takes us his starting point. Magna Carta, which he calls that great charter obtained at the point of a sword and he identifies from magna Carta three fundamental rights, which actually I think you can discern in clause 39 the right to life or personal autonomy, the right to liberty and the right to private property.

Speaker 1:          01:09          Because what clause 39 says is that you cannot apply force to somebody. You cannot exile them. You cannot take their property and you cannot imprison them without judgment of their peers or without the application of the law. And from those, from that principal, he identifies those three fundamental rights. And then he says this, he says, in order for those three fundamental rights to have any purchase, they must be supported by ancillary rights. And he identifies three of those as well. The first is the rights and privileges of parliament. The second is the limitations on the royal prerogative and on the executive. And the third is the right of access to justice and the significance of close, close, 40 to no man will we sell, delay or deny justice is that that encapsulates the notion of access to justice so that what you have, I think a magna Carta is the kernel of two basic constitutional principles.

Speaker 1:          02:11          Firstly, the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights. And secondly, the need for access to court to support the rule of law. And that concept runs through the common law. You can see it in modern case law, important cases like with them about access to justice, medical justice, and whether you're actually citing magna Carta and I ice eyesight, blackstone's commentaries. And I've done it in many cases and it gets much more purchase with a common law judge in many occasions. And the Human Rights Act does because blackstone's speaks to the breast of the judges in the common law. And the origin of those principles ultimately is a magna Carta. And if you look at a case like the are raw we decision that said that the common law would not tolerate secret courts. That is a passionate declaration by the Supreme Court of the importance of basic principles of open justice, uh, which ultimately have their origin, not in Magna Carta itself, but in Magna Carta as a symbol as it's developed over the following 800 years.
