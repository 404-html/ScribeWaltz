Speaker 1:          00:00          There's been this enormous increase in inequality and that it has multiple, multiple dimensions. Uh, there, there is, uh, more money at the top, uh, at the beginning, uh, I, Eh, in Reagan when Reagan in 1980, he started pushing for the kinds of changes in economic policy. Uh, it was, uh, there was an awareness that those policies would lead to more, more inequality. Um, the idea was that, uh, you lower tax rates at the top and you, uh, free up the economy and deregulate and the hope was the idea was that it would, yes, there'll be more inequality, but the size of the pie would increase. So much so that everybody, even those in the middle of the bottom would be better off. They would get a bigger piece even if they got a smaller share. Well, we've had a third of a century now of this experiment and we can see the outcome.

Speaker 1:          01:18          They were right, that it would include increased inequality and the sheer going to the top 1% has gone to numbers between 20 and 25%. Uh, that's it. Two fold increase in the share, going to the top, one 10th of 1% has increased three to four fold. But unfortunately, this idea of trickle down economics that everybody would benefit is absolutely wrong. And what does actually happen is median income make I'm in the middle, has stagnated income at the bottom. You saved him worse. So in the middle income today, the median income of a in the United States adjusted for inflation is lower than it was a quarter of a century ago. And at the bottom, the minimum wage has not increased for 45 years. So I think then an economic system that doesn't increase standards of living for a majority of its citizens over a period of a quarter century end of the bottom has people worse off than they were almost 50 years ago is a failed economic system.

Speaker 2:          02:34          Ah.
