Speaker 1:          00:01          So I'm going to leave you with a few very simple prescriptions in terms of what what we can do so we can stop talking about mothers and start talking about parents every time you want to say mother, stop. Say parents and children, parents and family stopped talking about daughters and start talking about caregivers are in Britain, carers, carers for parents, whether their sons or daughters stopped talking about fathers and start talking about earners or providers. Both men and women start assuming that every everybody, men and women want some combination of the ability to invest in themselves and to invest in others, everyone and that all workers, all employees will have caregiving responsibilities at some point in their lives and a competitive effective workplace. Efficient, productive will make room for that kind of care and start assuming that investing in others is every bit as important and rewarding and valuable as investing in ourselves.

Speaker 1:          01:27          And finally, I don't think I would call it equalism. I think a Galitary aneurysm is better, but maybe isms are not the way to go. What we are looking for is a world in which we don't assume everyone is the same, absolutely not, but a world in which our assumptions about who someone is and what they want and what they can achieve and what their potential is is not tied to their sex or their gender or their sexual orientation any more than it is tied to the shape of their features or the color of their skin.

Speaker 2:          02:14          Thank you.
