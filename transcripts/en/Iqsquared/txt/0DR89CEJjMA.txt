Speaker 1:          00:00          The right rises, the hard revolting rate rises. It feeds off immigration, but it rises when those decent politicians on the right give it room to rise and doesn't fight it. I watched Marine Le Pen rise and it was when the conventional parties in France bent towards her and the advent of Ukip and its rise is because the conservative party did the same thing and mark and Angela Merkel is an example of what you can do to lead a nation to another destination. Churchill called us the Mongrel nation and so we are, we are the product of succeeding waves of immigration into this country and it makes us what we are and this is the Mongrel city and it is the most successful global city in the world because of that place, a barrier up to it as the gentleman over here once and you remove that.

Speaker 1:          00:44          I disagreed with the idea that it's only Muslims who are responsible for overturning our values. You've always been able to find gentleman over there was right young men who will see, who will think it is part of a noble calls to kill innocent people. That was the anarchist at the turn of the 19th century. It was the bottom line, half guard gang. It was the road facsia. I don't have to go to Baghdad to hear a preacher preaching death row. Put it. I can go to Belfast. These have always been there, and it is wrong of Malcolm Rifkind to ascribe this simply to Muslims. These are people who wish to overturn the values, who happened to be Muslims, but we've had plenty of Christians seeking to do it. Look, we haven't got all the answers. This is one of the really great conundrums, challenges, moral and practical to confront us. I know some of the things we ought to be doing or not doing, but I haven't got a solution to all of these. We're going to have to think, but I'll tell you one thing. If you do not do this on the basis of your humanity, then you will be left with only one way to do it. Moats and walls and barbed wire, and then you lose your humanity and you'll create another reason for even more walls.
