Speaker 1:          00:00          Ladies and gentlemen, although important progress has been made in recent years to reduce poverty today, one point 2 billion people are still in extreme poverty. Combating poverty means revisiting our global development goals to ensure that they respond to the day's needs and realities. Poverty is a multidimensional challenge that impacts the wellbeing of citizens in societies worldwide. It goes beyond material deprivation, affecting people's health, their self esteem, and their ability to participate in society and connect with other people. It also hampers development by reducing society's capacity to innovate and promote progress. This is why our quest for ending poverty calls for measures that go beyond the income to address inequality, sustainability, inclusiveness, and wellbeing. Tonight's discussion will shed light on what we can and must do to address one of the most formidable challenges of the 21st century ending poverty completely forever. So let's dedicate all our efforts, all our energy and all our expertise to this most worthy undertaking.
