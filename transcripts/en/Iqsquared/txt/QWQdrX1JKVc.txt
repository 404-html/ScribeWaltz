Speaker 1:          00:11          What makes it art capital? Well, I think I go back to my spin ball question at the beginning, which is artists making interesting work in an artistic environment that's conducive for them to make it.

Speaker 2:          00:24          When people talk about London as an art capital in very positive terms. The word they always use is the word they used to only use about New York and that's energy and there's a sense that when a, when a certain dynamic occurs, an energy that kind of pervasive sense of energy is produced and this seems to me to be an absolute critical thing and the artists were very central to making that happen. But, but that, that seems to me to be the, the edge of difference between a place that's really got something happening and something someplace that's a nice showcase or something, but it doesn't have that inner vitality.

Speaker 3:          01:04          I'd like to say that if there is the energy that it will translate into something positive. Um, and I've certainly seen examples as I said in South Asia where there hasn't been government funding. Whereas cities have become very, very interesting spaces for artists. But on the other hand, having seen the examples of Hong Kong and Singapore where the government does fund various schemes and does fund art schools and art education and institutions and everything else that goes along with it, it is much easier for artists to live in that environment and for an art capital to grow out of that environment.

Speaker 4:          01:51          Yeah, I think it's a city. You just have to be able to attract people who are artists, which is echoing something you said earlier and maybe you have to be a bit of a mess of a city sometimes to do that. You have to be interested in in in ways that might be messy ways. I mean, I lived in Los Angeles for a long time and there was a very odd ball art group of artists there. They were really mavericks who didn't want to go to New York. I mean, by choosing to be in Los Angeles, they were really thumbing their nose at the artist stablish mint. But it included people like every Shay, Mike, Kelly, Paul Mccarthy, Chris Burden, Raymond Pettibone, artists who are very well known, but they were all extremely eccentric, uh, and they really didn't want to be part of this art establishment in La, especially when I was living. There was much more of a messy place just like the way in London in some ways. It's kind of a messy labyrinthine city, uh, spread out over miles scenerio. It's, um, so I think when I think of a place like Singapore, I think it's got to get a little dirtier.
