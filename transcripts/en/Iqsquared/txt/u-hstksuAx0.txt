Speaker 1:          00:08          That we've witnessed innocent people being slaughtered on an industrial scale in Syria. My feeling is now one that you cannot allow an armed mafia to take revenge on an entire country without allowing some protection for civilians. Now what that kind of protection might take is something that we have all Assyrians debated very painfully. It's not an easy thing to say with the example of Iraq fresh in our mind that yes, we do want military intervention, but I think what we do absolutely need our safe corridors that would enable families of displaced persons to reach safety without being killed. We would need safe corridors for defectors. The reason we don't have the kind of detection on a large scale from the army is because the price of defection is intolerably high and it's not just the people that affect your shot.

Speaker 2:          01:18          When people hear the phrase safe corridor, think who could be against safe corridor was, it sounds wonderful, but to do that, to enforce it will mean heavy duty and that what will others that are not in the room now worn is that that will mean a huge unleashing of the kind of blood boil.

Speaker 1:          01:35          Well, we already have a blood bath of. Yeah. Can I,

Speaker 2:          01:40          I want to get in on this because I want to know just how it felt when you were there that moment when you were an attack, but even before then when you saw people being. Did you yourself think the only way to solve this is the outside world has to act?

Speaker 3:          01:54          Absolutely. It's one thing, I guess seeing it from a distance to be involved in it, to watch it, to watch people dying for a piece of bread, the risks people were taking just to feed themselves. Um, there is no option. You know, they are a well trained army, but it was actually pointed out to me by many military defectors, high level military defectors that the Syrian army is a big, powerful arm. It's also not an army that is actually trained to fight was whether the army as an army base, there are several suppression of civilians, so when it comes to taking out, as would be the case if we're to create safe and safe havens, they're. They're not such big guys when it comes to that. They're very good that I'm surrounded civilians and killing them.

Speaker 2:          02:45          In other words, what the kind of remedies that Michael Weiss has application application using the price wouldn't be so unbearable.

Speaker 3:          02:51          Absolutely. Absolutely. I think that, you know, we, we, we, we overestimate the scale and the size of the city and capability to fight back when it is an army and civilian population.
