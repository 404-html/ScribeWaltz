Speaker 1:          00:00          The millions of goods that are being educated. The millions of children that are getting vaccines, the thousands of civil society organizations that have been strengthened in the fight for human rights and in the fight against corruption should made us proud about eight because this is what aid is being used for. These are the red hots that aid is producing. At the same time, the development financing landscape is changing dramatically. Countries are racing more domestic resources through taxation. Private sector is investing more and new donors are playing an increasing role. So in this context, does it have a future? My answer is yes.

Speaker 2:          00:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47          The other question is, is that future going to be the same as in the past? My answer is equally clear. No. In order to remain relevant in this changing landscape, eight has got to become smarter. What does that mean in practice? To me it means at least the things it means. First of all, that is going to be used where it's most needed in countries, areas to people that have less access to other sources of funding. Secondly, it's got to be used to strengthen countries own capacities. To solve their problems. So the lessons of the Paris Declaration of the and agenda for action and of the somme used country systems, they are still relevant. But thirdly, it's got to be used smarter to catalyze other sources of funding, to help mobilize private funding, to help increase taxation, to help use remittances better, uh, for development. And I think if we use eight smarter than it will be possible to continue to convince taxpayers in countries that are struggling at present that aid is relevant also in the future.
