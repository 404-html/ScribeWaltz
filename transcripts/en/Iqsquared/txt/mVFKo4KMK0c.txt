Speaker 1:          00:00          What Kara Keller did, and two, one, two, eight to 1280 was only the final apt long process which started when the founder of Rome Romulus welcomed refugees and asylum seekers to his new city by the Tiber to be proper Roman citizens, which carried on as citizenship was spread among those whom Rome conquered, and when people from far of field became Roman emperors, Trajan and Hadrian from Spain, Septimius severus from North Africa, that could never have happened at Athens, and at the same time, slaves in their millions were fruit at Rome, at in the process completely unlike in the Greek world. They became full Roman citizens. Many fewer slaves wherever fried in Athens or any of the Greek states in which we know, and if they were freed, they certainly didn't become citizens. This was an incorporated community. Now, some observant people in Greece early on spotted these weird habits of the Romans and they were amazed. A few of the smartest began to think that maybe Roman openness was the secret of her success, and that's what I think. I think too. I think robes real Rome's rough. It's in your face. It's open, it's welcoming, and it's us. Thank you.
