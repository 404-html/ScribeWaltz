Speaker 1:          00:00          The Millennium Development Goals, Gavin, I support for poverty reduction today, the target of housing, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been met. Progress has been uneven as the United Nations and its partners shape a new global framework to replace the mdgs in 2015. They faced the challenge of ending poverty for good, which means tackling some important questions. What is poverty? How is it measured? Poverty is not only the income and poor people do not live only in poor countries today, a new bottom billion live in middle income countries, including India and China. It's also not just a question of getting to zero, but staying there. Then there's the issue of where to fix the new development goal posts to recapture the Millennium Declarations vision. The new international development agenda must embody principles of solidarity, equality, dignity and respect for nature. Finally, once these goals have been agreed, how will they be achieved? We'll need new policies and leadership by national governments and the global community, but what else? On the fifth of December, 2013, we debated these questions and others with the panel of world experts kick here to watch the arguments.
