Speaker 1:          00:17          There is a fundamental anthropologic will need for physical shopping. So I don't think the high street is going anywhere anytime soon, but I think shopping has evolved over the years and it will continue to evolve. Technology does represent, I think a chance for a fundamental change in the nature of the high street. We all seen dramatic change in high streets in town centers. That means they are never ever going to be the way they, that will always be the bookies and the charity shops, um, under greg's on high street. But I think, yeah, most of us that have that traditional retailers will migrate online. We're definitely not saying that. I think the high street, I don't think anyway, I think there's a place to have online shopping and the high street for anything, electronics or something like that. I'll buy it online, but for some things, maybe not just makeup and perfume and that kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Again, I think you want to go and see if it works with your skin or that kind of side of things. For me, it's the convenience of being at my house or my office and seeing literally everything at the world available for me to look up to. Many of these debates are around the idea of the high street as this really nostalgic view of the single thoroughfare that families would go to on a Saturday afternoon and do all of that shopping and that genuinely doesn't reflect the state of the world. I think it depends what you mean by the high streets. I mean a physical straight down the middle of a town potentially is under massive threat, but physical retail, I don't think we're going to see the test of it at all and also in that role still be in the middle of town.

Speaker 1:          02:02          I think you've raised some really interesting points and now jump up farther and do further research or no, I thought it was a really good opening to the discussion. It was very interesting. It's very controversial at times. I thought more boring for discussion and divide. It got me thinking with you about a few other things that I thought were maybe not employed right now or not. Kind of talk, talk to me about, and we're thinking about Ebay is a, as a store I think is, you know, is, um, you know, good as a, uh, as an online entity in itself, but also works well with offline. Some of the offerings that we have, like our relationship with our gos, which reinforces the High Street and gives people an extra option that, uh, kind of positively influences the, um, uh, the high street. So I, I think the high street is just in a period of rebirth rather than, uh, rather than any demise.
