Speaker 1:          00:04          Everybody can agree, especially in England, uh, that this was a crisis whereas the made in USA label and a, that we export it or toxic mortgages, uh, that, uh, in fact we send a thank you note all the time to your for buying so many of our toxic mortgages. We sold about 40 percent of them to Europe and, uh, it had it not been for that the downturn in the US would have been much worse. There were three parts of the response. The first was a stimulus and when Obama got elected, it was good that he finally got around to it. Bush didn't, didn't do anything about this, but it was too small and it was not well designed. We're not going to be out of this crisis very quickly. One of the things that will be emerging out of this crisis is realization of countries that have bigger reserves did better.

Speaker 1:          00:55          So there'll be an even greater demand for savings. Net will get reduce global aggregate demand. You have failed really to reform our global economic system. We have failed to reform a regulatory system, failed to provide the kind of economic system that would provide stability and security, and the result would add is that, uh, these economic weaknesses are going to persist. Do you think the American tax payer has been ripped off in essence by the band out of the American taxpayer, very clear, got treated very badly. The typical pattern in the chaos of a crisis. Uh, the bankers who caused the crisis than steal money massively because people aren't noticing that. And I said, Oh God, this is going to happen again in the United States. I hoped that we had better institutions, but what it turned out is that we had better mechanism for theft. It's such an elementary issue of incentives.

Speaker 1:          01:58          If you're too big to fail, then you have incentive to gamble because if you gamble and when you walk off with the prophets, even gamble and lose, the government picks up the tab a why not gamble? I think the UK did a much, much better in three ways. First, uh, you, you had some sense of accountability that you, some of the ceos had to go. Secondly, you put some conditions, we didn't put any condition, so we allow the money to pour in and pour out and we gave the story that we had to recapitalize the banks in order to help them land. But if money is pouring in and pouring, oh, that's not recapitalizing the banks. Thirdly, you tried a wasn't totally successful, but you understood you wanted the banks to start lending and you try to get some incentives, some institutional reforms to get the banks to land the criticism, the somewhere I work that I don't understand.

Speaker 1:          02:56          You know, I, I very good at identifying a market failure, but I'm a little bit less students in and talking about government failure. Uh, let me say that anybody in America lived through the Bush administration, understands government failure. We have to think much more carefully about how we spend money. So I'm very critical of the hundreds of billions of dollars that we spend in the United States. Um, weapons that don't work against enemies that don't exist. Um, we get neither security nor economic growth. So that seems to me a, a good target for cutting. And we disagree allocating that money to investments that will lead to higher growth and therefore lower a national debt in the long run.
