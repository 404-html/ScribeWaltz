Speaker 1:          00:00          Technology gives us the ability to create relationships in the supply chain relationships between producers and consumers much more flexibly and rapidly. We're seeing it already in food production, in transport resources such as journeys in cars and parking spaces. Um, and we're seeing it in the, in the manufacturer of custom goods. So the image on the bottom left is taken from shapeways where you can three d print pretty much anything that you like and the cost of this technology is coming down. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:29          okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30          At the same time, these marketplaces are transactional and we've got interesting opportunities to affect the rate of exchange used in those transactions. There's a, an alternative currency that's been in use in Switzerland for nearly a hundred years now. The where that starts to have contributed to economic stability. Though I suspect with someone from the lse chairing the debate, we may have a comment on that. Um, five towns of cities in the UK have their own local currencies now with similar intentions and they're increasingly using advanced technology to support those currencies such as the droplet smartphone payment system that's being created in, in Birmingham. These rates of exchange offers the possibility to compare the complete cost of goods and services, the financial costs and their social and environmental implications with dynamic low, highly localized value to the participants. What it's worth to me now to have this service rather than what it might be worth to me to have it in two weeks time when I really need it.

Speaker 2:          01:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:34          I think there's tremendous potential here to produce new information based marketplaces that could support more sustainable city systems, but if there such a good idea, why don't we have them do ubiquitously already.

Speaker 2:          01:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:48          And that comes down to something that's been mentioned by the other by the other speakers were cities are making progress on this agenda. It's where the coordinating the use of their public sector and private sector assets towards a cocreated division towards a common set of goals and objectives. But in order to win that level of commitment, you don't only need the buy in of the leaders and managers of those resources. You need the understanding of all of the stakeholders that they are accountable to their employees, the electorate, their shareholders. To appeal to that tremendously broad set of interests. We need to, I think, to appeal to some common instincts amongst us, all a sense of narrative and our ability to empathize rather than focus on the financial efficiencies created by smart infrastructures. And if we do that, we may not get very far because smart ideas cut across silos. So those who realize the benefits may not be those who are asked to make the investment in the first case. And instead we should be concentrating on the social and personal and community value that can be created when people can, and I can afford to buy better food where they could afford to heat their homes properly in winter when they have access to affordable transport to places of employment.
