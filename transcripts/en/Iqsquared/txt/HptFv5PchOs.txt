Speaker 1:          00:00          Can I just answer one point about doing more for the poor? Of course we should do more for the book, but why do we assume that it's either you deal with climate change or you do something for the poor? First of all, climate change, it's actually they had most of its effects in the developing countries and you can increase double or triple the amount of aid. It will still, because of climate change produced malnutrition, increasing hunger, it will certainly, uh, data produced more flooding. Uh, it'll produce, uh, the damage to crops. Um, it'll produce unclean water. It'll increase dysentery. I mean, it's not a one or the other. If you deal with climate change, we're doing a lot for the poor.
