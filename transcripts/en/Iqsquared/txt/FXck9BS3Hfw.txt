Speaker 1:          00:08          Square, welcome to the hall and to tonight's debate, which is b, where the Dragon Africa should not look at China. We've got a distinguished panel who actually introduce one by one as they go up and speak. This is a topic which has been something which has been exercising people here, I would say for the last five years or so, but it's ever more important because with the European and American economists flatlining and China's steaming ahead and African economies also seeming ahead. The world is changing and trade between Africa and China has now reached $100,000,000,000 a year. And I read the other day, uh, that the US assistant secretary of state, Johnny Carson said at some point last year, this was a big problem because China was operating in Africa with no morals and like everybody else operating in Africa whose morals I'm sure completely scrupulous and always have been.

Speaker 1:          01:25          But that does go to the heart of the debate. Doesn't set. Is China a model which has lifted hundreds of millions of its own people out of poverty and the Guide and the benign influence or is trying to reinforcing corruption, exploitation? I think that will be the heart of our debate tonight. Now, you would have been polled as you came in, whether you are a fool or against the motion and you should also have these voting cards. And so when the, uh, main species of finished and you've had the chance to ask a few questions yourself, people will be coming around with ballot boxes. So we would ask you to tear the sleeping half and vote for or against as you wish. If you really can't make your mind up, then you put a don't know which is the whole slip. But I hope that our panelists tonight, we'll be able to sway you one way or another. What's going to happen is everybody's going to get up and make their speech for about 10 minutes, but I'm going to ask each of the panelists to stay there after finishing the speech. And the opposing team will have some quick fire questions for them.
