Speaker 1:          00:00          Welcome to today's hot topic from intelligence squared.com too much free speech kills the massacre in Arizona shows that the USA must learn from Europe to curb hate speech. Do you agree? The Lone gunman who mowed down Gabrielle giffords was mentally disturbed, but where the outcomes of his ravings caused by the climate of political hostility. Sarah Pailin, for example, had placed gunsight icons on giffords. Congressional district. Does this mean she shares and the responsibility for what happened in Britain? Politician filled Willis was stripped of his seat and his party membership for the kind of polarizing language. That's an everyday occurrence in the USA. So who has got it right? Does liberal democracy need you to get a thick skin or does it need a strong state protecting us from extreme verbal assault? Here are some highlights from Wendy kaminer confronting femi ought to Taji as they thrash it out. We start with femi defending curbs on hate speech.

Speaker 2:          01:00          Less hate speech will be bread and so we would have less to fear. I hate speech can certainly be a contributing factor to bigotry and prejudice. And I'm, you know, I'm not a, I'm not here defending the merits of hate speech, but I, I, you know, as I said, I think it is always much more dangerous and I also think that it's morally wrong to criminalize speech that we don't like because we have some sense that in the long run it's, it's going to be, it's going to cause decide or harm. English should be given the right to speak yes to the point where it violates the rights of others. People may be given the right to express their concerns about principles, but not about individual characteristics of people. I personally am grateful and proud to live in a country and to be part of a nation that does not tolerate hate. Speech is anything I'd say that perhaps our restrictions and keeps me in the UK. I've go far enough if I can take this opportunity to respond quickly to some of the things that family said first. I, I really appreciate her forthrightness in questioning why we need to have freedom of speech, because that's not a statement that you will generally hear from people in the u s to defend hate speech regulation. Because here, um, it's not really so acceptable to say, I don't believe in free speech.
