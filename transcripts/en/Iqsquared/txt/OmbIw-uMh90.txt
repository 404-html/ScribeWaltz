Speaker 1:          00:00          Philosophers love the burning building scenario, so you've got two rooms, the building is burning and you can save either the thing in one room or the thing in the other, and that's the choice that you have. So imagine there's a child in one room and there's a Picasso in the other. The building is burning. Now, the effective altruist could argue that you can sell up a casio for many millions and with those millions, give that money to charity to a malaria net charity, which will then save a great many on a cost benefit analysis will say, have a great many more children. Okay, so the effective altruism faced with a burning Picasso and a burning child might save the Burning Picasso. Now this point, my sympathy for effective altruists just disappears and it disappears because I think there really is something that is not factored in here, which is the emotional sympathy, which is absolutely essential, which you have done everything you can to eliminate from our calculations, but I would call the person and when we disagree about this, I mean I think the technical term for the person that saves the Picasso, and I think this would be a sort of.

Speaker 1:          01:23          I think publicly I would get a lot of support for this. Maybe not here, but out there that the technical term for the person that saves the Picasso over the burning child is a heartless bastard.
