Speaker 1:          00:00          I agree that there is a lot wrong with Iran. It's hostility to Israel. It's appalling human rights record, but I doubt that that record is worse than that of Egypt or Saudi Arabia and we don't hear much from the West about that.

Speaker 2:          00:16          Thank you,

Speaker 1:          00:21          but there is another side to Iran. The revolutionaries are growing older and have a country to run. It is a country with significant elements of democracy. It has a large Christian population and also a significant Jewish population, the largest but small Jewish population in the Middle East, outside Israel that even represented in the Iranian parliament. Iran has made overtures in the past about improving relations with the West in 2003. It supported the American invasion of Afghanistan at the same time. It proposed normalizing relations with us and he offered to rein back at support for Hezbollah and Hamas and there's Jack Straw said all it got was to be called part of the access for evil. Iran unfortunately has many reasons to be distrustful of the West, the coup against Dr Moosa Deck simply because he wanted to run soil for Iran rather than for UK. Are maintaining the shine power along with the notorious, most most sad supported secret police in 1983 of us shot down in Iranian civil airliner killing 290 people and then there was the help the west gave Sudan was saying when he invaded in Iran, it's impossible to understand the security insecurity and the mentality of Iran without understanding the Iran Iraq war and the fact that they lost almost as many people in that war as we lost in the Second World War Iran.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Iran is not going to become the ally of the West overnight, if at all, but there are common interests that we have like fighting the Islamic state. Iranians are not apocalyptic millenarian madmen wanting to blow the world up. I believe that this deal gives us the best hope of improving relations with Iran. We have surely learned enough from our disasters actions in the past to prefer a negotiated settlement rather than to push us yet again into another catastrophic war in the Middle East.

Speaker 2:          02:35          Thank you.
