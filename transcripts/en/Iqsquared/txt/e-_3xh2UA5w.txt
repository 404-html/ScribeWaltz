Speaker 1:          00:00          I think government should do three things because I would argue that we're actually having a bit of a crisis right now and I just got stuck in hideous traffic coming across London. You know, London has an infrastructure problem but the web has a much, much bigger internet. Sorry. It has a much, much bigger infrastructure problem if you like and I think the government should focus on three things. Firstly, we have got to improve the state of our digital infrastructure urgently. You know, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to see that South Korea knock it out of the park all the time in terms of the economy and productivity, partly because they have that superfast infrastructure. That's one big piece of the puzzle and somewhere that government can be more aggressive. Secondly, we have an absolute crisis in gender on the Internet. Massive, huge, enormous.

Speaker 1:          00:44          The percentage of women in the tech and creative industries. I saw a report just this week have gone down. There are now nearly doubled the percentage of women in parliament that is probably marginally older than the tech sector double. It's a disaster. It's a disaster because power, money, product design, everything is worse and imbalanced and asymmetrical. So that's the second thing where I think they should intervene. And the third thing is that q and a broad, a broad, broader skills crisis, which I worked on for a while, and now we still have massive issue with the code and the jobs that we need to fill and a massive issue in broader digital skills, let alone the skills of our establishment and parliamentarians. And they had three, to me, very tangible areas that government could intervene. They don't even have to touch a big tech company to make a big shift in those areas.
