Speaker 1:          00:18          This, this interest in mania as this interest in these levees, where did all this come from? What's there? Can you go back maybe to an earlier time where this kind of an obsession or took hold the view? Well, it's, I wouldn't call it an obsession because it would be a wrong description of myself to be obsessive. I'm not, I'm just very calm and I'm trying to be a thinking men and people always think I this madman in this obsessed and he must be insane. I didn't take, I didn't know, but I know what's out there. I know, I know all the top locking us out there. And I have to say I'm the only one probably in southern England who is clinically sane. So one example. All right. Yeah, no, but uh, how to, how can I describe it? It in a, in a way possibly dated back to my childhood, which is spent in the, in a very remote mountain village in Bavaria.

Speaker 1:          01:24          You moved when you were three, four days old now, 10 or 14 days old and bombs hit Munich and my mother fled because of bomb pettit right next to our place. And then you went to this tiny town of Zach's suck cornea, which is not even a town. It's a tiny village and devastate a farmhouse outside, outside of Saffron. And that's where I grew up. And of course I had no idea of the world outside. As you know, I had never seen cinema until I was 11 I didn't even know that cinema existed. And in his children, his children, we had nothing.

But we had no toys and we had no games and we had to invent to games.

Speaker 1:          02:22          And you found you found toys? Yeah, well found toys. I wouldn't call it toys with toys. We found weapons. We found live and ammunition mission and pursue costs and things like this. And you've, you've spoken about that moment in time as a, as a happy moment in [inaudible] was very happy, very wonderful childhood with my brothers and other refugee children and farm children around. And we were getting a 14, actually 13 and one girl, uh, she, she was always with us and she was the rowdiest the most true, mostly independent and in courageous of, of us all. And, um, yeah. And of course, I dreamt of, um, uh, of shooting a crow because I had seen the route workers who had shot a crow. Nobody had anything to eat, and they pluck the feathers and they cooked it. And there was, there was on, on, uh, on the top of the soup there was, as we called it, ice of fat floating, which was sensational.
