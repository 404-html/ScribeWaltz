Speaker 2:          00:19          the best hope for modernization and ultimately liberalization in the Arab and Muslim worlds today lies in incumbent regimes who recognize that first of all, economic modernization is essential to their country's future.

Speaker 3:          00:36          How do groups like Al Qaeda operate? It should be clear by now that in parasitic fashion, these groups feed off of host nations that are weak. It is the relief from the life in purgatory that constitutes the average lot of the average Arab, that life is about unemployment. Real rates of up to 35 and 40 percent, and young men who when polled consistently complained that their existence offers no hope and no opportunity. It is about the fact that the United Nations Development Program estimate that nine percent of every business deal in the Middle East Coast for bribes, and when students who want to vote step into the streets of Cairo, they risk arrest and torture like Karim Solomon, who was sodomized, tortured because he demonstrated in favor of the rule of law. These victims of Middle Eastern depression are the ones who provide the oxygen that enables al Qaeda to operate and it gives resonance to their political messages.
