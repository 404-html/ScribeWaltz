Speaker 1:          00:00          What concerns me at the moment is something much more basic, much more fundamental, and much more closely related to the core of Magna Carta. What I, what I said a little bit earlier was that one of the fundamental points that comes out of Magna Carta is the idea that you have to have access to justice. That if you can't enforce your rights in a court, you have no rights. And in that sense, David Wright, that universal human rights are gfe if they can't be enforced. And that's why what interests me is not so much universal human rights but British civil liberties that can be enforced in our courts. And what concerns me at the moment is that this government is conducting a sustained an ideological attack on access to court and it is parsing almost without notice in the national media.

Speaker 1:          00:56          I want to give three examples of it. First of all, uh, the so called reforms to legal aid. Secondly, the proposals made two weeks ago massively to increase court fees which are passed almost without comment. And thirdly, the new legislation which will restrict access to judicial review. Firstly, in relation to legal aid, as many of you will know, uh, two years ago, the government, uh, removed legal aid for most forms of civil litigation, a whole areas where previously legal aid had been available. It was removed from including almost all family law cases except where there's recent evidence of domestic abuse. This has resulted in a far greater numbers of cases where people are litigants in person cases taking much longer and appalling situations arising in court. A situation a few weeks ago where a father was seeking access to a child where the mother said that he had sexually abused the child where because no legal aid was available, the judge was contemplating a situation where the father would have to cross examine his own child on the truth of the mother's allegation that he had abused that child, that that's an intolerable situation to have in any court and it is the direct result of government policy.

Speaker 1:          02:23          And the Lord Chancellor Christopher grayling sent leading council into that court to argue that it was the farthest choice to be unrepresented because he had the disposable income of 10,000 pounds a year. I'm not making this up. It happened. So that's the first thing. Legal Aid and the Public Accounts Committee yesterday, uh, produced a report in which they pointed out that the Ministry of Justice, it introduced these reforms without first taking the trouble to work out whether the money they would save would in fact be saved or whether they would simply be not con costs in other departments because of the physical and mental harm done to people who would no longer be able to get access to legal advice. And the comment of the Public Accounts Committee at a, a cross a party committee was that the Ministry of Justice now has no idea whether it's actually saved any money from these reforms.
