That's just keeps coming up again and again and it keeps crashing. So it's the Sisyphean moment of my life, whether I really shouldn't be continuing, even trying to do it, I don't know. My wife says, walk away from it. The problem is once you start trying to make quixote in any form, you become Kioti and you're trapped and the endless dream and reality collision that is your life.
