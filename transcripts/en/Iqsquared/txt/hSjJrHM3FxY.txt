Speaker 1:          00:21          We got to discuss the debate in the old fashioned one against that will be time for you to ask questions to the panel of the motion.

We have at least 10 outfits and the next two weeks to thank for them as well as the options. There was a grumpy fellow audrick to this week who claimed that it was absurd in the middle of the banking crisis. His paintings might sell for anywhere between two and 9 million pounds, but let's not forget where we are in the house of one of this country's most influential art collectors and taste makers, inventors, et Cetera. So part of the question is, does the money work of our commands make it better? So to help us answer this question, we have a very distinguished panel, but I'd like to find out from you, first of all, before we get going, quick show of hands, who thinks that is the best judge of good things? Put your hands up now on two, three, four? Yes. Okay.
