Speaker 1:          00:04          The world is more mobile than ever, but increased mobility has also brought congestion, high emissions and poor air quality with a number of cars on the road set to quadruple by. 20 50 mega cities such as Los Angeles in Sao Paolo or becoming gridlock and road speeds in London are approximately the same as they were a century goal, 11 miles an hour. If mobility is to remain the lifeblood of our economy, we need smart deliverable solutions. Car sharing pioneered by organizations like Zipcar and buzz car could be one answer. Every shared car takes 15 private cars off the road. Driverless cars are also gaining momentum as a safer cleaner and more efficient way of getting around. A recent study has shown that by managing their own speed, cars increase efficiency by over 40 percent. This number rises to 273 percent. When the cars worked together, their sky Tran, a system of personal jetson's style transit pods set for a trial run in Tel Aviv, gliding above congested streets at 100 miles an hour or faster. They can achieve the equivalent of over 200 miles per us gallon. Not all solutions are high tech shared space projects in city centers, strip away traffic lights along the traditional barriers between vehicles and pedestrians. The result is increased mobility through a sense of shared risk.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Shell is working with partners to innovate mobility. That means moving higher volumes of people and goods safely, cost effectively, and with reduced environmental impact. The Shell Eco Marathon challenges, student engineers and scientists from around the world to design and build vehicles to meet this demand. The prizes are awarded to the teams that go the furthest using the least amount of energy. Shell's scenarios. Team Examines Tomorrow's problems today. Their latest set of scenarios shows that if we build more compact cities, we could reduce car use by around 2000 vehicle kilometers per person per year, and that by 2070 the passenger road market could be nearly oil free.
