Speaker 1:          00:04          The world is more mobile than ever, but increase mobility has also brought congestion, high emissions and poor air quality with a number of cars on the road set to quadruple by. 2050 mega cities such as Los Angeles in Sao Paolo are becoming gridlock and road speeds in London are approximately the same as they were a century ago, 11 miles an hour. If mobility is to remain the lifeblood of our economy, we need smart deliverable solutions. Car sharing pioneered by organizations like Zipcar and buzz car could be one answer. Every shared car takes 15 private cars off the road. Driverless cars are also gaining momentum as a safer, cleaner, and more efficient way of getting around. A recent study has shown that by managing their own speed, cars increase efficiency by over 40% this number rises to 273% when the cars work together, their sky tram, a system of personal jetson style transit pods set for a trial run in Tel Aviv gliding above congested streets at a hundred miles an hour or faster, they can achieve the equivalent of over 200 miles per us gallon. Not all solutions are high tech shared space projects in city centers, strip away traffic lights along the traditional barriers between vehicles and pedestrians. The result is increased mobility through a sense of shared risk.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Shell is working with partners to innovate mobility. That means moving higher volumes of people and goods safely, cost effectively and with reduced environmental impact. The Shell Eco Marathon challenges student engineers and scientists from around the world to design and build vehicles to meet this demand. The prizes are awarded to the teams that go the furthest using the least amount of energy Shell Scenarios Team Examines Tomorrow's problems today. Their latest set of scenarios shows that if we build more compact cities, we could reduce car use by around 2000 vehicle kilometers per person per year, and that by 2070 the passenger rode market could be nearly oil-free.
