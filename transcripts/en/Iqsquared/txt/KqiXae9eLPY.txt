Speaker 1:          00:00          So we really got to gender. I think that, uh, there's been a tremendous change over the last century. It may be the biggest social change in thousands of years of history for thousands of years. You had so many different revolutions, political, social and economic. So many different things changed. But this basic patriarchal structure of most human societies, at least the more the bigger human societies didn't change. And over the last hundred years you see a really fundamental change in the status of women. And in the relation in gender relations in general, it's still very far from being a completely ugly and society and it's questionable whether it, it will be possible ever to have a complete legal in society. But, uh, uh, I wouldn't say that, uh, nothing has been done or accomplished in the last few decades looking to the future. And it's also links to, to the, to the other question, I'm not sure they'll still be genders in 50 or a hundred or a hundred and 50 years.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Uh, with this new ability to re engineered to create bodies and brains and minds as the basic products of the 21st century economy, the most fundamental structures of the human body and mind them themselves might change. So I'm not so sure that 100 years from now people will have a clear agenda of just one gender. Uh, just to give an example of what is starting to happen. Um, in mutual realities, for example, it's very easy for a person to adopt a different gender, a to change genders, to construct all kinds of alternative genders. And you have today like kids, Eh boys will play the role as girls and vice versa. In, as other towns in virtual world today, it's still very primitive. You sit in front of the computer and it's a two dimensional reality. But in 30 years, 50 years, a more and more off life might be transferred into a three dimensional virtual reality, which provides people with far more excitement and far more interest than the drab life in the outside world. In an economy where they are no longer needed. And the political system which we in which they have no power and in such a situation, I mean it's, it's, I wouldn't just take it for granted that the gender structure familiar to us today and for thousands of years in the past will still be relevant in, in 50 or 100 years.
