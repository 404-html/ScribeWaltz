Speaker 1:          00:13          Should we actually be having in our mind the idea of promoting democracy and not necessarily by offering false promises to the people, but by taking on those who are thwarting it or should or is it, is it appropriate for us instead to concentrate on very important point of securing oil, keeping friendly with those who can give the oil on which our economy depends. In other words, have we got our ideals in the wrong order? Do you have a position on whether or not we should actually possibly jeopardize our economic health in favor of the idea of pushing the democracy notion? Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:58          This is a really good question because it shows what the whole problem, the whole problem is that we have created a black and white world in which we imagined that we have to choose all the time either by being Dick Cheney and focused on oil and oppression and plotting up desk bots or on the other hand Amnesty International with absolutely no contact with the world at all. This is not, this is not the choice that we face. This is not what our diplomats are there to do. That's not what our international policy is about. We need to discover how to be pragmatically moral, how to be passionately moderate, how to combine our moral instincts with our interests and being realistic about what we can and can't do. The reason we let people down all the time, the reason we invade these countries and create a mess, the reason we're probably going to do it again for the next 15 years is we have never managed to get a mature conversation going about what we're actually doing and what we can do in these countries were not able to understand firstly that these countries are not our countries, that these countries do have a claim of sovereignty, that they have their own cultures, their own languages, and they don't really like foreigners being in them and that therefore what we do with other people's countries, a bit like what I would do with you if you were my friend has to be limited by respect for other people's autonomy and other people's choice and cannot involve an endless oscillation between black and white.

Speaker 2:          02:28          Assuming that the only choices we face are either oil, well, the most pure conception of our in moral GC.
