Speaker 1:          00:08          How I described the situation is that is the opposition, but is the regime and both are fighting for the power and that the red line in Syria is the power the chair. I don't. I do not see that the red line is neither for the opposition, nor for the regime is the country. The difference is enormous. You can the opposition, they're after power rather the country now it is. It is what we say in Arabic, which means a winning or losing the power. So for me, what I feel is what I. When I look at the opposition, I don't feel they represent me. When I look at the aging, definitely

Speaker 2:          01:02          presenting and that implies a kind of equality kind of parity between the two. Here are these two forces fighting for power. Do you think that's right? Is there a kind of parody between opposition in government in Syria?

Speaker 1:          01:13          I think who is fighting for the country who wants to put the country first rather than the chair rather than grasping the pallet?

Speaker 3:          01:25          I disagree Turkey with what she said simply because there is no real opposition yet that has formed in any political sense, and this is very much to do with the fact that the notion of an opposition has totally obliterated from Syrian polity and Syria and life and Syrian minds. Um, what we have seen over the past year and weeks is the creation of a groundswell movement that has taken over the whole of the country. So it's no longer in humps or in Adelaide or in other areas in Syria. It is everywhere in the country. So this parity, so called parity simply does not exist. And the idea that the opposition is fighting for a chair I think is quite bizarre to me anyway.

Speaker 2:          02:27          Um, let's just hear your view of it because you were there. Yeah, I think it's, it's actually betty, betty simple at the moment, the battle in Syria, the conflict in Syria at the moment, it boils down to one word, and that is actually survival, survival, survival. And that's what people are fighting for. Rob, at this point in time, people are fighting to stay alive. You know, they every tonight nicer indicated no, there was no political push from within Syria. It's a fight to stay alive day to day.
