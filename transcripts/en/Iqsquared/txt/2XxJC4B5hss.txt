Speaker 1:          00:01          But roughly speaking ever since smog, it's natural for every two pounds we pay and we get one pound back in. The one pound we get back is under conditions. So I think we're going to be stronger because our economy is strong. If the vote leave, I think going to be safer because we've got greater control of our borders. Who voted leave and I think we're going to be better off and we're going to be better off because the European Union was created in a time when big trading blox existed. They don't exist anymore. What we've got now is global trading of goods, global trading of services, and we also have global movement of people. None of these things the ear is capable of dealing with. It has outgrown its time. I wish the euro countries well, they need deeper integration. They need it because I don't want how generations of young people to be on a heap of unemployment. I wish them well. I think we're better off to vote. Leave. If we are strong and they're strong than the continent of Europe is strong. If we collectively week that will serve no one. So take control, vote leave.
