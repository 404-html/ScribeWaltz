Speaker 1:          00:01          Quite often when you hear therapists talking about people going through the grieving process, they say that there's a the anger stage, the denial stage, the depression stage, the bargaining stage, and finally the acceptance stage. Most people in this country voted to leave the EU and I think some of the remainers are still at the anger and denial stage. There is a very clear set of ideas as to what we do next. The good Lord may not like them, but I think there are perfectly good arguments in that document which I'd be happy to send you to explain or teachers we can do next. Douglas, can I say that this argument about bereavement is one of the most patched realizing

Speaker 2:          00:45          statements I have ever [inaudible] about this 52

Speaker 1:          00:53          you just said we have democracy where you accept that that is a process. You accept that that means that when it goes against you, you do not start refusing to pay your taxes. You do not have a right to violence or other than unpeaceful demonstrations, but on the day after a Labor government is elected, Tory party activists and and ps decide the very next day that their main aim in life is to make sure that at least within five years that is reversed and the idea that they should go into parliament and vote with the Labor government because that is accepting the will of the people is absurd. I completely accept as a given fact, we are going to leave the European good of you. Youtube, I am complete with that. We are going to lead well when you say it's good to you except that supplies and I wasn't [inaudible] that we shouldn't accept it.

Speaker 1:          01:53          What leads seem to suggest that we shouldn't accept it. What I am suggesting is that it occurred over the next year that there was a turn of events by which on February the 21st next year we had a referendum that went 52 to 48% the other way that would be equally legitimate as the one that went 52 to 48 they say, can referee. I look, oh, you think there is almost no chance of that occurring, but to suggest that it's somehow illegitimate, an undemocratic for some people to want that suggest that he's only really understand democracy having

Speaker 2:          02:30          okay elected.

Speaker 1:          02:34          They're not because I've been appointed that voted for the government in power. Whichever it was. Did you, that was your interpretation of parliament through the ballot box? My Lord, not for appointment. Okay, let me bring in other people. Let me bring in other people. You'll have a chance to come back.
