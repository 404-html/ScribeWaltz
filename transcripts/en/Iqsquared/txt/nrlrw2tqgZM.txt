Speaker 1:          00:00          Well. So who are the chronic for and why is it important for a post 2015 a agreement on sustainable development to think about the chronic coupon there are getting onto a half a billion people who are poor over many years or for a lifetime or possibly pass that property on to their children. And they're trapped in poverty, partly because of politics, partly because of the institutions of the market, which don't operate in their favor. And this isn't just because of a dearth of opportunities or a lack of economic growth, although that is obviously very important. So what does it take to, um, get people permanently out of poverty and address chronic poverty? Uh, and what can an international framework do to help this on its way? It takes good politics, progressive policies to improve the situations of these longterm poor people. Measures like social assistance, seeing children through school for many years, age of pro poorest growth, uh, initiatives and a political society that's, uh, begins to recognize the needs and interests of chronic keep white people.

Speaker 1:          01:18          That doesn't happen very often because chronically bought people don't organize themselves very well. And so they need allies. The international community can be an ally for the chronically poor. They can set, uh, uh, poverty eradication goal and targets, which really address chronic poverty. They can desegregate progress so that we look at the progress made by the bottom 5% 10% 20% of the population. They can, of course, set specific goals, education, seeing children through nine or 10 years of, of education, quality education to help them get out of poverty so they can be a major ally. International community can be a major ally for the chronic important.
