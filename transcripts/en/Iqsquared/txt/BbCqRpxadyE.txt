Speaker 1:          00:17          It is about cultural relativism, that's what this discussion is essentially about Western values as we understand them, not just practiced in the west practice in the large number of places, but usually called Western values and a shared common universal values coming from different traditions and then we can share the meaning of Christianity and other religions and the Jewish tradition. So this is a point which is quite important and it has nothing to do with cultural relativism.

Speaker 2:          01:04          There are no jokes in Islam. As famously said, the West is able to look at his foibles and laugh to make fun of his fundamental principles, but there is no equivalent as yet of monty python's life of Brian. Can we look forward to the life of Mo

Speaker 1:          01:21          when one search this, this notion is ludicrous notion of racial or cultural or value superiority. One is really denying all of the cross cultural wealth of our human legacy. We would, we would throw out half of the poetry of gutter who was inspired by the Persian poet Hafez and then we've. We would, not that anyone here would read it, Bob, but we it ball, who was inspired by Gerta and wrote poems and honor of gotTa. This is a cross cultural that what God himself called the East West Duwan where we could all sit together and exchange our cultures and exchange our values and exchange your ideas. If you go into that table to sit down to dinner with another man and or another woman and say, I am superior. You don't have a dialogue.
