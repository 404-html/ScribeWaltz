Speaker 1:          00:00          What we're seeing. What I'm saying at least is that there should be an evolutionary process to democracy as there was in Hong Kong and you mentioned that in the year 2017 Hong Kong will have universal suffered. I think that remains very much to be seen. I doubt very much whether they will be genuine and one man, one vote, but I would be delighted to be proven wrong. Okay. Can I answer that question? I think it depends on what you mean by democracy. I don't think democracy centers just on one man, one vote. I'm willing to concede that at this stage, maybe one man, one vote is a little too early, but there are the other aspects of democracy which I believe to be important for all nation and for all human beings and that is human dignity, some basic rights and freedoms. The right to participate in the governance, to improve the quality of governance, to have some say in issues that affect their everyday life, to have the rule of law, not the role of men, not rule by law, and to have an independent judiciary that is not subject to the dictates of the one party system rule.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Now, I agree with Martin that in the three 30 years since opened our policy that has been phenomenal economic growth that has been a degree of personal freedom and social mobility. But the sad fact is that in recent years market economy reforms have stalled and the government has backtracked on legal reforms. All judicial organs in China are now subject to the dictates of the one party system rule. Do we seriously thing that the population that the 1.3 billion people in mainland China, I contend to accept this. You say that there are mass support for the one party system role. Why is it then that we get people in from mainland coming to Hong Kong to participate in demonstration, particularly against the blind dissident and the young young who was alleged to have committed suicide
