Speaker 1:          00:10          The tragedy about Pakistan, you see, at least, this is what I say in my book, is that in many ways both democratic or I'd prefer to say civilian government and military governments have failed to develop the country, have both failed to create a more just and equitable system. I mean the most successful as far as economic development was concerned was admittedly a military government that evaluate. But since then, um, Musharraf seemed to be doing quite well in that regard. But much of the growth under Musharraf turned out, unfortunately, to be fairly empty, it was a consumer boom more than anything else. And the key reason for that is that new government has been strong enough because the state itself is not strong enough to change the fundamentals of the society, the domination of kingship, the domination of what are called in Pakistan, feudals the intensely conservative nature of much of society.

Speaker 1:          01:04          The lack of education, the prejudice against education, the lack of women's education in particular, the extremely high birth rate, which tends to swamp every attempt to increase services. Uh, so it's not just the civilian governments have failed a military. Governments have also failed, unfortunately, that's on the other hand and this I think also needs to be brought out very strongly. Uh, they haven't failed completely. The country has stuck together or least the west of it as the east breakaway, uh, and I think it will continue to stick together. And after all, that's quite something given the neighborhood in which it finds itself and the internal strains that it faces

Speaker 2:          01:47          government, which the Americans are keeping in power in Pakistan is one of the most Venal and corrupt governments. We've had these learned nothing from the last time his gang were in bar. I mean, corruption really does ground that country from the top. That's where the fishes Rockman the head and then it seeps downwards. So in order to preserve, and this, he does whatever the U s asks him. The big joke is whether Pakistan ambassador to the United States who's regarded as a well known us agent for the last 25 years, shouldn't more appropriately be the US ambassador to Pakistan.

Speaker 2:          02:34          And these are the questions people ask and, and talk about all the time. I want to introduce a new political culture, democratic culture, and one of the elements is that I cannot put myself as the president, so I would much prefer that I'm going to join the apm as a member and when the membership drive is there and when we form a counsel, let them elect me and tell me whether they want me as president, so therefore I'm going on the part that I will be a member of the PML. Let us see. Then what happens.
