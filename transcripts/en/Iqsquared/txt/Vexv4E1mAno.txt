Speaker 1:          00:00          The green agenda if pressed in competently in political terms with the wrong compelling messages, uh, imposed on people in the wrong ways will actually delay the green revolution. The, and we've just had a perfect example here, but people are saying, oh, we must be very careful about gas expansion and, uh, we've done to shale gas, America's fine, but we didn't want to see too much encouragement here. What is the net effect of that? The net effect is that American code is pouring into Europe. We're burning more color here in this country. Europe's code as a whole is increasing the actual Germans or planning new coal fired stations where s and m c o to welland forming, falling to America to the 20th, 20 year level, lowest level, uh, and the foreign 14% in the last two years. And the per capita emissions has fallen dramatically. So it's not just a recession issue.

Speaker 2:          00:54          Well, I mean, because you have chosen a quite a two year horizon in a time of low us grace. Can I call you on that?

Speaker 1:          01:02          Well, you can call me, but the 57 million extra people in America in the last 20 years, and yet the carbon co two emissions up now 20% down, they are very loud.
