Speaker 1:          00:01          My point of view for what it's worth is that I don't think terrorism is very important and I think we make it important. And by making it important, we make it important. Uh, it does not matter very much. A terrorist incident is happening. It's an accident. It, it affects the people directly affected by it, but terrorism does not threaten states. It doesn't threaten the integrity of America or Britain, that they can't invade us. They can't do serious damage to our economy unless we let them. They cannot affect our values, our democracy, anything like that, unless we let them. Um, they are. They are to all intensive purposes, useless criminals. They simply blow things up and kill people. The early point at which they threatened us is by our reaction to them. They have no standing whatsoever other than in terms of our reaction to them. And our reaction to them is conditioned by the publicity. We give them a, they depend upon publicity. The multiplier publicies what makes the Terrorism Act, terrorist. Otherwise, it's just a killing. That's why very few terrorist incidents occurred in autocratic and dictatorial countries. They don't get any publicity. They get publicity where we give them publicity and it's that publicity that they feed.
