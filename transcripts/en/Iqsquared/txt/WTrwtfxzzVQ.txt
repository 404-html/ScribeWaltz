Speaker 1:          00:00          The National Health Service would be marvelous if they were not political interference so everybody knows the problem and they all send know what the solution is. The solution is decentralization, give power back to the hospitals and the doctors because the secret of the NHS, very curious secret is that it isn't entirely perverse structure. You'll see it's set up as a hierarchical organization of bureaucracy such that the wisdom at the top filters down through the instruments in the middle to achieve the effect you want to achieve at the bottom. Armies are perfect examples of that and that's what Britain did during the war. It's were of course the way in which armies are organized. It's the way in which governments are organized. The point about armies is that they are run by generals and the generals have the brains and the experience to know what they are doing. So an army is a perfect example of an organism in which the brains are at the top and filter through to the actions down below if the general is there any good. The National Health Service is the most peculiar structure in which the brains are at the bottom. That is, say at the top, you have amateurs, politicians, uh, determining these things. And at the bottom, or at least near the bottom, you have the doctors and the nurses and the technicians who actually know something about what is necessary to solve the problems.
