Speaker 1:          00:13          Squared,

Speaker 2:          00:16          welcome to the Royal Geographical Society and it's nice latest intelligence squared debate on democracy in India. India's hailed as the world's biggest democracy and I think it was Hugh Patrick who made the point that every second person in the world living in a democracy is actually living in India, which is quite an astonishing thought, but the question is, what does Indian democracy mean? Is it the glue that holds India together and allows it to flourish and drives it's creativity and vitality? Who is it a curse that's encouraged corruption and social division and perpetuated poverty? Is it India's Achilles heel and that of course is the motion tonight. Democracy is India as a Kelly Kelly's heal, but you will know that because on your way in, you will already be asked to give your initial verdict and I'll give you the results of that initial poll a bit later on. But as you'll know, if you've been to one of these events before, you're also going to be asked to Costco.

Speaker 2:          01:17          Costco, cast your vote again. When we've heard from the speakers to see if their scintillating arguments have swayed you in one way or another, and just a reminder, for those of you who are unfamiliar with the process, what you do is you tell your ticket in half and worked with either the fall or the against slip, so I don't mix them up and if you can't make up your mind then just throw the whole ticket in and register a don't know, vote in the ballot box. Well, it's time to get going. We've only got til 8:30 and I'm going to invite our for debaters to the podium for opening speeches. They know they've each got 10 minutes each and after each speech I'm going to ask the other two on the opposing side to quiz them briefly for just a couple of minutes to give them the first star, but challenging the speaker.
