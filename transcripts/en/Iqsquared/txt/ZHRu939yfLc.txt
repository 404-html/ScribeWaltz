Speaker 1:          00:04          Nuclear power today is available, it produces only very small amounts of very well confined waste and it does not contribute to global warming. This is the reason to better inform the public why I created Efn, the Association of Environmental Guess for Nuclear Energy, which gathers today over 7,000 members and supporters in 53 countries. For more information, you can refer to our website, and this is why, yes, I consider as an environmentalist that nuclear energy must absolutely power our future. Consider this sizewell B, which has already been mentioned in these timeless stores, its own fuel. It has about 300 tons of volatile fuel in a relatively unguarded pond, relatively calm in comparison with other parts of the plant. If the power supply was deliberately isolated from the plants, if the emergency generators were crippled, the water that keeps that fueled cool and relatively stable, what evaporates and the fuel would explode with horrific consequences. Now for me, it's not comforting to think that we'll never more than a few hours away from a nuclear explosion.
