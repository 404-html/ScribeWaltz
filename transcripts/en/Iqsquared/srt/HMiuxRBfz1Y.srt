1
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,380
Can you hear me?
Is it?

2
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,610
Thank you.
Thank you.

3
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,710
Thank you very much all for coming to 
our first debate in,

4
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:45,584
in the series a,
you will know that the title of the 

5
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:51,890
debate is the world needs religion even 
if it doesn't need God.

6
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,743
I don't know what the answer to that is,
but I think that one thing I do know is 

7
00:00:57,621 --> 00:00:58,454
that intelligence squared needs religion
for what has become an almost annual 

8
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:07,050
ritual of debating about it.
Um,

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,460
many of you will have seen,
uh,

10
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,840
some of the those debates and the great 
moments,

11
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:12,674
they've been the Catholic church as a 
force for good atheisms a new 

12
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:17,480
fundamentalism and stop bashing 
Christians.

13
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,583
Um,
they've all been fantastic events and 

14
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,770
this evenings is a,
um,

15
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,650
uh,
is going to add to that great lineage of

16
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:32,651
debates about religion.
Without any further ado,

17
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,320
let me introduce,
let me do one thing first.

18
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,100
Let me tell you about the voting.
You were all polled on the way in,

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,730
on your opinion about this.
At the,

20
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,050
I will announce the initial poll at the 
end of the opening speeches,

21
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,500
and I will,
and you will then be pulled again during

22
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:54,680
the closing speeches that were,
the question will be,

23
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,550
how many minds have been changed by our 
distinguished panel.
