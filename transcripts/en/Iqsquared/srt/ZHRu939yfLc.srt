Nuclear power today is available,
it produces only very small amounts of 

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,670
very well confined waste and it does not
contribute to global warming.

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,710
This is the reason to better inform the 
public why I created Efn,

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,550
the Association of Environmental Guess 
for Nuclear Energy,

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,590
which gathers today over 7,000 members 
and supporters in 53 countries.

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,190
For more information,
you can refer to our website,

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,860
and this is why,
yes,

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,700
I consider as an environmentalist that 
nuclear energy must absolutely power our

9
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:45,540
future.
Consider this sizewell B,

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,390
which has already been mentioned in 
these timeless stores,

11
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:49,224
its own fuel.
It has about 300 tons of volatile fuel 

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,670
in a relatively unguarded pond,
relatively calm in comparison with other

13
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:57,504
parts of the plant.
If the power supply was deliberately 

14
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:01,494
isolated from the plants,
if the emergency generators were 

15
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:04,554
crippled,
the water that keeps that fueled cool 

16
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,524
and relatively stable,
what evaporates and the fuel would 

17
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:13,320
explode with horrific consequences.
Now for me,

18
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:14,154
it's not comforting to think that we'll 
never more than a few hours away from a 

19
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,240
nuclear explosion.
