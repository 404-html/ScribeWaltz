1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,440
The tragedy about Pakistan,
you see,

2
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:14,360
at least,
this is what I say in my book,

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,183
is that in many ways both democratic or 
I'd prefer to say civilian government 

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,500
and military governments have failed to 
develop the country,

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,340
have both failed to create a more just 
and equitable system.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,593
I mean the most successful as far as 
economic development was concerned was 

7
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:34,020
admittedly a military government that 
evaluate.

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,080
But since then,
um,

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,530
Musharraf seemed to be doing quite well 
in that regard.

10
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:41,690
But much of the growth under Musharraf 
turned out,

11
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:43,190
unfortunately,
to be fairly empty,

12
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:45,860
it was a consumer boom more than 
anything else.

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,203
And the key reason for that is that new 
government has been strong enough 

14
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:54,590
because the state itself is not strong 
enough to change the fundamentals of the

15
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:57,530
society,
the domination of kingship,

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,380
the domination of what are called in 
Pakistan,

17
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:04,730
feudals the intensely conservative 
nature of much of society.

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,030
The lack of education,
the prejudice against education,

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,790
the lack of women's education in 
particular,

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,043
the extremely high birth rate,
which tends to swamp every attempt to 

21
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:17,900
increase services.
Uh,

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,850
so it's not just the civilian 
governments have failed a military.

23
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:24,950
Governments have also failed,
unfortunately,

24
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,063
that's on the other hand and this I 
think also needs to be brought out very 

25
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:30,600
strongly.
Uh,

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,633
they haven't failed completely.
The country has stuck together or least 

27
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,740
the west of it as the east breakaway,
uh,

28
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,250
and I think it will continue to stick 
together.

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,233
And after all,
that's quite something given the 

30
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:46,820
neighborhood in which it finds itself 
and the internal strains that it faces

31
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,710
government,
which the Americans are keeping in power

32
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:54,711
in Pakistan is one of the most Venal and
corrupt governments.

33
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:58,720
We've had these learned nothing from the
last time his gang were in bar.

34
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,923
I mean,
corruption really does ground that 

35
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:07,191
country from the top.
That's where the fishes Rockman the head

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,160
and then it seeps downwards.
So in order to preserve,

37
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:17,640
and this,
he does whatever the U s asks him.

38
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,863
The big joke is whether Pakistan 
ambassador to the United States who's 

39
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,770
regarded as a well known us agent for 
the last 25 years,

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,100
shouldn't more appropriately be the US 
ambassador to Pakistan.

41
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,130
And these are the questions people ask 
and,

42
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,103
and talk about all the time.
I want to introduce a new political 

43
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:43,710
culture,
democratic culture,

44
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,650
and one of the elements is that I cannot
put myself as the president,

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,113
so I would much prefer that I'm going to
join the apm as a member and when the 

46
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,350
membership drive is there and when we 
form a counsel,

47
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,820
let them elect me and tell me whether 
they want me as president,

48
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,800
so therefore I'm going on the part that 
I will be a member of the PML.

49
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,530
Let us see.
Then what happens.
