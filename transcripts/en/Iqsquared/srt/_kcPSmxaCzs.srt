1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,800
How many of you believe that nature has 
a balance,

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,090
that nature is this fine,
liberal,

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,623
even beautiful,
complicated tapestry of interrelated 

4
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:15,904
things that all lien one against the 
other and make it all perfect and 

5
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,520
wonderful.
Because if you do,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,330
and it's what George Bailey's is,
you're entirely wrong.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,470
Nature works on Cataclysm and accident.
We all,

8
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:32,980
we are all competitive.
We were born competitive.

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,220
We grew up competitive.
We were evolved from competition.

10
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,210
There is no right way for the world to 
be.

11
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,950
There was no moment where George's world
was just keep it there,

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,520
don't move.
I think that

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,013
there was no marvelous time when the up 
plans with just that nice little bit of 

14
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:59,521
woodiness and not too many festivals and
it didn't exist.

15
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,160
We all get on because something else 
fails.

16
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,700
The natural role in existence is to lead
to extermination.

17
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,343
That's what happens to most things.
We've been immensely successful as a 

18
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:23,060
species.
That's not our fault.

19
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,040
That's our brilliance.

20
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:26,940
Yeah.

21
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,773
What I mind about George's view of the 
world is that there is nature and then 

22
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:35,640
there's us,
there's everything else.

23
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,850
There's all the glory,
and then there's me

24
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,330
greedy,
fat farting.

25
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:53,331
Slovenly slothful,
uncaring twat eating things with eyes.

26
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,330
I am as much part of nature as every 
other species here in this world.

27
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,893
All of us are,
and what I mind about this view of the 

28
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:10,800
way the world works is it stopped me 
being part of my birthright,

29
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,560
which is part of natural selection.
It makes me a fucking zoo keeper,

30
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,620
and I don't want to be a park ranger in 
your park.
