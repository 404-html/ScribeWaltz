Sister wrote,
provide his speeches.

00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:06,060
I think he talks a lot about how you do 
it,

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,790
but he's all terribly dry.
You know,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,870
it's all about,
you know,

5
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:11,610
you start here and you have to have 
this,

6
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,290
and then you had to end with a pair of 
rod here.

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,660
I'm going to try,
you know,

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,150
I'm going to be a girl speaking from the
heart.

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,730
I think the only way to do this is to 
say what I think.

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,750
And Boris,
you know,

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,660
he's really trained in classical 
rhetoric.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,553
That's all he does.
And I think one way you can undermine 

13
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:32,334
those,
those high level rhetoricians is just 

14
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:36,174
going for the juggler.
So I shall try to go for the drug 

15
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:39,114
dealer.
