1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,050
In response to this notion that Syria 
has this mighty formidable army,

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,630
um,
it might be worth asking Paul this,

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:14,703
it took the Syrian,
the mightiest army in the Middle East 

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,123
for weeks of heavy artillery shelling 
and the deployment of 7,000 soldiers to 

5
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:23,284
retake not a city,
but a neighborhood in a city that was 

6
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:26,464
held by a few hundred rebels armed with 
Kalashnikovs hunting rifles and maybe a 

7
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:30,334
few pistols.
That doesn't sound to me like the 

8
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:33,370
mightiest army in the Middle East.
Also,

9
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:35,540
this notion of,
of it's air defense systems,

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,390
we haven't,
we haven't hit on that point yet,

11
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:40,840
but it's been alluded to a especially by
the United States.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,040
This is a can I just make this move?
This is a country that was invaded.

13
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:45,874
It's airspace,
was invaded three times by the Israelis 

14
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:51,550
in the last 20 years and one shot was 
fired against Israeli planes.

15
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,050
Not One plane was,
was shot down.

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,243
And remember one of those sorties 
involved the destruction of a nuclear 

17
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:57,184
facility.
No one even knew Bashar Al Assad was 

18
00:00:58,331 --> 00:00:59,470
building.
So I,

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,230
I take it very skeptically that their 
air defense systems,

20
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:04,930
that their military capabilities are 
quite so robust.

21
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,570
I quite agree with Paul on that point.
And,

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,710
and military defectors.
We'll back you up on this.

23
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,440
By the way,
the paper tiger argument.

24
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:17,470
Smith have a strong Syrian army is 
simply ridiculous.

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,610
This is not an a national army.
This is a sectarian killing machine that

26
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:27,611
has been founded by the ads and that has
been sustained and given a soccer by the

27
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:32,190
secretary and regime.
Alex is 2 million hardcore supporters.

28
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,003
This is a country of 23 million plus.
How can you have a civil war between 2 

29
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,610
million people and 18 million?
That's,

30
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:41,444
I mean the numbers don't work out.
Second thing is that this is an army 

31
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:45,884
that is a conscript army,
so that means that people are forced to 

32
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:50,354
serve in the army.
Those who are serving in the army are 

33
00:01:52,731 --> 00:01:53,564
mainly from the dispossessed.
So knee working class as Malik 

34
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:57,464
described,
they would do anything to affect the 

35
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,960
price of depiction,
as I just said,

36
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,823
is intolerably high.
And that is what needs to be aided 

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,113
because no one is going to die for the 
assads from this point on because they 

38
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:14,414
understand now,
despite the propaganda and propaganda 

39
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:19,880
does work,
the Syrians have 42 years of it.

40
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,040
It does work.
It does brainwash people.

41
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,630
Despite the propaganda people are 
beginning to understand that a regime,

42
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:28,880
the torches children,
gang rapes,

43
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:33,881
girls have 10 by official order that 
trades in the organs of prisoners is not

44
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,660
a regime that you want to die for.
