This photograph here,
you're probably thinking,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,233
why have I shown you a picture of a sort
of a suburban street happens to be in 

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:08,814
Blackpool,
which is quite interesting for this 

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,953
discussion because what it shows us a 
big crack that goes just underneath my 

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,014
name there and that crack was very 
famous in Blackpool for a short time 

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,390
because it purportedly appeared after an
earthquake which was related to fracking

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,820
rather nearby it's fracking for shale 
gas,

8
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:27,654
hydraulic fracturing,
and people said that the fractured 

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,103
appeared the crack it appeared in the 
bridge and people also said that the 

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,433
motorbikes had fallen over and that and 
that traffic lights stopped working and 

11
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:40,560
things like that.
And a lot of people said yes,

12
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:43,680
the crack appeared and it was caused by 
the fracking.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,873
Now the BGS detected this earthquake and
our view was there's no way that the 

14
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:51,680
energy of the earthquake could have 
caused that crack.

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,770
Then.
And in fact,

16
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:55,410
if you read the article which was 
attached to this photograph,

17
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,790
if you've got knocked down to the 
bottom,

18
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:57,624
it said an old black poor man said.
In fact that crack has been there since 

19
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:03,300
1972.
So,

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,471
uh,
but this,

21
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:05,304
this characterizes the argument of shale
gas that there's an awful lot of stuff 

22
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:12,200
going on which you can't tell is true or
false and this,

23
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,810
it's rather got worse.
And unfortunately this is a game,

24
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:17,820
Blackpool,
Blackpool,

25
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:20,460
and uh,
there are people saying on websites that

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,683
Blackpool at the coast of backfill is at
risk of sinking below sea level and our 

27
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:28,380
seat,
a sea defenses will have to be rebuilt.

28
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,423
Essentially.
There is no foundation whatsoever to 

29
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:33,660
this.
It simply won't happen.
