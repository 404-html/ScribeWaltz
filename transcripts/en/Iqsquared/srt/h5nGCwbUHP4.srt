1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,323
I think the idea of a Scandinavian 
entitles lead to have a mill 

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,720
democratized and Monica and my argument 
is simple.

3
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:10,720
If we are to be a modern country in the 
21st century,

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,320
part of various global alliances and 
trading blocks and so on,

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,160
we have to have institutions that match 
that Melbourne position,

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,090
fortune as a half grown stented 
democracy.

7
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:22,924
We take pride in being the mother of 
parliaments and yet we still have a lot 

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,670
of our constitution.
This institution which is hereditary,

9
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:32,710
backward looking medieval.
Now.

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,563
Some of the PR is pretty good.
The forthcoming now reading will excite 

11
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:42,070
people and be no doubt there will be a 
big outpouring of jury on the day,

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,930
but underneath that is the hidden wiring
in the constitution where there are road

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,260
Paris exercise both by the Mahler 
Kendall said by the ministers.

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,393
There is a very obscure system of 
financing the royal family which the 

15
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:57,080
public doesn't understand and isn't 
privy to it.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,620
Secrets.
There's the question of the Commonwealth

17
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:01,750
and why the Queen is head of all these 
other countries,

18
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:02,883
a form of colonial countries out of the 
question of the Church of England and 

19
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,774
why it is that the queen or her 
successes are in charge of the 

20
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,124
Protestant church in the United Kingdom,
so under these issues need to be 

21
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:19,150
ventilated as we move to the road is the
perfect opportunity.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,193
It shouldn't come as a threat to the 
monarchy to have people to say it needs 

23
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,210
to be modernized.
Indeed,

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,970
the only genuine world tradition is 
change.

25
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,450
Real real wisdom requires modernization 
as a whole minutes.

26
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,950
To summarize your
21 century,

27
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,820
a
science fiction,

28
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,603
a festival of a bitch is an example of 
democracy around the world and in 

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,800
particular on the culture down and
it's

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,040
got
good shots to from the monarchy.

31
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,363
He's not under his jurisdiction a pass 
on the separation between the power and 

32
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,630
for my interview view,
the monarchy most change by in and spoke

33
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:25,960
to him.
He's not a politician.

34
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,143
It's not.
