1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,910
So,
which is imperfect.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,330
Guess what?
So is Westminster so's Whitehall.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:08,963
So our political institutions,
I spent five years as deputy prime 

4
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:14,430
minister in White Hall.
At the end of that,

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,010
I came out more antiestablishment than I
went in

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,570
because I saw a poll.
I still am by the secrecy,

7
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:22,404
the overcentralisation,
the of course I say this is a Liberal 

8
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,200
Democrat and they lopsided and 
undemocratic electoral system.

9
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:30,840
We have all of those things I think are 
rubbish.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,720
It's imperfect.
I want to change.

11
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:34,554
But guess what?
I'm not going to say in response to the 

12
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:38,700
imperfections in our own political 
institutions,

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,520
we're going to raise the whole lot to 
the ground and walk off.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,680
You don't do that in life,
do you?

15
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:45,750
When something is imperfect,
you recognize,

16
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:48,600
you try and make it better.
You work with others to do so.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,793
But the idea that you can sort of wash 
your hands of it because you don't like 

18
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,960
its imperfections,
turn your back on it.

19
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:55,920
Pull the drawbridge.
I wish it away.

20
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,300
That's just,
I just don't think that is a practical,

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,920
uh,
response to the realities of the complex

22
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:05,754
and interdependent world.
And the complex and interdependent 

23
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:11,940
European Union and the complex 
institutions that govern it,

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,990
that we,
uh,

25
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,340
that we have here today.
