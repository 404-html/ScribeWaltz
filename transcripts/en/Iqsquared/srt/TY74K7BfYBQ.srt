1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,760
It's almost become an orthodoxy for 
people to say,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,833
oh,
magna Carta is a bit of an irrelevant 

3
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:06,450
piece of Gulf.
Uh,

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,310
I don't think it is irrelevant Gulf.
I think it's very important not for what

5
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,144
it meant in 1215 but for the symbol that
it became and for the significance that 

6
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:23,421
it acquired as part of the common law.
And to give you what seems to me to be a

7
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:25,674
good example,
a blackstone's commentaries on the law 

8
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:32,691
of England,
the classic 18th century text of English

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,223
common law principles published in 1765 
blackstone when considering the notion 

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,363
of absolute fundamental rights under the
English constitution takes us his 

11
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:47,850
starting point.
Magna Carta,

12
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:48,684
which he calls that great charter 
obtained at the point of a sword and he 

13
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:59,100
identifies from magna Carta three 
fundamental rights,

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,173
which actually I think you can discern 
in clause 39 the right to life or 

15
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:05,754
personal autonomy,
the right to liberty and the right to 

16
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:09,780
private property.

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,550
Because what clause 39 says is that you 
cannot apply force to somebody.

18
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:15,384
You cannot exile them.
You cannot take their property and you 

19
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:18,234
cannot imprison them without judgment of
their peers or without the application 

20
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,400
of the law.
And from those,

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,683
from that principal,
he identifies those three fundamental 

22
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:28,590
rights.
And then he says this,

23
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:29,424
he says,
in order for those three fundamental 

24
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:32,364
rights to have any purchase,
they must be supported by ancillary 

25
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:37,404
rights.
And he identifies three of those as 

26
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,374
well.
The first is the rights and privileges 

27
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,374
of parliament.
The second is the limitations on the 

28
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:46,944
royal prerogative and on the executive.
And the third is the right of access to 

29
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,860
justice and the significance of close,
close,

30
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:56,694
40 to no man will we sell,
delay or deny justice is that that 

31
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,440
encapsulates the notion of access to 
justice so that what you have,

32
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:09,441
I think a magna Carta is the kernel of 
two basic constitutional principles.

33
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,053
Firstly,
the rule of law and the protection of 

34
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,570
fundamental rights.
And secondly,

35
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:19,020
the need for access to court to support 
the rule of law.

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,960
And that concept runs through the common
law.

37
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,853
You can see it in modern case law,
important cases like with them about 

38
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,020
access to justice,
medical justice,

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,850
and whether you're actually citing magna
Carta and I ice eyesight,

40
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,713
blackstone's commentaries.
And I've done it in many cases and it 

41
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:40,950
gets much more purchase with a common 
law judge in many occasions.

42
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:45,060
And the Human Rights Act does because 
blackstone's speaks to the breast of the

43
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:45,894
judges in the common law.
And the origin of those principles 

44
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,613
ultimately is a magna Carta.
And if you look at a case like the are 

45
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:52,804
raw we decision that said that the 
common law would not tolerate secret 

46
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:56,574
courts.
That is a passionate declaration by the 

47
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,490
Supreme Court of the importance of basic
principles of open justice,

48
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,430
uh,
which ultimately have their origin,

49
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,383
not in Magna Carta itself,
but in Magna Carta as a symbol as it's 

50
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,800
developed over the following 800 years.
