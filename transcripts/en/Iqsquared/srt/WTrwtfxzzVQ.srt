1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
The National Health Service would be 
marvelous if they were not political 

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:05,034
interference so everybody knows the 
problem and they all send know what the 

3
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:14,280
solution is.
The solution is decentralization,

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,810
give power back to the hospitals and the
doctors because the secret of the NHS,

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,180
very curious secret is that it isn't 
entirely perverse structure.

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,463
You'll see it's set up as a hierarchical
organization of bureaucracy such that 

7
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:37,881
the wisdom at the top filters down 
through the instruments in the middle to

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,310
achieve the effect you want to achieve 
at the bottom.

9
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,580
Armies are perfect examples of that and 
that's what Britain did during the war.

10
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:50,310
It's were of course the way in which 
armies are organized.

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,470
It's the way in which governments are 
organized.

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,573
The point about armies is that they are 
run by generals and the generals have 

13
00:00:56,401 --> 00:01:00,210
the brains and the experience to know 
what they are doing.

14
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,044
So an army is a perfect example of an 
organism in which the brains are at the 

15
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,774
top and filter through to the actions 
down below if the general is there any 

16
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:10,884
good.
The National Health Service is the most 

17
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:16,110
peculiar structure in which the brains 
are at the bottom.

18
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,180
That is,
say at the top,

19
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,580
you have amateurs,
politicians,

20
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,470
uh,
determining these things.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,140
And at the bottom,
or at least near the bottom,

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,183
you have the doctors and the nurses and 
the technicians who actually know 

23
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:34,320
something about what is necessary to 
solve the problems.
