1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,013
Square,

2
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,453
I know that David didn't take up my 
invitation to embarrass himself 

3
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:24,304
politically,
but perhaps you could tackle him 

4
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:30,181
privately afterwards at the bar and I'd 
like to announce the results,

5
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,114
which is

6
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,060
very interesting.

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,163
The number of don't knows,
despite the confusion on the panel has 

8
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:44,111
gone down from 100 to 16
before the debate.

9
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,290
One hundred and 66 people believe that 
the baby boomers,

10
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,630
it's still in the family silver after 
the debate,

11
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,170
only $135 and 235 people no longer 
believe in the motion.

12
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,260
So it's certainly a victory for frank,
for your age and possibly Laurian dead.

13
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,480
Thank you all very much.
Indeed.
