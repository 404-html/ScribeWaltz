Welcome to today's hot topic from 
intelligence squared.com who has got it 

2
00:00:04,731 --> 00:00:07,820
right.
Does liberal democracy need you to get a

3
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:08,654
thick skin or does it need a strong 
state protecting us from extreme verbal 

4
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:13,034
assault?
Here are some highlights from Wendy 

5
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:18,080
kaminer confronting Femi [inaudible] as 
they thrash it out.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,350
We start with femi defending curbs on 
hate speech,

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,103
less,
less hate will be bread and so we would 

8
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:28,904
have less to fear.
I think that hate speech can certainly 

9
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:37,490
be a contributing factor to bigotry and 
prejudice.

10
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:38,210
And I'm,
you know,

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,043
I'm not a,
I'm not here defending the merits of 

12
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:43,670
hate speech,
but I,

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,361
I,
you know,

14
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:47,930
as I said,
I think it is always much more dangerous

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,960
and I also think that it's morally wrong
to criminalize speech that we don't like

16
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,630
because we have some sense that in the 
long run it's,

17
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,690
it's going to be,
it's going to cause decide or harm.

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,940
People should be given the right to 
speak yes to the point where it violates

19
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:12,620
the rights of others.
People may be given the right to express

20
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:17,440
their concerns about principles,
but not about individual characteristics

21
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:18,274
of people.
I personally am grateful and proud to 

22
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:23,324
live in a country and to be part of a 
nation that does not tolerate hate 

23
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:27,944
speech.
And there's anything I would say that 

24
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:33,130
perhaps our restrictions and keeps me in
the UK.

25
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,183
I've go far enough if I can take this 
opportunity to respond quickly to some 

26
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,710
of the things that family.
So first,

27
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:39,544
I,
I really appreciate her forthrightness 

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,290
in questioning why we need to have 
freedom of speech,

29
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:49,510
because that's not a statement that you 
will generally hear from people in the u

30
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:53,360
s to defend hate speech regulation 
because here,

31
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,220
um,
it's,

32
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,100
it's not really so acceptable to say,
I don't believe in free speech.
