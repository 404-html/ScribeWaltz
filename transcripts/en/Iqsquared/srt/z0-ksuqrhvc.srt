1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,473
Square.

2
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,310
Hello,
I'm Dana.

3
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,760
Welcome to this intelligence squared 
debate.

4
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:48,170
It's coming to you from Cadogan Hall in 
central London.

5
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,730
It's exactly 10 years ago that nine 11 
happened.

6
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,983
Nearly 3000 people were killed in those 
attacks in America and they changed the 

7
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:02,870
course of world history forever.
George W.

8
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,990
Bush launched his war on terror in a 
matter of weeks.

9
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,973
Afghanistan was invaded in order to 
remove the Taliban from power who had 

10
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:15,860
harbored al-Qaida.
And then in March,

11
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,590
2003 there was the controversial war in 
Iraq.

12
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,843
The Americans set up Guantanamo Bay as a
detention center to interrogate 

13
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,470
terrorist suspects.
The motion in our debate a decade on was

14
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:35,270
the war on terror,
the right response to nine 11 and in our

15
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:39,560
panel we have some of the key figures 
from that time purveyors,

16
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,450
Musharraf was president of parking

17
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,323
stones.

18
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,110
He is arguing for the motion along with 
colleen graffy,

19
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:54,270
who served in the Bush administration.

20
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,683
Awesome.

21
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,940
Arguing against the motions.
So Jeremy Green Stalk,

22
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:07,610
who was the senior British diplomat at 
the time

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,913
and,

24
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,670
and the influential French politician 
doctor about not [inaudible].

25
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,273
Welcome.

26
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,650
Good luck to you all.
Now before we hear you,

27
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,970
um,
make your opening statement,

28
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,823
it's nice.
You just very quickly run through what 

29
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:37,370
to expect in our debate.
As you,

30
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:41,150
our audience were coming in,
you were almost to vote to see where you

31
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:46,151
stand on the motion right now.
Then each of our panel members will make

32
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:47,144
their opening statements to you.
Then you will have a chance to put 

33
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:56,240
questions or even make comments indeed 
to our panel members.

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,433
After that,
they will make some brief closing 

35
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,003
arguments and we will ask you to vote 
again to see if you've perhaps changed 

36
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:07,120
your mind and where the boat that 
stands.

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,830
So I hope that's all clear.
