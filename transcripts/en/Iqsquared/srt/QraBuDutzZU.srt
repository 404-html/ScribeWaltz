1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,100
Everybody can agree,
especially in England,

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,233
uh,
that this was a crisis whereas the made 

3
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:14,561
in USA label and a,
that we export it or toxic mortgages,

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,820
uh,
that,

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,040
uh,
in fact we send a thank you note all the

6
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,860
time to your for buying so many of our 
toxic mortgages.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,550
We sold about 40 percent of them to 
Europe and,

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,920
uh,
it had it not been for that the downturn

9
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:32,720
in the US would have been much worse.
There were three parts of the response.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,580
The first was a stimulus and when Obama 
got elected,

11
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:39,680
it was good that he finally got around 
to it.

12
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:42,140
Bush didn't,
didn't do anything about this,

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,120
but it was too small and it was not well
designed.

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,410
We're not going to be out of this crisis
very quickly.

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,513
One of the things that will be emerging 
out of this crisis is realization of 

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,340
countries that have bigger reserves did 
better.

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,250
So there'll be an even greater demand 
for savings.

18
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,400
Net will get reduce global aggregate 
demand.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,720
You have failed really to reform our 
global economic system.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,120
We have failed to reform a regulatory 
system,

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,483
failed to provide the kind of economic 
system that would provide stability and 

22
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:20,600
security,
and the result would add is that,

23
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,463
uh,
these economic weaknesses are going to 

24
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:24,584
persist.
Do you think the American tax payer has 

25
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:31,241
been ripped off in essence by the band 
out of the American taxpayer,

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,470
very clear,
got treated very badly.

27
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,500
The typical pattern in the chaos of a 
crisis.

28
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:39,843
Uh,
the bankers who caused the crisis than 

29
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,510
steal money massively because people 
aren't noticing that.

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,770
And I said,
Oh God,

31
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:49,600
this is going to happen again in the 
United States.

32
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:50,434
I hoped that we had better institutions,
but what it turned out is that we had 

33
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:55,564
better mechanism for theft.
It's such an elementary issue of 

34
00:01:58,031 --> 00:01:58,864
incentives.

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,793
If you're too big to fail,
then you have incentive to gamble 

36
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:06,040
because if you gamble and when you walk 
off with the prophets,

37
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:06,874
even gamble and lose,
the government picks up the tab a why 

38
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:13,810
not gamble?
I think the UK did a much,

39
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,520
much better in three ways.
First,

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,870
uh,
you,

41
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,690
you had some sense of accountability 
that you,

42
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,320
some of the ceos had to go.
Secondly,

43
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,120
you put some conditions,
we didn't put any condition,

44
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:26,954
so we allow the money to pour in and 
pour out and we gave the story that we 

45
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:34,120
had to recapitalize the banks in order 
to help them land.

46
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,120
But if money is pouring in and pouring,
oh,

47
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,540
that's not recapitalizing the banks.
Thirdly,

48
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,613
you tried a wasn't totally successful,
but you understood you wanted the banks 

49
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:50,680
to start lending and you try to get some
incentives,

50
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:54,880
some institutional reforms to get the 
banks to land the criticism,

51
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,920
the somewhere I work that I don't 
understand.

52
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,340
You know,
I,

53
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,340
I very good at identifying a market 
failure,

54
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:07,000
but I'm a little bit less students in 
and talking about government failure.

55
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,110
Uh,
let me say that anybody in America lived

56
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:13,750
through the Bush administration,
understands government failure.

57
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,350
We have to think much more carefully 
about how we spend money.

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,800
So I'm very critical of the hundreds of 
billions of dollars that we spend in the

59
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,351
United States.
Um,

60
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:26,140
weapons that don't work against enemies 
that don't exist.

61
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,303
Um,
we get neither security nor economic 

62
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,500
growth.
So that seems to me a,

63
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:36,610
a good target for cutting.
And we disagree allocating that money to

64
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:37,444
investments that will lead to higher 
growth and therefore lower a national 

65
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:42,340
debt in the long run.
