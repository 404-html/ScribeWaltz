1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,033
Just having read,
having heard a bit of Satan tonight and 

2
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:03,704
having read a bit of Macbeth,
that there's a thing when you play a 

3
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:12,050
Baddie in Shakespeare where you can be 
sympathetic,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,470
you can be,
you know,

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,323
we have Patrick Stewart playing a 
sympathetic child murderer in the west 

6
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:18,134
end on the same day that we feel our 
front pages of the tabloids with 

7
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:24,950
terrible things about child murder.
It's a very odd,

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,540
I'm a coexistence,
but you,

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,610
you have to leap the tragedy.
Train at some point as an audience,

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,030
as it careers towards the,
the bloody buffers.

11
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,283
You have to lose sympathy for him,
however much he carries you along 

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,413
because he's going to be damned.
That doesn't happen with Satan because 

13
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:49,064
he's not human.
What's the worst thing that can happen 

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,430
too?
It's already happened.

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,400
And so Milton,
it struck me tonight,

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,263
has done a sort of extraordinarily 
extraordinary high jump imaginatively 

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,500
and morally.
He's,

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,640
he's given you this person who has all 
the best shoes.

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,270
I've given you sympathy for the devil.
Um,

20
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,700
which is also a great team.

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,280
Uh Huh.

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,453
And then he sort of made it impossible 
for you to withdraw your sympathy from 

23
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:18,160
him because he's so clearly having a 
worse time than you are.

24
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,960
And I'm not sure Shakespeare never quite
does that.

25
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,403
Um,
and I just wanted to say that I think 

26
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:26,914
it's,
um,

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,140
it's,
it gives you quite a sort of vertigo,

28
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,360
morally,
and that's extraordinary.
