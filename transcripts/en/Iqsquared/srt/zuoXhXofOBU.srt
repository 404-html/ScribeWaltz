1
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,593
Squared,

2
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,503
welcome to the Royal Geographical 
Society and it's nice latest 

3
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:23,450
intelligence squared debate on democracy
in India.

4
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,823
India's hailed as the world's biggest 
democracy and I think it was Hugh 

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,393
Patrick who made the point that every 
second person in the world living in a 

6
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:37,220
democracy is actually living in India,
which is quite an astonishing thought,

7
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:40,700
but the question is,
what does Indian democracy mean?

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,093
Is it the glue that holds India together
and allows it to flourish and drives 

9
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:47,174
it's creativity and vitality?
Who is it a curse that's encouraged 

10
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,800
corruption and social division and 
perpetuated poverty?

11
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,360
Is it India's Achilles heel and that of 
course is the motion tonight.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,180
Democracy is India as a Kelly Kelly's 
heal,

13
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,300
but you will know that because on your 
way in,

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,313
you will already be asked to give your 
initial verdict and I'll give you the 

15
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:12,500
results of that initial poll a bit later
on.

16
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,723
But as you'll know,
if you've been to one of these events 

17
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:17,020
before,
you're also going to be asked to Costco.

18
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,650
Costco,
cast your vote again.

19
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:19,484
When we've heard from the speakers to 
see if their scintillating arguments 

20
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:25,400
have swayed you in one way or another,
and just a reminder,

21
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:27,740
for those of you who are unfamiliar with
the process,

22
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,783
what you do is you tell your ticket in 
half and worked with either the fall or 

23
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:33,014
the against slip,
so I don't mix them up and if you can't 

24
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:36,644
make up your mind then just throw the 
whole ticket in and register a don't 

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,240
know,
vote in the ballot box.

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,550
Well,
it's time to get going.

27
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:44,384
We've only got til 8:30 and I'm going to
invite our for debaters to the podium 

28
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:48,974
for opening speeches.
They know they've each got 10 minutes 

29
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:52,214
each and after each speech I'm going to 
ask the other two on the opposing side 

30
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,210
to quiz them briefly for just a couple 
of minutes to give them the first star,

31
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,050
but challenging the speaker.
