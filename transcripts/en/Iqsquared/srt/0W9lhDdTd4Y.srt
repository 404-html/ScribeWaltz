1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,420
The idea that the benefit system 
perpetuates misery is not something that

2
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:11,421
I'm a stranger to have everyday when I 
knocked doors as has been highlighted in

3
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:15,120
areas where people are struggling,
are in work and are struggling,

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,993
they will point out their neighbors to 
me about how they're wrong ends and she 

5
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:20,094
never goes out to work and he doesn't go
out to work and the kids are in the 

6
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:27,000
garden and that was always a perception 
that there is somebody next door getting

7
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:30,810
something that you are not getting.
So I asked the people.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,870
My response is always would you swap 
places?

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,633
It's so easy for them.
You're going out to work their lives 

10
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:39,090
really easy.
Would you go?

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,760
Would you swap places?
And the answer is all,

12
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:42,594
of course not.
So what makes you think those people 

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,630
chose it?
Either.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,763
What makes you think your life is is so 
different to theirs that they chose 

15
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:54,840
something completely different to you?
There are many reasons why people end up

16
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:57,660
with benefits and the lady in the 
audience has highlighted one of them.

17
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,763
We should stop treating these people 
like they are not like us because one 

18
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:02,784
day they will.
We all of us will fall and need the 

19
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:08,550
benefits system if we haven't already.
