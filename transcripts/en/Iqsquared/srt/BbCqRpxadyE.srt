00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,113
It is about cultural relativism,
that's what this discussion is 

2
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:25,680
essentially about Western values as we 
understand them,

3
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,030
not just practiced in the west practice 
in the large number of places,

4
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:30,864
but usually called Western values and a 
shared common universal values coming 

5
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:38,190
from different traditions and then we 
can share

6
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,720
the meaning of
Christianity and other religions and the

7
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,554
Jewish tradition.
So this is a point which is quite 

8
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:03,480
important and it has nothing to do with 
cultural relativism.

9
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,040
There are no jokes in Islam.
As famously said,

10
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,720
the West is able to look at his foibles 
and laugh to make fun of his fundamental

11
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:13,554
principles,
but there is no equivalent as yet of 

12
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:20,460
monty python's life of Brian.
Can we look forward to the life of Mo

13
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,883
when one search this,
this notion is ludicrous notion of 

14
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:25,514
racial or cultural or value superiority.
One is really denying all of the cross 

15
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,840
cultural wealth of our human legacy.
We would,

16
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,823
we would throw out half of the poetry of
gutter who was inspired by the Persian 

17
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,040
poet Hafez and then we've.
We would,

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,930
not that anyone here would read it,
Bob,

19
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,783
but we it ball,
who was inspired by Gerta and wrote 

20
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:49,934
poems and honor of gotTa.
This is a cross cultural that what God 

21
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,793
himself called the East West Duwan where
we could all sit together and exchange 

22
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,540
our cultures and exchange our values and
exchange your ideas.

23
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,553
If you go into that table to sit down to
dinner with another man and or another 

24
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:06,170
woman and say,
I am superior.

25
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,490
You don't have a dialogue.
