1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,910
I agree that there is a lot wrong with 
Iran.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,570
It's hostility to Israel.
It's appalling human rights record,

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,673
but I doubt that that record is worse 
than that of Egypt or Saudi Arabia and 

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,170
we don't hear much from the West about 
that.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,120
Thank you,

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,153
but there is another side to Iran.
The revolutionaries are growing older 

7
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:26,194
and have a country to run.
It is a country with significant 

8
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:29,624
elements of democracy.
It has a large Christian population and 

9
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:34,184
also a significant Jewish population,
the largest but small Jewish population 

10
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:39,974
in the Middle East,
outside Israel that even represented in 

11
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:43,394
the Iranian parliament.
Iran has made overtures in the past 

12
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:50,690
about improving relations with the West 
in 2003.

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,130
It supported the American invasion of 
Afghanistan at the same time.

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,293
It proposed normalizing relations with 
us and he offered to rein back at 

15
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,163
support for Hezbollah and Hamas and 
there's Jack Straw said all it got was 

16
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,680
to be called part of the access for 
evil.

17
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,630
Iran unfortunately has many reasons to 
be distrustful of the West,

18
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,003
the coup against Dr Moosa Deck simply 
because he wanted to run soil for Iran 

19
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:20,474
rather than for UK.
Are maintaining the shine power along 

20
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:29,051
with the notorious,
most most sad supported secret police in

21
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:30,434
1983 of us shot down in Iranian civil 
airliner killing 290 people and then 

22
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:40,550
there was the help the west gave Sudan 
was saying when he invaded in Iran,

23
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:45,620
it's impossible to understand the 
security insecurity and the mentality of

24
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:46,454
Iran without understanding the Iran Iraq
war and the fact that they lost almost 

25
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:55,421
as many people in that war as we lost in
the Second World War Iran.

26
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,520
Iran is not going to become the ally of 
the West overnight,

27
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:04,354
if at all,
but there are common interests that we 

28
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:11,341
have like fighting the Islamic state.
Iranians are not apocalyptic millenarian

29
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:13,804
madmen wanting to blow the world up.
I believe that this deal gives us the 

30
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,370
best hope of improving relations with 
Iran.

31
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,503
We have surely learned enough from our 
disasters actions in the past to prefer 

32
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:28,334
a negotiated settlement rather than to 
push us yet again into another 

33
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,450
catastrophic war in the Middle East.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,650
Thank you.
