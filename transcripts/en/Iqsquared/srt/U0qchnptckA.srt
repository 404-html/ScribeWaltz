1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,500
What did the Romans do to democracy?
My friends,

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,323
what do they do?
They abolished it in favor of a 

3
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:10,464
dictatorship.
Then the imperial system and why with 

4
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:15,570
the word Raymond's not much good at 
drama.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,433
Why won't they?
Much interested in drama where the 

6
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:17,964
tragic or comic,
but it's fundamentally the whole 

7
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:26,470
audience was forever being dragged off 
to another entertainment,

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,573
the games and watching people and 
animals being smothered in a dupree 

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,490
ritual that was endemic in the Roman 
world and virtually absent from Greece.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,503
How many people died in that building 
that is emblematic still a raymond 

11
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:43,420
culture and civilization.
The called the coliseum.

12
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:46,840
How many people were killed in it?
Probably 200,000.

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,830
The Greeks like the happy release of the
theater,

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,993
the Roman idea of good family 
entertainment was cutting the feet of 

15
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:03,211
some poor fif coating his stumps with 
honey and letting the bas do the rest,

16
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,503
I'm afraid,
but in many ways the Romans were 

17
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,203
Boston's
whipped and brutalized as children that 

18
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:12,424
they'd like to inflict pain themselves.
What's the most famous image from all 

19
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,973
the frescoes of pompey?
It's one of the women whipping each 

20
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:19,810
other.
What happens?

21
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:21,970
Importance in terrorists instead of 
jokes.

22
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:26,971
People hate to be float.
It was a society not based on democracy,

23
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,900
but on fear.
