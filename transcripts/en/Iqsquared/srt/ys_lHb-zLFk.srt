00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,603
What'd you think you found in the 
Arabian nights to continue with the 

2
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:11,394
young man?
Magic

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,230
world needs more of it.
Favoritism.

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,640
That's really very,
it's very cool.

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,310
The roof,
the poor cobbler and the gin comes up to

6
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:34,311
meet him in the desert.
I used to be able to visualize things.

7
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,310
I was reading,
even homer,

8
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,093
I worked out that the,
the tense of the grapes on the shore 

9
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,023
were black,
and then I've asked an expert on tents 

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,230
and stuff.
I think they were too.

11
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,843
It's,
I have one of those weird sort of 

12
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,483
memories that I can start to visualize 
almost anything correctly or 

13
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:06,900
incorrectly.
It doesn't matter.

14
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,370
It's just,
they're

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,220
just adds to the joy
and hope met them.

16
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,283
Hope.
