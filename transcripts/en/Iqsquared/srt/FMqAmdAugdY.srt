00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,013
I'd like to share briefly with you 
before concluding some of the work that 

2
00:00:03,181 --> 00:00:07,680
we've been doing on urban China.
By the end of 2010,

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,550
the Chinese urban population was existed
estimated,

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,640
excuse me,
at 660 million people by 20,

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,843
30,
and additional 300 million people are 

6
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:26,841
expected to have joined the urban ranks 
of China by my by migration or birth.

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,190
Now,
according to Mckinsey,

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,580
as many as a quarter of total global 
growth in liquid fuel demand in the next

9
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:40,380
20 years is expected just to come from 
China's cities.

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,953
Shell's been working in China for some 
time and we've recently considered 

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,403
urbanization there as part of a project 
which is looked more broadly at the 

12
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:53,310
future energy needs of the country.
And one of the key insights,

13
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:54,144
and I think one of the most exciting 
things that that study was able to find 

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,533
is that by focusing on density alone are
in small to medium sized cities and 

15
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:02,814
we're talking about creating a density 
roughly equal to the average density of 

16
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:07,674
London or or the density of Paris.
It could be possible to contain all 

17
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:12,900
urban growth in China.
To 20,

18
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:13,734
30 within the existing urban footprint,
and we looked at something like 480 

19
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:22,020
cities have of 100,000 to half a million
people,

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,103
uh,
in looking at this and that move alone 

21
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:25,674
would save an estimated 75,000 square 
kilometers of arable land in a country 

22
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:31,044
which is crying out for arable land.
And that's an area almost the size of 

23
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:35,940
Scotland.
And in doing so,

24
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:36,774
it would create the conditions by which 
energy could be reduced and emissions 

25
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:41,214
impacted.
