1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,470
But John,
in 1997,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:07,530
the NHS budget was 33 point 5 billion in
2010.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,550
It was 115 billion.
What's that?

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,020
Is that not a triplet?
You're doing cash to carry.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,023
Do it in real terms.
You're not going to be used in real 

6
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:20,500
terms.
I've talked about the NHS budget.

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,100
Are you talking about cash?
Are you talking?

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,790
You don't talk in real terms,
in real terms,

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,790
budgets.
See,

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,000
this is the whole problem with arguing 
with this exact problem.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,220
My family stays on you.
This is the whole problem which the book

12
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:36,730
cuts through every time one says 
something,

13
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:37,564
which is based on the fact the 
government publishes the statistics say 

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,240
the government spending on nhs,
it seems simple,

15
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:47,880
is 33 point 5 billion and in 2010 is 
over 110 billion.

16
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,023
There is no dispute about that and yet 
the moment labor people of their rights 

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,600
get a fat,
they try and twist and turn it so that,

18
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:56,434
for example,
now when Professor Brown eloquently 

19
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:01,450
explained the decline of math education 
in Britain,

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,020
matthew immediately jumped to say,
well,

21
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,590
it's because the housing problem.
This is the problem.
