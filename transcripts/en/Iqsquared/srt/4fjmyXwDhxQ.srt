1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Now you have a statistic in my book 
where I mentioned that it was the 

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:05,304
average income of the parents of our 
value university undergrad students 

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,183
right now corresponds to the average 
income of the top two percent of the US 

4
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:17,154
distribution of family income.
So this doesn't mean that everybody at 

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,500
outcomes from the two percent,
you have some people who come from below

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,373
youtube too,
but there are so few and so people who 

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,383
come from the top two are so that the 
overall average is as if all students 

8
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:35,220
had been picked up from them within the 
top two.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,383
I think this is an example where the gap
between the official discourse based on 

10
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:46,191
meritocracy call opportunity,
mobility of us society,

11
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,090
et Cetera,
et cetera.

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,043
And the reality is particularly strong.
So I think there's a lot of fight crazy 

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,330
basie elite not only in the US but also 
in my country in France.

14
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,163
You know,
we don't have this very high tuition 

15
00:00:59,101 --> 00:00:59,934
fees,
but we are sometimes able to put the 

16
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,693
five times more public resources in the 
schools where the children of the elite 

17
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:08,610
go to as compared to the.
So you know,

18
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:13,611
in every country there's a lot of 
hypocrisy about equal opportunity and an

19
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:20,031
incredible abilities and time of the 
elite to justify inequality as fair when

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,433
it is not fair.
And I think what's important is to put 

21
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:29,410
all these claims under public scrutiny 
and to have more transparency,

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,413
not only about income and wealth,
but also about who benefits from what 

23
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,740
public spendings so that we can adapt 
our policies.
