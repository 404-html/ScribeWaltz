1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,130
Cori,
what about you,

2
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:01,964
do you think it could have evolved in an
entirely different way and retain some 

3
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:08,660
of that openness and sense of boundless 
freedom there?

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:09,831
Well,
I mean,

5
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:11,930
I'm not a historical determinists,
so yes,

6
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:12,764
of course,
lots of different things could have 

7
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:14,420
happened.
Yeah,

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,170
I mean I believe in the adjacent 
possible so people have ideas for things

9
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:22,160
like airplanes at periodic intervals 
through the whole of human history.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,233
But eventually some of those ideas get 
realized because we have material 

11
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:27,230
science and physics to kind of catch up 
with it,

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,273
which is what,
when people say you get railroads when 

13
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:30,554
it's railroading time,
they don't mean that there's a mystical 

14
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,690
railroading energy in the air.
They just mean that we have now attained

15
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:39,830
the point where when that idea occurs 
with it's on scheduled regularity,

16
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,070
that's some of the people to whom it 
occurs will be able to figure out how to

17
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:43,880
make it a reality.

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,713
So I don't think we run on rails.
I think we have lots of moments in our 

19
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:50,780
history where things have gone well and 
somewhere they've gone poorly.

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,320
When the robot web consortium,
uh,

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,350
decided that members who participated in
standard setting would have to have your

22
00:00:57,351 --> 00:00:58,184
web patents,
so there would be no tollgates for 

23
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:03,110
producing web technology.
That was a key juncture.

24
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,690
I could have gone a different way.
It could have been much worse.

25
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,603
But on the other hand,
when the Digital Millennium Copyright 

26
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,813
Act was passed in 98,
and when the European Union copyright 

27
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:18,350
directive was passed in 2001,
both of them produce extraordinarily bad

28
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:23,351
policy that if we hadn't had it,
I think things would be much better.

29
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:25,520
They both provide for,
among other things,

30
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,563
an unaccountable system of arbitrary 
censorship and a rule prohibiting a 

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,430
disclosing security vulnerabilities in 
technologies that we rely on which could

32
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:35,750
have produced,
uh,

33
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,643
which,
which does present a clear and present 

34
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:38,984
danger to us.
Which is only gonna get worse unless we 

35
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:42,080
can do something about it.
