1
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,413
This,
this interest in mania as this interest 

2
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,210
in these levees,
where did all this come from?

3
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,530
What's there?
Can you go back maybe to an earlier time

4
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:34,060
where this kind of an obsession or took 
hold the view?

5
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:35,651
Well,
it's,

6
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:36,484
I wouldn't call it an obsession because 
it would be a wrong description of 

7
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:42,460
myself to be obsessive.
I'm not,

8
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,900
I'm just very calm and I'm trying to be 
a thinking men and people always think I

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,700
this madman in this obsessed and he must
be insane.

10
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,420
I didn't take,
I didn't know,

11
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,540
but I know what's out there.
I know,

12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,403
I know all the top locking us out there.
And I have to say I'm the only one 

13
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:04,510
probably in southern England who is 
clinically sane.

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,900
So one example.
All right.

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,871
Yeah,
no,

16
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,150
but uh,
how to,

17
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,080
how can I describe it?
It in a,

18
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:18,790
in a way possibly dated back to my 
childhood,

19
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,653
which is spent in the,
in a very remote mountain village in 

20
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:24,550
Bavaria.

21
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,620
You moved when you were three,
four days old now,

22
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,403
10 or 14 days old and bombs hit Munich 
and my mother fled because of bomb 

23
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:34,963
pettit right next to our place.
And then you went to this tiny town of 

24
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,340
Zach's suck cornea,
which is not even a town.

25
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:46,000
It's a tiny village and devastate a 
farmhouse outside,

26
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,350
outside of Saffron.
And that's where I grew up.

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,610
And of course I had no idea of the world
outside.

28
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,630
As you know,
I had never seen cinema until I was 11 I

29
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:02,980
didn't even know that cinema existed.
And in his children,

30
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,230
his children,
we had nothing.

31
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:07,450
I mean we were,
we were always very hungry.

32
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:09,910
That's must one side.
But it didn't really matter.

33
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,820
It mattered to the mothers.
It was very,

34
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:17,170
very hard for the mother to not be able 
to feed the children.

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,440
But we had no toys and we had no games 
and we had to invent to games.

36
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,470
And you found you found toys?
Yeah,

37
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:29,650
well found toys.
I wouldn't call it toys with toys.

38
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:33,600
We found weapons.
We found live and ammunition mission and

39
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,410
pursue costs and things like this.
And you've,

40
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,150
you've spoken about that moment in time 
as a,

41
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:44,080
as a happy moment in [inaudible] was 
very happy,

42
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,943
very wonderful childhood with my 
brothers and other refugee children and 

43
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:52,210
farm children around.
And we were getting a 14,

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,210
actually 13 and one girl,
uh,

45
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,253
she,
she was always with us and she was the 

46
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:03,301
rowdiest the most true,
mostly independent and in courageous of,

47
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:06,310
of us all.
And,

48
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,110
um,
yeah.

49
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,360
And of course,
I dreamt of,

50
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,800
um,
uh,

51
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:16,801
of shooting a crow because I had seen 
the route workers who had shot a crow.

52
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:18,544
Nobody had anything to eat,
and they pluck the feathers and they 

53
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:22,630
cooked it.
And there was,

54
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,460
there was on,
on,

55
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,240
uh,
on the top of the soup there was,

56
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,840
as we called it,
ice of fat floating,

57
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:35,770
which was sensational.
And we were hungry and I wanted to shoot

58
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:39,070
a crow,
but I'd never managed to the machine.

59
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:43,120
Submachine gun was too,
too unruly.

60
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,373
But,
uh.
