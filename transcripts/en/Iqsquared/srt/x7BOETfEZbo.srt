1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,653
We must reject,
I would say fundamentally the idea of 

2
00:00:07,571 --> 00:00:11,230
those deportations to torture it doesn't
work.

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,520
It undermines the very values that we 
are fighting to defend.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,193
It undermines democracy,
the rule of law and basic human rights 

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,513
and human rights,
all the only universal language of 

6
00:00:24,461 --> 00:00:25,294
mankind that transcends national 
identity that transcends religious and 

7
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:33,340
cultural differences.
If we start losing them,

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,890
we have no language and they're basic 
principles,

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:36,903
the to talk to other people in other 
cultures and other nations in other 

10
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:45,940
racial groups for if we started 
abandoning them and then they'll say,

11
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:49,030
you've got no moral authority at all to 
preach to us,

12
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:52,660
to talk to us or to tell us.
So I asked you to vote for justice.

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,763
I asked you to vote for reason.
I asked you to vote against rough 

14
00:00:56,471 --> 00:00:57,304
justice,
vote with our House of Lords in 

15
00:00:58,841 --> 00:00:59,674
rejecting Belmarsh vote with our mps in 
rejecting the 90 days and say no to 

16
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:05,824
rough justice.

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,450
Thank you.
