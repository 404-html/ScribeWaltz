1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,590
[inaudible].

2
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,450
Good evening.
Good evening ladies and gentleman.

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,353
This evening is all about cycling,
so you might be wondering what a mere 

4
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:33,170
her telia is doing here,
sharing this event.

5
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,800
But I am a very keen cyclist.
Um,

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,113
I got into cycling through triathlon,
which I took happy living 11 years ago 

7
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,430
and,
uh,

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,533
cycling is a discipline I really like 
mirrors and I think I'll give the other 

9
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,550
two are,
uh,

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,290
very soon.
Um,

11
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,010
to be a keen cyclist,
you've got to be a bit of a masochist.

12
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,050
All cyclists keen sight is like riding 
up hills as fast as they,

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,750
uh,
as like as,

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,540
as they can and uh,
and uh,

15
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,780
no exception.
But the thing that,

16
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:09,650
uh,
that I feel when I cycle,

17
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:14,170
I feel at one with the elements and I 
feel a real feeling of par.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,640
Uh,
and that's what really gets to me.

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,200
Uh,
anyway,

20
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:18,890
the,
uh,

21
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,580
we've got six great speakers here this 
evening.

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,360
They're going to have 12 minutes each to
speak.

23
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,120
After 10 minutes,
I'm going to give them a warning,

24
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,550
a warning bell,
uh,

25
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,220
at the end of the,
uh,

26
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,083
the f six presentations.
There'll be time for questions about 20 

27
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:38,550
minutes.
Uh,

28
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:43,130
so I hope you'll have a lot of questions
to ask.

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,473
So without any more ado,
we'll go onto to the first speaker who 

30
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:50,790
is a prolific author,
a,

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,480
she's called Bella bathurst.
And,

32
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:55,450
uh,
her latest book is a,

33
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:56,550
is a public,
uh,

34
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,580
is,
is a book called the,

35
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,060
the bicycle book.
Very appropriately Bella

36
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,110
[inaudible].
