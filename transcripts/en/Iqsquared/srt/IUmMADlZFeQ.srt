1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Yeah,

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,163
in March last year,
intelligence squared discussed the 

3
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:14,954
future of Afghanistan and what the West 
should be doing that if anything 

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,693
tonight,
we tackle an even more difficult and 

5
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:26,471
more dangerous situation in Pakistan,
born in the trauma of the petitioner,

6
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:27,524
British colonial India in 1947.
Pakistan has since then struggled to 

7
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:32,354
match what many Pakistan is regard as 
its enemy India only in the possession 

8
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:39,470
of nuclear weapons.
Can Pakistan claim parity?

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,813
Otherwise it's progress has been holding
democratic government in Pakistan has 

10
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:45,194
often been interrupted by military rule 
and half the country was torn away when 

11
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:50,750
because of India's military 
intervention.

12
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,040
East Pakistan became the independent 
state of Bangladesh.

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,683
Now Pakistan is caught up in the west 
battle with violent Islamist from the 

14
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:04,781
tribal areas that border Afghanistan.
Pakistan has become by common consent.

15
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,290
The worlds tend to box for while it's 
government is allied to the west.

16
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,410
It's population is seating with 
anti-americanism.

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,390
So what happens now?
Pakistan,

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,710
what next?
To answer that question in own way,

19
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,560
we've seven people highly qualified to 
give us their opinion.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,470
Each of them will speak from maximum of 
nine minutes.

21
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:25,304
Before I take your questions from the 
floor and also from viewers around the 

22
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:29,474
world at the end,
our speakers will sum up very briefly 

23
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:32,864
indeed,
and I'll hope to put a question to you 

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,353
for sure.
I've had.
