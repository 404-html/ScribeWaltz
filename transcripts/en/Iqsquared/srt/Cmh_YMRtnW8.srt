1
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,983
Square,

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,600
say something about your relationship 
with your father when there was not much

3
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:27,890
of a relationship because he was always 
absent.

4
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,610
My parents divorced very early on and he
was,

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,140
he lived in a,
in a world of after the collapse of,

6
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,960
of Germany and the destruction of 
Germany.

7
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:42,600
He fled into,
into,

8
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:43,260
uh,
uh,

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,093
his kingdom of fantasies and he 
fantasized about writing a universal 

10
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:50,064
study and he had to study a.
He actually studied biology and history 

11
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:59,571
and psychology and he spoke eight or 
nine languages including Japanese and he

12
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:00,864
refused to work and he refused to earn 
money because he was working on the 

13
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:06,654
study in his wife's,
always had his women always had to earn 

14
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:12,324
money and race of children and cook the 
food and he was resting and taking 

15
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,740
notes.
He never wrote one page.

16
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,210
What influence did it never wrote?
One page.

17
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,363
I also know that the Dalai Lama told you
that every person is at the center of 

18
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:34,071
their own universe and you replied
that you have to add.

19
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,410
He said,
well,

20
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:41,720
in that definition I would be the center
of the university laughs.

21
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:42,554
And he says,
and you would be the center of the 

22
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:46,320
universe,
and youth said,

23
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,000
well,
without missing a beat,

24
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:49,470
I said,
your holiness,

25
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:54,471
please don't tell that to my wife.
So by the way,

26
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,340
yes,
people always a,

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,600
it starts out that,
uh,

28
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,830
we are talking about some obsessions now
more than any obsessions or anything.

29
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:08,130
There's humane may films including even 
to our,

30
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:08,964
started small,
but it's a very dark sort of humane in 

31
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,410
the bad lieutenant.
Audiences laugh more than in a,

32
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:19,350
in a fred,
Eddie Murphy comedy.

33
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,380
They laugh from the first til the last 
minute.

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,040
And this is wonderful to see that people
finally accept my kind of humor.

35
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,210
And I really liked it.
I think you're pretty funny.

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,733
No,
no,

37
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,310
I'm not a.
How should I say?

38
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,563
I have,
I certainly have humane and it should 

39
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,810
not be overlooked.
