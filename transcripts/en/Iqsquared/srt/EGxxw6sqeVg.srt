1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,153
I know we only still sort of the house 
were absolutely in favor of character 

2
00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:04,024
education,
but I am slightly worried at the moment 

3
00:00:05,561 --> 00:00:06,394
of some of the some of the noise I'm 
hearing about perhaps grading character 

4
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:10,084
or assessing character and using 
character education as the means of 

5
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:15,760
assessing pupils and most are absolutely
in favor of teaching character.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,803
The measurement of parents when it's in 
its infancy and one of the main 

7
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:20,584
researchers in this field,
Angela Duckworth has said that such 

8
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:26,770
measurements are not ready for any 
serious kind of high stakes to use.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:27,963
If we did end up grading pupils on 
character and using such great for 

10
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:34,000
anything significant,
that I guarantee you that it will become

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:34,923
effectively another middle class ramp 
away for the underachieving children of 

12
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,020
middle class professionals to gain the 
system in their favor.

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,710
If we get rid of tests,
we will inevitably end up depending more

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,603
on assessment which disadvantages the 
already disadvantaged and reinforces 

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,680
prevailing stereotypes.

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,570
Now,
in the not too recent past,

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,690
these patterns were much better 
understood than they are today.

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,763
In the 19th century,
the civil service reform was Charles 

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,133
Northcote and Stafford Trevelyan.
For so long battle to make entry to the 

20
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:03,843
Civil Service based on merit rather than
family connections in the early 20th 

21
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:07,594
century.
Pioneering Labor education is such as 

22
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:10,024
our external who trusts you mentioned 
and Beatrice and Sydney web for an 

23
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,843
education system based around exams.
Rh Tony didn't just believe as truth 

24
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,140
remotely said in the amounts of Patriot 
power of education.

25
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,063
He believed in the emancipator he power 
of exams because he thought the only 

26
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:27,370
exams could ensure that underprivileged 
children were treated fairly.

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,460
Only exams could counter entrenched 
privilege.

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,650
Very little has changed since then.
If anything,

29
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:34,330
we have more research to back up.
Tony's.

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,410
You,
uh,

31
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,660
exams are still the Ferris means of 
assessment.

32
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,140
And if you care about meritocracy,
social mobility and fairness,

33
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,520
then you must be in favor of them.
