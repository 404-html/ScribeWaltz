1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,793
Today in the world,
more people die from eating too much 

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,640
than from eating too little for the 
first time in history.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,743
I think the last data for the World 
Health Organization says that about 3 

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,190
million people die each year from 
obesity and related diseases compared to

5
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:26,191
1 million people that die from 
starvation and malnutrition as a st time

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,490
for the first time in history,
more people dying from old age than from

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,210
infectious diseases and also for the 
first time in history,

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,540
more people commit suicide each year 
that the total number of death from war,

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,100
crime and terrorism put together,
which is very good news.

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,630
I'm
not the suicide bit front that affected.

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,543
Yes,
yes,

12
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,100
it's not.
It's suicides of went up.

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,110
It's the death from violence has gone 
down today.

14
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:04,780
Let's say for the people here in this 
room,

15
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,730
I think it's safe to say that Mcdonald's
and Coca Cola,

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,180
Paul's a far greater threat to your life
than al Qaeda and Islamic state.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,670
The chance that

18
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,823
you,

19
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,853
the chance that you will die from eating
too much at Mcdonald's is about a 

20
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:30,110
thousand times higher,
and this is not an exaggeration.

21
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:30,944
This is statistics,
it's about a thousand times higher than 

22
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:38,630
the chance will be killed by some 
Islamic state terrorism attack.
