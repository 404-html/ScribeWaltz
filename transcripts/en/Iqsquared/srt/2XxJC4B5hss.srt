1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,250
But roughly speaking ever since smog,
it's natural for every two pounds we pay

2
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:06,084
and we get one pound back in.
The one pound we get back is under 

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,893
conditions.
So I think we're going to be stronger 

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,430
because our economy is strong.
If the vote leave,

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,000
I think going to be safer because we've 
got greater control of our borders.

6
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:18,834
Who voted leave and I think we're going 
to be better off and we're going to be 

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,313
better off because the European Union 
was created in a time when big trading 

8
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:28,950
blox existed.
They don't exist anymore.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,340
What we've got now is global trading of 
goods,

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,383
global trading of services,
and we also have global movement of 

11
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:37,914
people.
None of these things the ear is capable 

12
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:43,020
of dealing with.
It has outgrown its time.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,010
I wish the euro countries well,
they need deeper integration.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,413
They need it because I don't want how 
generations of young people to be on a 

15
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:53,580
heap of unemployment.
I wish them well.

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,770
I think we're better off to vote.
Leave.

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,090
If we are strong and they're strong than
the continent of Europe is strong.

18
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,540
If we collectively week that will serve 
no one.

19
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,720
So take control,
vote leave.

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,920
[inaudible].
