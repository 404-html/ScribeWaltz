1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,883
The world is more mobile than ever,
but increased mobility has also brought 

2
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:13,530
congestion,
high emissions and poor air quality with

3
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:16,110
a number of cars on the road set to 
quadruple by.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,973
20 50 mega cities such as Los Angeles in
Sao Paolo or becoming gridlock and road 

5
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:28,230
speeds in London are approximately the 
same as they were a century goal,

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,513
11 miles an hour.
If mobility is to remain the lifeblood 

7
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:37,620
of our economy,
we need smart deliverable solutions.

8
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,823
Car sharing pioneered by organizations 
like Zipcar and buzz car could be one 

9
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:46,434
answer.
Every shared car takes 15 private cars 

10
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:50,814
off the road.
Driverless cars are also gaining 

11
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:57,540
momentum as a safer cleaner and more 
efficient way of getting around.

12
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,160
A recent study has shown that by 
managing their own speed,

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,340
cars increase efficiency by over 40 
percent.

14
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,920
This number rises to 273 percent.
When the cars worked together,

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,593
their sky Tran,
a system of personal jetson's style 

16
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:18,600
transit pods set for a trial run in Tel 
Aviv,

17
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,040
gliding above congested streets at 100 
miles an hour or faster.

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,630
They can achieve the equivalent of over 
200 miles per us gallon.

19
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,780
Not all solutions are high tech shared 
space projects in city centers,

20
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,823
strip away traffic lights along the 
traditional barriers between vehicles 

21
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:42,000
and pedestrians.
The result is increased mobility through

22
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,470
a sense of shared risk.

23
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,600
Shell is working with partners to 
innovate mobility.

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,560
That means moving higher volumes of 
people and goods safely,

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,100
cost effectively,
and with reduced environmental impact.

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,153
The Shell Eco Marathon challenges,
student engineers and scientists from 

27
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:06,030
around the world to design and build 
vehicles to meet this demand.

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,913
The prizes are awarded to the teams that
go the furthest using the least amount 

29
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:14,460
of energy.
Shell's scenarios.

30
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:19,461
Team Examines Tomorrow's problems today.
Their latest set of scenarios shows that

31
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,083
if we build more compact cities,
we could reduce car use by around 2000 

32
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:26,274
vehicle kilometers per person per year,
and that by 2070 the passenger road 

33
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:36,681
market could be nearly oil free.
Smarter Mobility solutions are growing.
