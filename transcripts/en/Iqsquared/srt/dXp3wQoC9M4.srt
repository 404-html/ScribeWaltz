00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,883
The world is more mobile than ever,
but increase mobility has also brought 

2
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:13,530
congestion,
high emissions and poor air quality with

3
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:16,080
a number of cars on the road set to 
quadruple by.

4
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:21,081
2050 mega cities such as Los Angeles in 
Sao Paolo are becoming gridlock and road

5
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:28,260
speeds in London are approximately the 
same as they were a century ago,

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,483
11 miles an hour.
If mobility is to remain the lifeblood 

7
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:37,620
of our economy,
we need smart deliverable solutions.

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,853
Car sharing pioneered by organizations 
like Zipcar and buzz car could be one 

9
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:46,434
answer.
Every shared car takes 15 private cars 

10
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:50,814
off the road.
Driverless cars are also gaining 

11
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:55,410
momentum as a safer,
cleaner,

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,540
and more efficient way of getting 
around.

13
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,130
A recent study has shown that by 
managing their own speed,

14
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,083
cars increase efficiency by over 40% 
this number rises to 273% when the cars 

15
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:12,780
work together,
their sky tram,

16
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,973
a system of personal jetson style 
transit pods set for a trial run in Tel 

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,040
Aviv gliding above congested streets at 
a hundred miles an hour or faster,

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,630
they can achieve the equivalent of over 
200 miles per us gallon.

19
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,780
Not all solutions are high tech shared 
space projects in city centers,

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,793
strip away traffic lights along the 
traditional barriers between vehicles 

21
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:42,000
and pedestrians.
The result is increased mobility through

22
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,500
a sense of shared risk.

23
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,600
Shell is working with partners to 
innovate mobility.

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,560
That means moving higher volumes of 
people and goods safely,

25
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,100
cost effectively and with reduced 
environmental impact.

26
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,163
The Shell Eco Marathon challenges 
student engineers and scientists from 

27
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:06,060
around the world to design and build 
vehicles to meet this demand.

28
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,883
The prizes are awarded to the teams that
go the furthest using the least amount 

29
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:16,221
of energy Shell Scenarios Team Examines 
Tomorrow's problems today.

30
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,440
Their latest set of scenarios shows that
if we build more compact cities,

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,680
we could reduce car use by around 2000 
vehicle kilometers per person per year,

32
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,780
and that by 2070 the passenger rode 
market could be nearly oil-free.

33
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,873
