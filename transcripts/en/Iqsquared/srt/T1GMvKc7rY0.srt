1
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,743
Square,

2
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,223
I think the lesson we can draw from 
Hannah's list of forthcoming debates is 

3
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:21,134
that contentiousness is what sells and 
so I hope that we're going to follow in 

4
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:26,234
the footsteps of Christopher hitchens 
tonight and know who the panel is going 

5
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:29,144
to be.
Very contentious indeed because this is 

6
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:35,810
a debate which could not be more timely.
It was jumped up by intelligence squared

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,673
earlier in the air,
but of course last week saw the launch 

8
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:40,034
of the intergenerational foundation 
which is there to campaign for equality 

9
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:44,804
between generations and their stance is 
basically that indeed the baby boomers 

10
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:49,664
have stared in the family silver,
not to mention taken all the houses and 

11
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:55,580
ought to get out of there as soon as 
possible to make way for the young.

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,010
And it's also notable that the occupy 
London demonstrations are basically,

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,133
although they are partly about class,
they are also very largely about 

14
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,853
generational inequality and we all know 
what the basic framework of this 

15
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:11,630
argument is about.

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,913
It's undoubtedly true that there are a 
great many people from the baby boomer 

17
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:19,280
generation who benefited from every good
thing that life had to offer.

18
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,940
They not only had sex before the age of 
aids,

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,540
but they also got the houses which were 
very cheap.

20
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,613
They got the free university educations 
and they've ended up with a great deal 

21
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:36,380
of wealth in the houses and they're 
expecting fantastic pensions and they're

22
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:37,214
still expecting the young to pay and the
young men are growing up in an entirely 

23
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:40,484
different universe in which it's no 
longer possible for ordinary people to 

24
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:44,024
buy houses in their twenties in which 
they are our new secure jobs with final 

25
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:48,494
salary pensions any longer and in which 
they've been told that they have to pay 

26
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:53,770
many thousands of pounds,
but their university educations.

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,993
So some people,
it seems on the face of it completely 

28
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:59,750
obvious that this is unfair and that 
something has to be done.

29
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,303
Now,
we've got a very distinguished panel 

30
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:03,584
here tonight,
but just before I introduced them all 

31
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:06,680
and I just want to remind you or how the
debate operates.

32
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:07,514
You will have voted before you came in 
to the hole and when all the speeches 

33
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:14,060
have been made and the questions from 
the floor have been heard,

34
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,253
then the panel are going to make some 
closing speeches and while they do say 

35
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:18,314
we would like you to vote,
and what was fascinating about these 

36
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:24,380
debates to see whether at all the 
panelists managed to change your mind.

37
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,903
So while that's going on,
can you post in the box which will be 

38
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:31,130
coming round?
Either tear,

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,353
tear this apart and post either you're 
for or against card into the box or if 

40
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:36,584
you're undecided,
post the entire thing and if anyone 

41
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:41,870
would like to tweet about this one,
it's going on.

42
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,930
Then the tweet Hashtag is Iq to silver 
and we'd be glad you did.

43
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,050
Now I've handled tonight is David 
Willetts,

44
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:55,930
the minister of state for universities 
in science and he wrote a very forced,

45
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,470
a book full of foresight and insight so 
called of pinch.

46
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,304
How the baby boomers took their 
children's future and why they should 

47
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,914
give it back.
And as we were debating just before we 

48
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:05,824
came on stage.
It's fascinating that the man who wrote 

49
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:11,230
such a book should now be in a position 
to interrogate the university's minister

50
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,530
about why he is so raised tuition fees 
against the motion.

51
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,170
We're going to have Ed Halco who was 
associate editor of the spectator,

52
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,290
and it's quite curious that he is 
against the motion because he too is the

53
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,560
author of a book on this problem called 
jilted generation.

54
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,394
How Britain bankrupted it's youth.
Then speaking with David for the motion 

55
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:34,660
is Laurie Penny,
spokesman for the younger generation and

56
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,740
journalist for the Guardian and the New 
Statesman and against the motion.

57
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,890
We have frank for Rady,
professor of sociology at the University

58
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,723
of Kent and his books.
His many books include paranoid 

59
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:45,184
parenting.
