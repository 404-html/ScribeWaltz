Mr Holocaust is a political prisoner.
He is in prison as a result of it.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,430
Political conflict.
Why I punted,

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,340
that's 30 seconds of my time on the 1993
events.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,283
It's because they relevant to this day.
That is a political conflict about the 

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,270
only choice available for posts.
Their societies.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,290
Either they are going to be strong,
quite authoritarian states,

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,483
societies that have been killed.
You destroyed about the Soviet system 

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,513
with no separate institutions,
checks and balances or they will be 

10
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:40,070
privatized.
They will be taken over.

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,203
Then we'll become oligarchs systems.
This is what we saw in Russia in the 

12
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,580
late 1990s.
Mr Berry's Husky was an actor,

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,980
uh,
in that process and to that extent we're

14
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:51,860
privileged to have him with us today.
Don't be naive.

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,110
This is the system which had a costco 
wants to bring back.

16
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,540
Was there some other process at work 
that created these immensely wealthy and

17
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:02,410
not just wealthy but incredibly powerful
families?

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,930
No.
As I understand it,

19
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:05,823
Mr. Pin sharp got a lot of his money 
because he was the beneficiary of state 

20
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:11,290
sells off of,
of assets.

21
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,243
When Leo needs to put Shamar was 
precedent and there is something 

22
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:15,814
remarkable.
There is something to me utterly 

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,110
remarkable about his wife,
Iliana friendship,

24
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:23,944
describing herself as a philanthropist 
because she gives some money to aids 

25
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,380
when so much money has been got by that 
family from the Ukraine.

26
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:33,214
It is a little bit like somebody 
stealing your wallet and everything in 

27
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:40,510
it and then giving you $10 back and 
saying,

28
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,620
I'm a philanthropist.

29
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:45,510
For

30
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,343
sure.
I would like to stress the most 

31
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:51,504
transparent and the most powerful 
Russian company today he caught and 

32
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,293
other who presented this company in Jay.
And it's very important to understand 

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,190
that the west,
except the rules for that Kowski because

34
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,024
the world of Ucas company at the best 
celebrities of their Western Wall quit 

35
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,053
quick set.
He's conception call except the 

36
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:16,740
company's transparent and put your 
destroyed it completely.
