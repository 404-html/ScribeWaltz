1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,080
[inaudible]

2
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,640
game.
It's not just a debate.

3
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,640
It's an occupied spirit that cannot be 
stopped as the former attorney general,

4
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,160
a prosecutor,
the governor of that state,

5
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,320
and not only accept your child,
you are dead wrong,

6
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:47,190
sir.
We cannot talk.

7
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,470
Know this is not 1989 anymore.
I wonder whether when they say,

8
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:58,010
I'll pray for you,
he gets that wonderful reply.

9
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,960
I'll think for you on the unselfish or 
wearing a redundant,

10
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,143
I won't say it's too easy to say,
better late than never here I've said 

11
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:06,974
it.
A lot of people in this world are 

12
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:13,610
looking for an alternative approach.
We never dropped the bomb.

13
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:15,620
We never launched a missile.
We never fired a bullet.

14
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,910
I doubt very much whether they will be 
genuine,

15
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,100
one man,
one vote,

16
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,870
but I would be delighted to be proven if
we mess up this one.

17
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,040
There's no other ones.
What done for

18
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,770
the war on terror was the right response
to nine 11 but we need to refinance,

19
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,900
not just have bankers.
Mintos think the whole of our society,

20
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,320
of course,
hip hop pomp enhanced the society.

21
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,680
We should be calling an end to the war 
on drugs.

22
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,030
Barack Obama is ultimately an American 
patriot.

23
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,900
The Catholic church is a force for good 
in the world.

24
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,763
Are you getting the message?
There is a reason we hammer home these 

25
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,750
use because they matter.
