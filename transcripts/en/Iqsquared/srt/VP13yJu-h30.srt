Welcome to today's hot topic from 
intelligence squared.com too much free 

2
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:06,494
speech kills the massacre in Arizona 
shows that the USA must learn from 

3
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:13,490
Europe to curb hate speech.
Do you agree?

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,020
The Lone gunman who mowed down Gabrielle
giffords was mentally disturbed,

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,273
but where the outcomes of his ravings 
caused by the climate of political 

6
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:23,920
hostility.
Sarah Pailin,

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,170
for example,
had placed gunsight icons on giffords.

8
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:28,004
Congressional district.
Does this mean she shares and the 

9
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:33,010
responsibility for what happened in 
Britain?

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,873
Politician filled Willis was stripped of
his seat and his party membership for 

11
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,374
the kind of polarizing language.
That's an everyday occurrence in the 

12
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:43,750
USA.
So who has got it right?

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,003
Does liberal democracy need you to get a
thick skin or does it need a strong 

14
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:51,280
state protecting us from extreme verbal 
assault?

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,353
Here are some highlights from Wendy 
kaminer confronting femi ought to Taji 

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,433
as they thrash it out.
We start with femi defending curbs on 

17
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:00,034
hate speech.

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,870
Less hate speech will be bread and so we
would have less to fear.

19
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,303
I hate speech can certainly be a 
contributing factor to bigotry and 

20
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:16,540
prejudice.
And I'm,

21
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,650
you know,
I'm not a,

22
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,750
I'm not here defending the merits of 
hate speech,

23
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,700
but I,
I,

24
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:23,750
you know,
as I said,

25
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,610
I think it is always much more dangerous
and I also think that it's morally wrong

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,073
to criminalize speech that we don't like
because we have some sense that in the 

27
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,410
long run it's,
it's going to be,

28
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:40,244
it's going to cause decide or harm.
English should be given the right to 

29
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:47,750
speak yes to the point where it violates
the rights of others.

30
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,230
People may be given the right to express
their concerns about principles,

31
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,520
but not about individual characteristics
of people.

32
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,483
I personally am grateful and proud to 
live in a country and to be part of a 

33
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:04,214
nation that does not tolerate hate.
Speech is anything I'd say that perhaps 

34
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:10,394
our restrictions and keeps me in the UK.
I've go far enough if I can take this 

35
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,320
opportunity to respond quickly to some 
of the things that family said first.

36
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:18,154
I,
I really appreciate her forthrightness 

37
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,900
in questioning why we need to have 
freedom of speech,

38
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:28,090
because that's not a statement that you 
will generally hear from people in the u

39
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:31,970
s to defend hate speech regulation.
Because here,

40
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,940
um,
it's not really so acceptable to say,

41
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:36,740
I don't believe in free speech.
