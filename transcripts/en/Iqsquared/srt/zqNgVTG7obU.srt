1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,781
The,
the,

2
00:00:00,781 --> 00:00:02,120
the argument that,
uh,

3
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,180
I think,
uh,

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,270
taking on cuttings because last point 
about when countries become independent,

5
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:11,410
I think this is something that a Russian
politicians says,

6
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,010
Oregon complaining about saying that,
oh,

7
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:13,844
this is the walls was a bloke mentality.
Those people hate us and they actually 

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,493
created more problems in a relationship 
with Europe because they became 

9
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:24,164
independent and they're trying to play 
their own political games and gaming 

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,183
internationalism.
I think that a lot of that will depend 

11
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:36,911
on whether they will actually shale gas 
development in the foreseeable future in

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,743
those countries that you mentioned 
because I think that Russians really 

13
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:45,800
have the capacity to act quite quickly.
And as I said earlier,

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,963
there is a lot of pressure now.
I'm particularly from a company such as 

15
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:54,370
Nova Tech,
but also from the Russian oil,

16
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,730
oil companies,
particular Rosneft to um,

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,090
which is moving into gas business very 
actively,

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,493
very actively.
And they could potentially displace 

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,780
Gazprom to a certain degree.
It was in Russia and also externally.

20
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,423
So,
um,

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,080
I don't know.
I think that,

22
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:15,914
um,
it's often difficult to make 

23
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:21,380
predictions.
Your question is it related to 10 years,

24
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,970
20 years,
30 years,

25
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:23,804
40 years,
but when we look at this aspect to 

26
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,250
remember about all this forecast,
what we're talking about,

27
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,110
if you look at the,

28
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,910
the latest they're talking about 20,
35,

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,720
$24.
So by looking but you know,

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,440
20,
30 years ahead,

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,670
look at what we're now in year 19,
20,

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,020
20 slash 30 years.
What has happened in the world.

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,573
So I think this is,
this is an important point that the 

34
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:55,630
world is changing and a very fast pace 
and I think that a lot of this,

35
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,660
a lot of this,
a forecast and predictions are just,

36
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,700
I'm just a guide for us to
base our decisions.
