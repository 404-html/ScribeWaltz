1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,890
Technology gives us the ability to 
create relationships in the supply chain

2
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:04,724
relationships between producers and 
consumers much more flexibly and 

3
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:08,624
rapidly.
We're seeing it already in food 

4
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:10,784
production,
in transport resources such as journeys 

5
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:15,680
in cars and parking spaces.
Um,

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,490
and we're seeing it in the,
in the manufacturer of custom goods.

7
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:20,324
So the image on the bottom left is taken
from shapeways where you can three d 

8
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:24,614
print pretty much anything that you like
and the cost of this technology is 

9
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:28,650
coming down.
Um,

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,153
okay.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,430
At the same time,
these marketplaces are transactional and

12
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:34,264
we've got interesting opportunities to 
affect the rate of exchange used in 

13
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:40,710
those transactions.
There's a,

14
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:41,544
an alternative currency that's been in 
use in Switzerland for nearly a hundred 

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,333
years now.
The where that starts to have 

16
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:46,864
contributed to economic stability.
Though I suspect with someone from the 

17
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:52,600
lse chairing the debate,
we may have a comment on that.

18
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,803
Um,
five towns of cities in the UK have 

19
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:57,574
their own local currencies now with 
similar intentions and they're 

20
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:03,244
increasingly using advanced technology 
to support those currencies such as the 

21
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:10,180
droplet smartphone payment system that's
being created in,

22
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,023
in Birmingham.
These rates of exchange offers the 

23
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,800
possibility to compare the complete cost
of goods and services,

24
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:18,634
the financial costs and their social and
environmental implications with dynamic 

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,673
low,
highly localized value to the 

26
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:25,624
participants.
What it's worth to me now to have this 

27
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:32,200
service rather than what it might be 
worth to me to have it in two weeks time

28
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:33,100
when I really need it.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,630
Okay.

30
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,463
I think there's tremendous potential 
here to produce new information based 

31
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:41,980
marketplaces that could support more 
sustainable city systems,

32
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,113
but if there such a good idea,
why don't we have them do ubiquitously 

33
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,083
already.

34
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,100
Okay.

35
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,430
And that comes down to something that's 
been mentioned by the other by the other

36
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:54,910
speakers were cities are making progress
on this agenda.

37
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,773
It's where the coordinating the use of 
their public sector and private sector 

38
00:01:59,111 --> 00:01:59,944
assets towards a cocreated division 
towards a common set of goals and 

39
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:03,874
objectives.
But in order to win that level of 

40
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:06,754
commitment,
you don't only need the buy in of the 

41
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:12,430
leaders and managers of those resources.
You need the understanding of all of the

42
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:15,520
stakeholders that they are accountable 
to their employees,

43
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,410
the electorate,
their shareholders.

44
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,340
To appeal to that tremendously broad set
of interests.

45
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,121
We need to,
I think,

46
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:24,520
to appeal to some common instincts 
amongst us,

47
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:25,354
all a sense of narrative and our ability
to empathize rather than focus on the 

48
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:32,320
financial efficiencies created by smart 
infrastructures.

49
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:33,154
And if we do that,
we may not get very far because smart 

50
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:35,944
ideas cut across silos.
So those who realize the benefits may 

51
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:41,560
not be those who are asked to make the 
investment in the first case.

52
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,270
And instead we should be concentrating 
on the social and personal and community

53
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:48,430
value that can be created when people 
can,

54
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,293
and I can afford to buy better food 
where they could afford to heat their 

55
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:55,930
homes properly in winter when they have 
access to affordable transport to places

56
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:56,910
of employment.
