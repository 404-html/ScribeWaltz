1
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,743
Squared,

2
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,023
the best hope for modernization and 
ultimately liberalization in the Arab 

3
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:26,264
and Muslim worlds today lies in 
incumbent regimes who recognize that 

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,833
first of all,
economic modernization is essential to 

5
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:36,320
their country's future.

6
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,523
How do groups like Al Qaeda operate?
It should be clear by now that in 

7
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:41,484
parasitic fashion,
these groups feed off of host nations 

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,333
that are weak.
It is the relief from the life in 

9
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:51,100
purgatory that constitutes the average 
lot of the average Arab,

10
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,470
that life is about unemployment.
Real rates of up to 35 and 40 percent,

11
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,603
and young men who when polled 
consistently complained that their 

12
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:02,500
existence offers no hope and no 
opportunity.

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,103
It is about the fact that the United 
Nations Development Program estimate 

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,940
that nine percent of every business deal
in the Middle East Coast for bribes,

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,480
and when students who want to vote step 
into the streets of Cairo,

16
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,810
they risk arrest and torture like Karim 
Solomon,

17
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,763
who was sodomized,
tortured because he demonstrated in 

18
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:20,824
favor of the rule of law.
These victims of Middle Eastern 

19
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,373
depression are the ones who provide the 
oxygen that enables al Qaeda to operate 

20
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,730
and it gives resonance to their 
political messages.
