1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
Um,
what I'm going to do is try to dispel 

2
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:05,790
some of the methods of art room.
We're not going to have the Romans in my

3
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:08,900
talk is a load of storm troopers.
You know,

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,520
bashing our innocent little goals with 
their magic potion.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,690
We get to see the Romans as a 
transformative power of civilization.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,940
Nastier,
no way.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,810
But everybody in the ancient world is 
horrible and brutal in our turns.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,470
Even those lovely Athenians that Boris 
so likes.
