1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,453
The problem we have is that the damage 
we coast to the global environment is 

2
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:10,850
not reflected in the price of the energy
we consume.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,863
Right?
That's the most basic definition of the 

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,960
problem.
We,

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,230
we,
we have.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,890
If you bring even partly the,
the,

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,113
the cost,
the what we call the external cost of 

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,400
your fuel consumption into the price of 
energy you raised,

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,880
your price is a bit higher or much 
higher if you do it.

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,050
If you do it a meaningful.
There's no way around that.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,913
Yes.
Addressing climate change is all about 

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,843
changing the relative prices of energy 
to make the carbon intensive ones 

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,783
relatedley more expensive and the carbon
less intensive one relatively less 

14
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:50,594
expensive.

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,853
Actually.
It's all about what the public will 

16
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:56,150
believe and what they will take in the 
way of messaging.

17
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,730
Whatever they want.
A ton of ton of a democracy.

18
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:02,600
It actually matters.

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,131
Well,
they did.

20
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:06,390
That wasn't.
That wasn't the point that we are.

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,390
It was Mike,
Mike Stevens,

22
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:09,670
who pointed out that it was a real 
problem with the public

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,503
believed and what the power of those who
have got all authority of the eloquence 

24
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:15,694
in order to convey the right message.
The saving the world message of alcohol 

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,820
was absolutely hopeless.
It is not convincing anybody at all.
