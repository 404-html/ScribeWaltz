1
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,530
Regarding intervention or the West 
should do.

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,180
I think,
yes,

3
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:12,014
I'm in an ideal situation.
I would agree that a humanitarian corey 

4
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:16,310
doors,
safe zones,

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,300
uh,
you name it,

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,950
no fly zones,
brilliant,

7
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:19,784
but it's never going to happen and it's 
never going to happen because I think 

8
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:24,960
the United States,
uh,

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,290
has reached the conclusion that a choice
to topple Michelle said,

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,010
then let's be quite clear.
I mean,

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,530
if the United States,
NATO gets involved,

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,450
I think the regime will crumble very 
quickly,

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,793
but a quick crumbling of the regime or 
the collapse of the regime will 

14
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,664
inevitably lead to a prolonged the 
Lebanon style civil war because 

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,460
potentially the partition of Syria and 
this is a very real prospect by the way.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,833
So should we interpret you saying that 
as meaning that your urging us to be 

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,420
careful what we wish for.
In a way,

18
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:59,550
you're saying that if the,
if the regime collapses,

19
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:00,690
it's not wholly a good thing.

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,733
Well to be a realistic,
even in regime collapse a look that the 

21
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,250
region probably has probably about 2 
million hardcore supporters.

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,380
And again,
I'm being very realistic and very honest

23
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:11,350
with you.
There are,

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,193
Jim does have those people and those,
I mean Gaddafi didn't have 2 million 

25
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:17,190
people,
a hardcore sport is not robotic,

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,083
but by Sharon does and that's the 
primary reason why he's still in power 

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,700
and those 2 million people are simply 
going to go away.

28
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,190
They're going to stay in Syria,
they probably going to fight,

29
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,273
they're going to reinforce their own 
areas and they're probably going to 

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,450
fight against the central government.
Whoever takes control in Damascus.

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,940
So you know,
we have to be realistic about this.

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,010
What can be done immediately.
I think the West can perhaps through the

33
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:45,030
Qataris and the Saudis for instance,
they can support local military councils

34
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:45,864
and they are being set up to organize 
the free Syrian army on a local level 

35
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,060
and they can spot those people.

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,070
Problem is the Jordanians and the Turks 
won't allow a arms in,

37
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,110
don't even allow humanitarian aid 
through their border.

38
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,670
Um,
so this is a big,

39
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,860
big logistical problem.
You can,

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,380
you can pay FSA,
fight salaries,

41
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,250
but I mean,
I don't say,

42
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,370
I don't see how that,
that,

43
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,880
that's going to help you need weapons.
So particular type of.

44
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,230
Okay,
we're good.

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,540
Come to the JC,
your,

46
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,423
your,
the proposal you would support is the 

47
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:17,030
same as Roger Korean's arming the 
opposition?

48
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:17,864
Yeah,
I mean look,

49
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,733
as long as she believes that he can win 
militarily and at the moment he does 

50
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:26,630
believe he can win militarily,
then there will be no political solution

51
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:28,850
and ultimately there has to be a 
political solution.

52
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,020
There can be no,
no other,

53
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,480
no other solution.
So it's about forcing by.

54
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,410
Charlotte said to sit on the negotiating
table and he'll only do that if he faces

55
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:37,244
and armed opposition that could 
seriously fight him at least to a 

56
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:40,940
stalemate.
Absolutely.
