1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
What we're seeing.
What I'm saying at least is that there 

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:04,164
should be an evolutionary process to 
democracy as there was in Hong Kong and 

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,710
you mentioned that in the year 2017 Hong
Kong will have universal suffered.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,200
I think that remains very much to be 
seen.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,410
I doubt very much whether they will be 
genuine and one man,

6
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:20,244
one vote,
but I would be delighted to be proven 

7
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:23,740
wrong.
Okay.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,773
Can I answer that question?
I think it depends on what you mean by 

9
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:27,804
democracy.
I don't think democracy centers just on 

10
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:33,120
one man,
one vote.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,330
I'm willing to concede that at this 
stage,

12
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:38,700
maybe one man,
one vote is a little too early,

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:39,743
but there are the other aspects of 
democracy which I believe to be 

14
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:47,481
important for all nation and for all 
human beings and that is human dignity,

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,303
some basic rights and freedoms.
The right to participate in the 

16
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:57,240
governance,
to improve the quality of governance,

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,080
to have some say in issues that affect 
their everyday life,

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,050
to have the rule of law,
not the role of men,

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,943
not rule by law,
and to have an independent judiciary 

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,310
that is not subject to the dictates of 
the one party system rule.

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,600
Now,
I agree with Martin that in the three 30

22
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:20,601
years since opened our policy that has 
been phenomenal economic growth that has

23
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,630
been a degree of personal freedom and 
social mobility.

24
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,823
But the sad fact is that in recent years
market economy reforms have stalled and 

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,150
the government has backtracked on legal 
reforms.

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,720
All judicial organs in China are now 
subject to the dictates of the one party

27
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:43,554
system rule.
Do we seriously thing that the 

28
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:50,190
population that the 1.3 billion people 
in mainland China,

29
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:51,024
I contend to accept this.
You say that there are mass support for 

30
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,014
the one party system role.
Why is it then that we get people in 

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,710
from mainland coming to Hong Kong to 
participate in demonstration,

32
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,693
particularly against the blind dissident
and the young young who was alleged to 

33
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:08,940
have committed suicide

34
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,970
[inaudible].
