1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,890
Impartiality,
I think the question and those precisely

2
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:05,840
what it costs,
he knows exactly what it is.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,040
Um,
it's,

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:07,903
what he's getting at is this notion that
the opposite is festering away in his 

5
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:15,030
mind that the BBC is partial.
Uh,

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,970
first of all,
the BBC is not monolithic,

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,070
so therefore it is not partial that are 
those people who work for,

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,020
to take one of you that are those people
who worked with you take another view.

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,580
Um,
but you asked you,

10
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:26,414
you've made it rather more personal than
that than you asked me about my 

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,480
impartiality.
All I can tell you sir,

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,403
is that I've been doing this job on the 
Today program for 27 years and I have 

13
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:41,360
been accused,
but all of them

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,783
being unfair to all of them.
And I hope that continues because I 

15
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:50,310
mean,
I know it's,

16
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:50,721
it's,
it's,

17
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:51,554
it's,
it's a rather crude and clumsy way of 

18
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:54,470
measuring impartiality,
isn't it?

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,280
But,
uh,

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,510
but I reckon,
you know,

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,150
if,
if,

22
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,983
um,
one moment you're being a attacked by 

23
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:02,054
the Labor Party,
by the Conservative Party to other 

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,040
poisoning the well,
the democratic debate,

25
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,950
which is what a certain Jonathan Econ 
who subsequently went to jail,

26
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:14,951
but we'll put that to one side,
said it said about me and uh,

27
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:16,700
and then,
uh,

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,540
and then praise by the third party 
simultaneously,

29
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,460
simultaneously for saving democracy on 
behalf of the great relationship.

30
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:24,294
Then when the Labor party came to power,
all of a sudden you find that actually 

31
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,313
as they said and left the BBC,
something must be done about the John 

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,991
Humphrey's problem.
I mean,

33
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:31,370
you know,
that's the way it's,

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,490
it's politics for God's sake and you 
should be able to enough and ugly enough

35
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:35,324
to know that.
And I would ask as for whether it's the 

36
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:39,540
fault of the BBC or not.
And uh,

37
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,230
obviously you think it is the fault with
BBC,

38
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,930
whatever the full happens to be.
All I was held entirely serious here.

39
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,710
I put aside what the Today program does.
Some people like it,

40
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:49,544
some don't.
The BBC is ibelieve immensely important 

41
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,143
to this country.
I struggled to imagine this country 

42
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,330
without the BBC for all it.
Many,

43
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,410
many,
many folds.

44
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,400
I think it's a great civilizing.
It's tuition and I hope it survives.

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Thank you.
