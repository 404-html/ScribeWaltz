1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,040
Just let me say a few of the key 
messages,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:02,933
I mean other people think that you still
have to wait for new brakes with 

3
00:00:04,941 --> 00:00:06,960
technology and I don't think that's the 
case.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,823
We have to existing technologies,
but they have to break through and that 

5
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:15,870
doesn't come by itself and uncle venture
gas and America wasn't a big surprise to

6
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:16,704
everyone say in the last decade,
but the first pioneers were already out 

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,760
there trying to develop the technology 
in the eighties.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,013
So it takes a few decades,
about three decades for new technology 

9
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:31,280
to really come through.
And that's a very normal timespan,

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,950
uh,
in the energy industry,

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,793
this industry to actually have new 
technologies coming on stream to about 

12
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,004
one percent market share when it 
actually becomes competitive with 

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:41,883
existing incumbents.
So bear that in mind three decades 

14
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:48,180
before it becomes competitive,
another three decades before it actually

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,100
reaches and notch natural market share.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,160
So it's really Internet 
intergenerational game.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,640
Then the other aspect is something about
efficiency.

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,330
A lot of policy is based on the 
efficiency that we're going to improve.

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,110
Saudi has something built in around 15 
percent of the next 25 years.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,410
But efficiency doesn't come by itself,
it has his own dilemmas,

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,293
policy dilemmas,
because you know who's going to pay for 

22
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:12,954
it.
Because if an end consumer not have the 

23
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:18,120
expectation that end consumer price will
continuously rise,

24
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:18,983
why would you invest now upfront a lot 
of money to invest in efficiency while 

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,593
governments normally liked to say that 
energy should be more affordable and 

26
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,540
cheaper every day,
and here's kind of dichotomy to breach.

27
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,460
Another critical technology which we 
have to really come to grips with.

28
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,313
Zoom is carbon capture and sequestration
CCS really to decarbonize the power 

29
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,124
system.
I'm afraid if you want a lower carbon 

30
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:46,530
system,
you can't do without a technological fix

31
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:48,390
called carbon capture and sequestration.
