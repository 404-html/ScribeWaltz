1
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,983
We got to discuss the debate in the old 
fashioned one against that will be time 

2
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,990
for you to ask questions to the panel
of the motion.

3
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,083
So the motion tonight is whether or not 
the market is the best judge of good 

4
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,300
art.
Now being an awkward,

5
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,623
I would say that I was.
I think we should find out what is art 

6
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,783
market fellows now.
He sounds rather he supposedly worth 

7
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:57,910
about 6 billion euros in the UK sales 
alone every year,

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,560
although I don't know how much tax he 
pays on that.

9
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,363
We have at least 10 outfits and the next
two weeks to thank for them as well as 

10
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:06,514
the options.
There was a grumpy fellow audrick to 

11
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:13,870
this week who claimed that it was absurd
in the middle of the banking crisis.

12
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,530
His paintings might sell for anywhere 
between two and 9 million pounds,

13
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,083
but let's not forget where we are in the
house of one of this country's most 

14
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:25,570
influential art collectors and taste 
makers,

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,450
inventors,
et Cetera.

16
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,170
So part of the question is,
does the money work of our commands make

17
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:37,960
it better?
So to help us answer this question,

18
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:42,580
we have a very distinguished panel,
but I'd like to find out from you,

19
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,650
first of all,
before we get going,

20
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,783
quick show of hands,
who thinks that is the best judge of 

21
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:52,360
good things?
Put your hands up now on two,

22
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:53,194
three,
four?

23
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,183
Yes.
Okay.

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,930
And who wouldn't?
Who wouldn't agree?

25
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,830
Come on.
Tell.

26
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,780
Satya said,
could you leave the building

27
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:14,170
and I think in order to try and convince
you otherwise,

28
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:15,004
we have a very esteemed.
I'd like to invite the first speaker up 

29
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:19,294
please.
