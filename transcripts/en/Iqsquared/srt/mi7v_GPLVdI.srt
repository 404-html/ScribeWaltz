00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,423
So I'm going to leave you with a few 
very simple prescriptions in terms of 

2
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:06,684
what what we can do so we can stop 
talking about mothers and start talking 

3
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:16,770
about parents every time you want to say
mother,

4
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:19,680
stop.
Say parents and children,

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,173
parents and family stopped talking about
daughters and start talking about 

6
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:28,800
caregivers are in Britain,
carers,

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,233
carers for parents,
whether their sons or daughters stopped 

8
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:39,561
talking about fathers and start talking 
about earners or providers.

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,460
Both men and women
start assuming that every everybody,

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,633
men and women want some combination of 
the ability to invest in themselves and 

11
00:00:55,681 --> 00:01:00,150
to invest in others,
everyone and that all workers,

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,313
all employees will have caregiving 
responsibilities at some point in their 

13
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:10,140
lives and a competitive effective 
workplace.

14
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,063
Efficient,
productive will make room for that kind 

15
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,783
of care and start assuming that 
investing in others is every bit as 

16
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:26,190
important and rewarding and valuable as 
investing in ourselves.

17
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,500
And finally,
I don't think I would call it equalism.

18
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:36,120
I think a Galitary aneurysm is better,
but maybe isms are not the way to go.

19
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,543
What we are looking for is a world in 
which we don't assume everyone is the 

20
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,020
same,
absolutely not,

21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,333
but a world in which our assumptions 
about who someone is and what they want 

22
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,690
and what they can achieve and what their
potential is is not tied to their sex or

23
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:07,251
their gender or their sexual orientation
any more than it is tied to the shape of

24
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:12,210
their features or the color of their 
skin.

25
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,750
Thank you.
