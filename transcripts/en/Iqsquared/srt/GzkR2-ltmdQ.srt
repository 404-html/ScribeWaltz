1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,610
When raw,
they rose to fight aids.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,473
The foes we sprang to work and will,
when Laurie gave to drake the wave she 

3
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:16,934
gave to us the hill,
this is the hill on which Harris 

4
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:23,720
standards so they could look down on the
people below.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,030
In every sense.
Looking back on it,

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,903
I sometimes feel that the only one of my
contemporaries at school who hasn't yet 

7
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:29,864
been to jail is mark Faccia and it's not
for want of trying the Stanford 

8
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,643
Education.
So many of our schools is so poor that 

9
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:43,301
if you happen to go to a good one,
your privileged and at the heart of this

10
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:46,130
debate is the question,
is privilege a bad thing?

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,263
Is it a bad thing?
What about if that privilege has been 

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,610
ernt?
What about if that privilege meet simply

13
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:55,700
means going to a better school than 
average?

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,060
And what about if the word that is being
used as privileged,

15
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,000
when what we really mean is successful?

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,103
Of all those brilliant,
brilliantly educated young people honed 

17
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:09,460
to perfection in the white heat of this 
crucible of excellence,

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,700
who's bought education buys them the 
best jobs in those monuments to selfless

19
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,380
wisdom.
The media,

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,150
law and banking.

21
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,623
I happen to think that a society in 
which nobody has access in the original 

22
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:29,860
language to homer,
Virgil,

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,300
you repertories or Ovid is a grossly 
impoverished society.

24
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,640
I can't help thinking that if lady died,
been encouraged to get a few more gcse,

25
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,100
yes,
she would have done better in life.

26
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,810
Between the years 2003 and 2008 private 
school fees went up by 43%.

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,100
The Independent Schools Council when 
asked about their said,

28
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,611
ah,
well,

29
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:56,550
you see it's education,
inflation,

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,620
education,
inflation,

31
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:01,320
what's there?
Was it the price of shore could suddenly

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,830
gone hugely are uh,
whatever it is they make.

33
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:05,664
Board dusters was running out in the 
world and could only be kind of 

34
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:10,590
purchased with gold.
All I do

35
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,700
is the Oracle gentleman on that side of 
the house,

36
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,710
Uzi to such media chat shows and the 
columns of the establishment organs,

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,250
which they write and draw and I 
relapsed.

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,960
I accused them of being on chair.
Revolutionary is and Nuke Sop Marxists.
