1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,770
I had a friend in Albany and she called 
me.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,500
She said,
Robert Moses was up here yesterday and I

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:08,334
think you should come back,
and I remember driving up to Albany and 

4
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:12,294
walking into the press gallery of the 
assembly just as they approved the 

5
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:20,070
bridge by a vote of something like 183 
to four,

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,503
and I remember thinking in that moment 
everything I've been writing has sorta 

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,860
been baloney because whether you say it 
or not in an article,

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,320
everything I was doing was based on the 
feeling that ended democracy.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,620
Political power comes from the ballot 
box from being elected from the people.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,993
Yet here was a man who was never elected
to anything and enough power to turn in 

11
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,114
an entire state government around in a 
single day and I had no idea and 

12
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,040
actually neither did anybody else where 
he got this power from.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,593
And it was then that.
I thought that if I really wanted to 

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,410
write about politics,
truthfully I have to find out because no

15
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:14,790
one knew where he got his power and how 
we had been using it for so long.
