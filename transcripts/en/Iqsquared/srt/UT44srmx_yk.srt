1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
I don't think for a second the Kissinger
would support a British exit from the 

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,180
European Union,
nor would I,

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,040
but the reason why he would be skeptical
about it,

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:14,874
it's probably rather different from the 
typical reasons that are put forward 

5
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:22,500
these days in the debate because it's 
not really about economics,

6
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:23,334
which is conventionally how we tend to 
debate these things are the argument 

7
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:27,054
here is a strategic one.
Britain is still one of the world's 

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,680
powers,
maybe not a great part,

9
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:34,514
but still a significant power,
but the European Union allows it to 

10
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:38,484
magnify its power and this is something 
that I think is an undeniable fact and 

11
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:46,470
without it,
I think Britain would be much diminished

12
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:51,471
in the realm of foreign policy.
If you want to understand what it's like

13
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:52,614
to be a European country outside the EU,
take a trip to Switzerland and ask them 

14
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:01,170
how it's going to be part of Europe,
but have no vote.

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,600
Have no say so.
I think you know,

16
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:04,434
my own sense is,
although I'm not trying to second guess 

17
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:07,614
him,
that world order strongly implies a 

18
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:13,530
British membership of the EU.
Remember,

19
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,980
there's an angler file strand to 
Kissinger.

20
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,490
He had from an early age and early 
stage,

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,353
very good friends in this country 
ranging across the political spectrum 

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,080
from the great historian Michael Howard,
to Dennis Ed.

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,340
When he came to Europe.
Kissinger really meant he came to France

24
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:36,750
to Germany and to Great Britain.
He spent relatively little time in other

25
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:39,390
countries except occasional trips to 
Italy,

26
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,853
but his view of Europe I think was one 
that combined and understanding of the 

27
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:48,970
need for Britain to be engaged with 
Europe and and understanding that Europe

28
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,110
security was very much a factor for 
NATO.

29
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,810
So my sense is that the whole argument 
of the most recent book he wrote,

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,820
World Order is that Europe is itself a 
power,

31
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:04,320
but it's a power that must reform 
itself.

32
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,730
It's a power that risks impotence 
through its own internal entanglements,

33
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:14,520
its own internal internal complexities 
and the whole point.

34
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:15,354
I think if the government strategies is 
to argue for reform of Europe rather 

35
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:20,430
than than for exit from it.
