1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,000
In the United States,
for example,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,870
if we take census numbers and if we 
assume that the homes,

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,733
the households in the US are going to 
become a little smaller such as Germany 

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,613
today,
the United States will have to build 74 

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,490
million new homes or the next 40 years,
74 million.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,420
This is more than the United Kingdom.
France,

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,463
Canada,
and Australia put together has today in 

8
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:29,240
pencil halls.
This is not China,

9
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:30,074
this is the United States,
but now the question is how out of the 

10
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:35,314
city going to grow?
Everybody agrees today that low density 

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,043
suburbs,
which is the characteristic urban net 

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,863
structure,
the United States is not convenient for 

13
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:48,320
quality of life,
our environment,

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,040
but also most Americans don't want to 
live in Manhattan either.

15
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:55,274
They don't want to live in high rises,
facing a narrow sidewalk on a street 

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,893
full of cars,
which is dangerous where people may get 

17
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:06,950
killed,
which is noisy.

18
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,263
So the question is we need to build 74 
million new homes in the United States 

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,133
and whatever it is done in the United 
States would have a huge influence in 

20
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:19,250
the rest of the world.

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,980
How are they see this going to be 
billed,

22
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,180
so why not think of an American new 
American safety with which is dense with

23
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,363
thousands of miles of greenways and 
pedestrian only wrote criss crossing in 

24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,193
a city which would be offer density with
offering the same things that people 

25
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,543
seek in the suburbs such as green and 
safe spaces for children to ride 

26
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,524
bicycles.
I radically different design because 

27
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:56,141
clearly we are talking about technology.
What do we have in suburbs or downtown?

28
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,583
Neither one of those works,
so we clearly need to think about 

29
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,280
different urban model,
but the second question is not only how,

30
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,440
but where are they see this going to be 
up in the United States.

31
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:15,070
Clearly you should not be billed beyond 
the existing suburbs far away beyond the

32
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:18,710
exiting sober.
So where is,

33
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,500
where are these 74 million homes to be 
built?

34
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,790
I would say the obvious answer would be 
to build demolishing,

35
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,520
demolishing thousands,
tens of thousands of hectors.

36
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,020
I'll make 16 sobers,
which where were located?

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,303
Why is the United States so important?
Because this has been an enormous 

38
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,330
influence on what is to happen all over 
the world and I see it,

39
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,250
I see these only means to our way of 
life.

40
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,650
So designing a CD will reality signing 
ways of life,

41
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,820
whatever

42
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,960
we're to do,
or the next 40 or 50 years in developing

43
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:05,170
countries will determine the word 
sustainability,

44
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,540
quality of life and happiness for 
millions.

45
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:08,883
I am absolutely convinced that radically
not designs a very different cities are 

46
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:18,370
possible.
They are very simple.

47
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,204
They are politically very difficult,
but they could lead us to have cities 

48
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:24,334
which are much more sustainable,
where people will live much happier 

49
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:28,654
lives.
