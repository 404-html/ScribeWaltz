What Kara Keller did,
and two,

2
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:05,051
one,
two,

3
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:05,884
eight to 1280 was only the final apt 
long process which started when the 

4
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:14,944
founder of Rome Romulus welcomed 
refugees and asylum seekers to his new 

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,190
city by the Tiber to be proper Roman 
citizens,

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,120
which carried on as citizenship was 
spread among those whom Rome conquered,

7
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,850
and when people from far of field became
Roman emperors,

8
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,110
Trajan and Hadrian from Spain,
Septimius severus from North Africa,

9
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,110
that could never have happened at 
Athens,

10
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:51,903
and at the same time,
slaves in their millions were fruit at 

11
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,683
Rome,
at in the process completely unlike in 

12
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:07,681
the Greek world.
They became full Roman citizens.

13
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,063
Many fewer slaves wherever fried in 
Athens or any of the Greek states in 

14
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:17,140
which we know,
and if they were freed,

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,210
they certainly didn't become citizens.
This was an incorporated community.

16
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,200
Now,
some observant people in Greece early on

17
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,320
spotted these weird habits of the Romans
and they were amazed.

18
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,340
A few of the smartest began to think 
that maybe Roman openness was the secret

19
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,550
of her success,
and that's what I think.

20
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,640
I think too.
I think robes real Rome's rough.

21
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,250
It's in your face.
It's open,

22
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,070
it's welcoming,
and it's us.

23
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,083
Thank you.

24
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,370
Thanks.
