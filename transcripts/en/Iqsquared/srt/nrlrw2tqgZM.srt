1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,960
Well.
So who are the chronic for and why is it

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:04,794
important for a post 2015 a agreement on
sustainable development to think about 

3
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,244
the chronic coupon there are getting 
onto a half a billion people who are 

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,663
poor over many years or for a lifetime 
or possibly pass that property on to 

5
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:25,200
their children.
And they're trapped in poverty,

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,063
partly because of politics,
partly because of the institutions of 

7
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:32,520
the market,
which don't operate in their favor.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,193
And this isn't just because of a dearth 
of opportunities or a lack of economic 

9
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:38,904
growth,
although that is obviously very 

10
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:43,740
important.
So what does it take to,

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,633
um,
get people permanently out of poverty 

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,280
and address chronic poverty?
Uh,

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,610
and what can an international framework 
do to help this on its way?

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,163
It takes good politics,
progressive policies to improve the 

15
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:00,450
situations of these longterm poor 
people.

16
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:01,284
Measures like social assistance,
seeing children through school for many 

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,640
years,
age of pro poorest growth,

18
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,563
uh,
initiatives and a political society 

19
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,390
that's,
uh,

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,630
begins to recognize the needs and 
interests of chronic keep white people.

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,500
That doesn't happen very often because 
chronically bought people don't organize

22
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:26,820
themselves very well.
And so they need allies.

23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,960
The international community can be an 
ally for the chronically poor.

24
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,310
They can set,
uh,

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,750
uh,
poverty eradication goal and targets,

26
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:41,751
which really address chronic poverty.
They can desegregate progress so that we

27
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:48,591
look at the progress made by the bottom 
5% 10% 20% of the population.

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,500
They can,
of course,

29
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,400
set specific goals,
education,

30
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,170
seeing children through nine or 10 years
of,

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,113
of education,
quality education to help them get out 

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,533
of poverty so they can be a major ally.
International community can be a major 

33
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:08,400
ally for the chronic important.
