1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,233
I think government should do three 
things because I would argue that we're 

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,613
actually having a bit of a crisis right 
now and I just got stuck in hideous 

3
00:00:08,651 --> 00:00:10,540
traffic coming across London.
You know,

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,300
London has an infrastructure problem but
the web has a much,

5
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:14,980
much bigger internet.
Sorry.

6
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:15,814
It has a much,
much bigger infrastructure problem if 

7
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:19,780
you like and I think the government 
should focus on three things.

8
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:20,614
Firstly,
we have got to improve the state of our 

9
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:25,030
digital infrastructure urgently.
You know,

10
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:25,864
you don't have to be a rocket scientist 
to see that South Korea knock it out of 

11
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,080
the park all the time in terms of the 
economy and productivity,

12
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:34,540
partly because they have that superfast 
infrastructure.

13
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,374
That's one big piece of the puzzle and 
somewhere that government can be more 

14
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,650
aggressive.
Secondly,

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,890
we have an absolute crisis in gender on 
the Internet.

16
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,060
Massive,
huge,

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:43,923
enormous.

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,330
The percentage of women in the tech and 
creative industries.

19
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:48,550
I saw a report just this week have gone 
down.

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,193
There are now nearly doubled the 
percentage of women in parliament that 

21
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,680
is probably marginally older than the 
tech sector double.

22
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,620
It's a disaster.
It's a disaster because power,

23
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,090
money,
product design,

24
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,240
everything is worse and imbalanced and 
asymmetrical.

25
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:06,010
So that's the second thing where I think
they should intervene.

26
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,170
And the third thing is that q and a 
broad,

27
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,780
a broad,
broader skills crisis,

28
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:18,380
which I worked on for a while,
and now we still have massive issue with

29
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:19,214
the code and the jobs that we need to 
fill and a massive issue in broader 

30
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,383
digital skills,
let alone the skills of our 

31
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,720
establishment and parliamentarians.
And they had three,

32
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:26,554
to me,
very tangible areas that government 

33
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:29,290
could intervene.
They don't even have to touch a big tech

34
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,720
company to make a big shift in those 
areas.
