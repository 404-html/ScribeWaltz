1
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,390
I'm Jonathan Friedland from the 
Guardian.

2
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:11,224
And great pleasure to be moderating or 
chairing perhaps is more appropriate 

3
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:16,450
word.
Um,

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,180
our speakers and our debate for tonight,
as you know,

5
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:20,014
the motion before us is the best chance 
for peace between Israel and Palestine 

6
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:28,630
is for Uncle Sam to butt out and 
American colloquialism.

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,703
Uh,
despite this being a intelligence 

8
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:34,810
squared in London and so much has been 
going on in the whole,

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,750
the wider Middle East across the Arab 
world in particular,

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,690
the so called Arab spring,
the Arab awakening,

11
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:41,524
depending on how you prefer to call it,
that people on both sides of the Israel 

12
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:48,520
Palestine conflict,
uh,

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,383
who said some might accuse of being 
almost addicted to the attention of the 

14
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:56,770
world have been slightly feeling left 
out in recent months.

15
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,790
Um,
because the,

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,530
uh,
attention has moved away,

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,701
uh,
nevertheless,

18
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:03,390
that conflict does still go on.
Um,

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,330
and it's that one very particular aspect
of it that we want to explore tonight.

20
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,643
We are going to be doing something 
different in this debate from some 

21
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,550
debates on this conflict that you may 
have heard before.

22
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:13,384
And it's different in this sense.
We're not aiming for perhaps sometimes 

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,733
what can be accrued debate which pits 
Israelis against Palestinians or even 

24
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:24,730
friends of Israel against friends of the
Palestinians.

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,200
Uh,
rather,

26
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:27,034
all four speakers tonight would insist 
that they are looking for solutions for 

27
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:36,781
indeed resolution rather than simply 
defending one side or the other.

28
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,463
Nevertheless,
within that framework or within that 

29
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,450
context,
uh,

30
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,373
there are,
um,

31
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,293
we will hope they are revealed tonight 
substantial disagreements between them 

32
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:48,780
about how best to achieve that,
uh,

33
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,210
resolution.
Uh,

34
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,720
they are for people who are in their own
different ways,

35
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,220
dedicate much of their professional 
lives to wrestling with this subject and

36
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:59,940
they do it with huge commitment.
Um,

37
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,410
so I think we're very,
very lucky to have them and I'm going to

38
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:06,310
introduce them all one by one as they 
come up to speak.

39
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,290
But first of all,
I just want to,

40
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,143
um,
mention something that you will have 

41
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,160
been doing,
uh,

42
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,200
already,
which is costing your pre vote.

43
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,490
I'm going to give you the result of 
that.

44
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:18,040
The vote that you walked in with the 
vote before,

45
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:22,120
you'd had a chance to be swayed by the 
almost scissor Romanian rhetoric that is

46
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:24,070
going to be unleashed,
uh,

47
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,580
from this panel.
Um,

48
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,330
but there will be,
you will cost a final vote later on.

49
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:29,164
And the way that works is you'll have 
one of these cards if you want to vote 

50
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:31,900
for you,
tear off the four bit.

51
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,030
If you want to bet against you,
turn off the against bit.

52
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:34,864
And if you are an abstention,
you slipped the entire card into a 

53
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,830
ballot box,
almost Vladimir Putin,

54
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:43,480
esc,
where method of voting.

55
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,870
Um,
but we're going to have a very proper in

56
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:48,580
democratic result,
uh,

57
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,000
beef,
uh,

58
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,050
in contrast to their IPAD apps.
Um,

59
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,620
so we're going to do that.
Uh,

60
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:55,480
that's the format and uh,
the rest of it,

61
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:56,980
I'm going to explain more or less as we 
go on.

62
00:02:56,981 --> 00:02:59,560
There is a little new twist in the 
intelligence squared format,

63
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,210
which I hope you're going to enjoy it.
Uh,

64
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:02,230
which we'll come to later.
