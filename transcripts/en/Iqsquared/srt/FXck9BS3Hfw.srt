1
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,443
Square,
welcome to the hall and to tonight's 

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,990
debate,
which is b,

3
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:25,400
where the Dragon Africa should not look 
at China.

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,120
We've got a distinguished panel who 
actually introduce one by one as they go

5
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:36,791
up and speak.
This is a topic which has been something

6
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,204
which has been exercising people here,
I would say for the last five years or 

7
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:42,704
so,
but it's ever more important because 

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,513
with the European and American 
economists flatlining and China's 

9
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:54,740
steaming ahead and African economies 
also seeming ahead.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,873
The world is changing and trade between 
Africa and China has now reached 

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,460
$100,000,000,000 a year.
And I read the other day,

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,333
uh,
that the US assistant secretary of 

13
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:07,394
state,
Johnny Carson said at some point last 

14
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,370
year,
this was a big problem because China was

15
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:14,204
operating in Africa with no morals and 
like everybody else operating in Africa 

16
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,720
whose morals I'm sure completely 
scrupulous and always have been.

17
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,990
But that does go to the heart of the 
debate.

18
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:27,824
Doesn't set.
Is China a model which has lifted 

19
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:32,354
hundreds of millions of its own people 
out of poverty and the Guide and the 

20
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:41,801
benign influence or is trying to 
reinforcing corruption,

21
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:42,963
exploitation?
I think that will be the heart of our 

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,100
debate tonight.
Now,

23
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,620
you would have been polled as you came 
in,

24
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,663
whether you are a fool or against the 
motion and you should also have these 

25
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,510
voting cards.
And so when the,

26
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:57,344
uh,
main species of finished and you've had 

27
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:01,490
the chance to ask a few questions 
yourself,

28
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,710
people will be coming around with ballot
boxes.

29
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:04,544
So we would ask you to tear the sleeping
half and vote for or against as you 

30
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:12,110
wish.
If you really can't make your mind up,

31
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,320
then you put a don't know which is the 
whole slip.

32
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,213
But I hope that our panelists tonight,
we'll be able to sway you one way or 

33
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,374
another.
What's going to happen is everybody's 

34
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:28,160
going to get up and make their speech 
for about 10 minutes,

35
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:28,994
but I'm going to ask each of the 
panelists to stay there after finishing 

36
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:33,284
the speech.
And the opposing team will have some 

37
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,800
quick fire questions for them.
