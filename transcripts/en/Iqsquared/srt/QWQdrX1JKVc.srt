1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,210
What makes it art capital?
Well,

2
00:00:13,211 --> 00:00:16,120
I think I go back to my spin ball 
question at the beginning,

3
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:16,954
which is artists making interesting work
in an artistic environment that's 

4
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,610
conducive for them to make it.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,920
When people talk about London as an art 
capital in very positive terms.

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,320
The word they always use is the word 
they used to only use about New York and

7
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:39,880
that's energy and there's a sense that 
when a,

8
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,743
when a certain dynamic occurs,
an energy that kind of pervasive sense 

9
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:45,704
of energy is produced and this seems to 
me to be an absolute critical thing and 

10
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:51,230
the artists were very central to making 
that happen.

11
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:52,340
But,
but that,

12
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,203
that seems to me to be the,
the edge of difference between a place 

13
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:57,884
that's really got something happening 
and something someplace that's a nice 

14
00:01:00,171 --> 00:01:03,740
showcase or something,
but it doesn't have that inner vitality.

15
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,893
I'd like to say that if there is the 
energy that it will translate into 

16
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,960
something positive.
Um,

17
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:12,843
and I've certainly seen examples as I 
said in South Asia where there hasn't 

18
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:21,031
been government funding.
Whereas cities have become very,

19
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:26,041
very interesting spaces for artists.
But on the other hand,

20
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,383
having seen the examples of Hong Kong 
and Singapore where the government does 

21
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,243
fund various schemes and does fund art 
schools and art education and 

22
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:43,870
institutions and everything else that 
goes along with it,

23
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,213
it is much easier for artists to live in
that environment and for an art capital 

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,550
to grow out of that environment.

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,830
Yeah,
I think it's a city.

26
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:56,730
You just have to be able to attract 
people who are artists,

27
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,653
which is echoing something you said 
earlier and maybe you have to be a bit 

28
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:04,140
of a mess of a city sometimes to do 
that.

29
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,470
You have to be interested in in in ways 
that might be messy ways.

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,353
I mean,
I lived in Los Angeles for a long time 

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,100
and there was a very odd ball art group 
of artists there.

32
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,440
They were really mavericks who didn't 
want to go to New York.

33
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,470
I mean,
by choosing to be in Los Angeles,

34
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:31,200
they were really thumbing their nose at 
the artist stablish mint.

35
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,310
But it included people like every Shay,
Mike,

36
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,490
Kelly,
Paul Mccarthy,

37
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:36,860
Chris Burden,
Raymond Pettibone,

38
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,910
artists who are very well known,
but they were all extremely eccentric,

39
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,733
uh,
and they really didn't want to be part 

40
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:50,151
of this art establishment in La,
especially when I was living.

41
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:51,324
There was much more of a messy place 
just like the way in London in some 

42
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:57,090
ways.
It's kind of a messy labyrinthine city,

43
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,150
uh,
spread out over miles scenerio.

44
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,590
It's,
um,

45
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:05,200
so I think when I think of a place like 
Singapore,

46
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,140
I think it's got to get a little 
dirtier.
