1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,370
In credential guesses?
A fairly good example,

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,443
right?
Will it really be replicable elsewhere 

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:07,800
in the world?
It's the success of North America.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,083
Is that going to happen in China and 
South America and maybe in more modest 

5
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:15,630
form here that's not very certain.
Look at the Bolus Ebay,

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,780
I'll say public debate about fracking.
People don't really sure,

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,730
right?
Why should we do that?

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,043
But if uncle venture guests is 
successful at re doubles the previous 

9
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:30,270
thought resource base of gas and then it
really makes it a real game changer.

10
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:31,104
You can really go for different types of
energy systems in a sense that you can 

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,653
early gains replace coal by guests,
but Su built an big infrastructure 

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,080
system,
uh,

13
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:44,250
on guests.
Also,

14
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:47,700
you start opening up options for the 
future.

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,630
I will call and say you have room to 
maneuver in 2020s,

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,130
2030s because you haven't guests 
infrastructure,

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,000
which is also easily as they'll ask 
extra cost.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,630
They make suitable for hydrogen gas or 
liquid hydrogen.

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,913
So actually my count,
you're lucky because you have an 

20
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,210
infrastructure you can piggy back on.
If you do another roots,

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,403
then you don't have the infrastructure.
And then it becomes very expensive to 

22
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:10,890
introduce hydrogen.
