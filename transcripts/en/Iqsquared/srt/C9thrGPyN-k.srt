1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,770
Britain has a long history of inventing 
brilliant new technologies,

2
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:11,300
processes,
and designs,

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,373
but how do we make sure these 
innovations translate into money making 

4
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,910
products,
companies and industries?

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,163
What is needed in today's turbulent 
economic climate to turn British 

6
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,210
startups into world beaters?

7
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:31,963
Entrepreneurial Spirit is high.
At the beginning of 2012 4.8 million 

8
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:37,874
startups were operating in the UK an 
increase of over 200,000 firms on the 

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,740
previous year.
Securing funding is a real challenge.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,360
In a recent survey,
more than six out of 10 small businesses

11
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,890
said lack of startup capital was the 
barrier they found hardest to overcome.

12
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,243
So what next?
In the USA there has been a surge in 

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,473
crowdfunding.

14
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:13,781
than $660 million for 43,000 product 
offerings and over 4 million people have

15
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:16,454
contributed money in the UK exit of 
based crowd cube has 37,000 registered 

16
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:26,260
investors and has raised over 9 million 
pounds.

17
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,820
Venture capital is also important for 
inspiration.

18
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,850
British policy makers could look to 
Israel,

19
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,713
which attracts more than twice as much 
venture capital per capita than any 

20
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:43,171
other country at $170 per person.
With this model,

21
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,490
Israel has established a world leading 
high tech startup culture,

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,400
impressive for a country of just 7 
million,

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,100
but while venture capital and crowd 
funding are important,

24
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,790
big business has a role to play.

25
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,190
Large firms in Britain have as much as 
750 billion pounds held in reserve.

26
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,050
Many I helping to incubate startups by 
offering a mix of funding,
