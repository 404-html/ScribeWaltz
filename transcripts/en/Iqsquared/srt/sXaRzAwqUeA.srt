1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,240
Oda goes from a developed or developing 
countries,

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,363
it is vertical.
The developing country becomes a middle 

3
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:10,290
income country,
so it graduates from being a recipient,

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,320
then another developing country.
What's to learn from it?

5
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:15,154
Success Story.
So they engage in south south 

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,580
corporation,
efficient demand driven,

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,540
knowledge sharing and capacity building.
And look,

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,593
it's horizontal and it goes both ways.
Now this rent here wants to keep on 

9
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:29,994
engaging with his former partner country
and to scale up together the lessons 

10
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:38,370
learned into this new partner country.
So triangular cooperation is boring.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,350
This is a win,
win,

12
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:45,120
win situation in which all countries in 
both developed and developing share them

13
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:45,954
comparative advantages and work together
with one single thing in my very 

14
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:51,150
policies for better lives.
