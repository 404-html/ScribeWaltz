1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,203
I would suggest,
and I wonder whether you agree that one 

2
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:04,204
thing we can do is actually live up to 
the ideals that we profess to live by 

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,220
and that we professed,
that these countries also should live by

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,323
and just to take an example,
the history of our engagement and the 

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,423
Arabian peninsula over the last hundred 
years is a history of promising freedom 

6
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,064
and democracy,
but in fact doing everything to make 

7
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:28,174
sure that they could never possibly work
because we always put the interests of 

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,283
commercial convenience above the 
interest of those ideals and we 

9
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:39,874
continue.
I pledged to do so in that we allow BA 

10
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:45,064
systems or bp or our dependence on oil 
to come before actually supporting 

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,780
Republican nationalist secular 
governments in the Middle East and we've

12
00:00:58,601 --> 00:00:59,434
always been terrified of them.
So isn't there much more we can do than 

13
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:06,070
just have better chats on the ground?
Can't we actually be true to our ideals?

14
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:16,923
Yes,
we can do much better to be true to our 

15
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:19,571
ideals.
I mean,

16
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:20,404
the history of Britain's involvement in 
the Middle East since the first world 

17
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:24,784
war is,
is shameful what we did after the 

18
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:27,604
collapse of the Ottoman Empire.
The way we connived with the Syrian 

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,473
French colony.
The way we created a colony in Iraq was 

20
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:36,370
shameful.
So yes,

21
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:40,480
we can,
but and this is another thing,

22
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,410
let's not be so carried away with an 
illusory nature of what we are.

23
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:50,770
Our allies are or can be into the bigger
danger,

24
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,100
which is that we talk so much about our 
ideals.

25
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:54,934
We lived the dream of our principals so 
much that we raised the expectation of 

26
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:02,320
people in other countries in ways that 
were unable to fulfill.

27
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,980
Probably the thing that actually hits me
hardest about Iraq

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,100
was that our presence there on the 
ground and my experience than me son,

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,500
is that the more I talked about human 
rights,

30
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,334
the more I talked about our principles,
the more encouraged people to come 

31
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:19,024
forward.
Haida who worked with me as my 

32
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:22,630
translator or women who joined our 
provincial council,

33
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,273
who would subsequently killed by the 
militia and who we've done absolutely 

34
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:31,444
nothing to protect or,
or to get out of the country because we 

35
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,450
did what we couldn't do.
We exceeded our resources,

36
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:38,284
we made promises we couldn't fulfill and
we raised expectations which we were 

37
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:46,300
unable to do anything about.
So I think that's almost the crueler the

38
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:47,134
trail.
