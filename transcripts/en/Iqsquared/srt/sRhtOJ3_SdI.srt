1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,163
The average time a person spends and 
displacement or refugee spends and 

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,420
displacement to 17 years.
That's just the average time.

3
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:10,050
We have people that are born and bred 
and grow up in refugee camps.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,230
The Syrians that have been sitting in 
Syria,

5
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:14,770
in Jordan,
Lebanon and,

6
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:16,830
and then moved on to Turkey,
um,

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,540
have not been able to access the bare 
minimum of,

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,870
of subsistence for themselves.
We have talked to people that have moved

9
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:28,860
on because they haven't found education,
decent education for their children,

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,743
healthcare.
And I think this really speaks to the 

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,353
beginnings of the refugee regime.
The refugee regime was crafted in 1951 

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,523
it was crafted at a time and a place 
where persecution was the reason for 

13
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:42,084
movement.
Civil and political rights were 

14
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:46,410
privileged over economic,
social and cultural rights.

15
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:50,400
The idea of somebody moving because they
saw no future for themselves,

16
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:54,720
they saw no future for their family with
was somehow put in a second tier.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,673
But what we are seeing now is precisely 
people saying that that's not the way 

18
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:00,354
that we can live our lives.
We don't have the right to work in 

19
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:03,534
Turkey in Jordan.
We have no education for our children 

20
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,670
and no health care.
So in a sense,

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,653
this is what you're seeing.
You're seeing the combination of a 

22
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:16,170
governance system that is in desperate 
need of fixing.
