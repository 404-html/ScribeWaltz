Dirty joke,
in Ernst,

2
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,203
Lubitsch masterpiece Ninotchka the hero 
visits a cafeteria and orders coffee 

3
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,213
without cream,
and here is the wonderful lip reply of 

4
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:32,020
the waiter.
Sorry,

5
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,350
we have run out of cream.
We only have milk.

6
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,870
Can I then bring you coffee without 
milk?

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,700
I think it's absolutely a correct 
answer.

8
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,133
It's not the same thing.
Coffee without cream or coffee without 

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,770
milk.
What you don't get,

10
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,690
it's part of the identity of what you do
get in what sense?

11
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,520
Because if you bring this logic to its 
extreme,

12
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,690
you can also see how a double negation 
when you don't have just when you do not

13
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,520
have,
in this case,

14
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:13,060
coffee without cream or milk.
The result is not zero,

15
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,163
but what another.
My last example from popular culture 

16
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,850
from,
I think it's from early nineties,

17
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:22,684
you remember the movie with Ethan 
Mcgregor before he became a trader when 

18
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:29,140
he was still playing a working class.

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,380
Guys brassed off the hero accompanies,
took her home after their date.

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,270
A young pretty woman who at the entrance
to her flat tells Kim,

21
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,720
would you like to come in for a coffee?
He answers there is a problem.

22
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:46,870
I don't drink,
drink,

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,870
drink coffee.
She retorts with a smile.

24
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,670
No problem.
I don't have any.

25
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,150
What I like is that you know what?
You get through this.

26
00:01:55,151 --> 00:02:00,151
Double negation is probably the most,
not vulgar,

27
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:04,690
but open erotic invitation.
Like that's my point.

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,793
I invite you for a coffee.
Then I negate coffee and the result is 

29
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:13,480
not zero.
The result is beautiful invitation.
