1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,453
There's a new hierarchy and tone and 
it's the hierarchy of Silicon Valley to 

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,990
the people who run these companies.
There is an astonishing sense of power,

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,333
but in the last 12 months there's been a
realization that as they say in the 

4
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:22,710
spiderman movies with great power comes 
great responsibility and a great deal of

5
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:27,180
trouble too if you don't know how to 
manage that responsibility.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,111
Of course,
Neil,

7
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,000
most of those,
if probably all,

8
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:30,834
almost all of those silicon valley 
Internet billionaires would have 

9
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:36,270
preferred Hillary Clinton of compressed 
the United States and she didn't.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,090
So to their utter horror,
and it really was,

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,170
it was really kind of fascinating to 
watch up close.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,513
They found that the network platforms 
they'd created could be used to achieve 

13
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:55,191
the opposite of what they had intended.
It was not the Clinton administration,

14
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,203
the Clinton campaign that knew how to 
use facebook to target advertising in 

15
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:02,940
order to secure the swing states.

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,900
It was the trump campaign.
It was Steve Bannon and jared Kushner,

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,513
not to mention Russian intelligence,
but we are in the midst of a great 

18
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,970
expose a,
which is not over,

19
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,283
that is going to reveal the extent to 
which trump campaign in a large way and 

20
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:21,954
the Russian intelligence network in a 
small way used facebook and to a lesser 

21
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:26,844
extent,
other platforms to achieve victory in 

22
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:32,760
the 2016 presidential election.
And I argue in the book,

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,510
and I stand by it,
that Donald Trump would not be president

24
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:37,344
today if there had not been facebook and
twitter and the other platforms that 

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,430
were used,
uh,

26
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,740
in a conventional,
traditional American election campaign,

27
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,023
he would have been defeated because he 
would've been out spent Hillary Clinton 

28
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,300
outspent Donald Trump two to one more 
than two to one,

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,833
uh,
on standard cable and terrestrial 

30
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:00,660
television advertising,
he would have lost.

31
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,560
So this was a hugely significant moment 
in American political history.

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,753
I still don't think people realize the 
extent to which it depended on the use 

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,370
of facebook in particular.
