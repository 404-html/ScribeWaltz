1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,210
There's been this enormous increase in 
inequality and that it has multiple,

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,230
multiple dimensions.
Uh,

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,410
there,
there is,

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,380
uh,
more money at the top,

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,950
uh,
at the beginning,

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,640
uh,
I,

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,510
Eh,
in Reagan when Reagan in 1980,

8
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:26,970
he started pushing for the kinds of 
changes in economic policy.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,810
Uh,
it was,

10
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:29,644
uh,
there was an awareness that those 

11
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:35,730
policies would lead to more,
more inequality.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,120
Um,
the idea was that,

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,920
uh,
you lower tax rates at the top and you,

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,083
uh,
free up the economy and deregulate and 

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,230
the hope was the idea was that it would,
yes,

16
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:55,650
there'll be more inequality,
but the size of the pie would increase.

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,813
So much so that everybody,
even those in the middle of the bottom 

18
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,394
would be better off.
They would get a bigger piece even if 

19
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:08,910
they got a smaller share.
Well,

20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,650
we've had a third of a century now of 
this experiment

21
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,950
and we can see the outcome.

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,073
They were right,
that it would include increased 

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,133
inequality
and the sheer going to the top 1% has 

24
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:31,790
gone to numbers between 20 and 25%.
Uh,

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,830
that's it.
Two fold increase in the share,

26
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:35,664
going to the top,
one 10th of 1% has increased three to 

27
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:42,060
four fold.
But unfortunately,

28
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:42,894
this idea of trickle down economics that
everybody would benefit is absolutely 

29
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:46,824
wrong.
And what does actually happen is median 

30
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:56,211
income make I'm in the middle,
has stagnated income at the bottom.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You saved him worse.
So in the middle income today,

32
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:02,844
the median income of a in the United 
States adjusted for inflation is lower 

33
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:11,580
than it was a quarter of a century ago.
And at the bottom,

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,070
the minimum wage has not increased for 
45 years.

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,120
So I think then an economic system that 
doesn't increase standards of living for

36
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:24,774
a majority of its citizens over a period
of a quarter century end of the bottom 

37
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,450
has people worse off than they were 
almost 50 years ago is a failed economic

38
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:34,370
system.

39
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,370
Ah.
