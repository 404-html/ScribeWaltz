1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
So we really got to gender.
I think that,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,033
uh,
there's been a tremendous change over 

3
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:05,574
the last century.
It may be the biggest social change in 

4
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:13,110
thousands of years of history for 
thousands of years.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,550
You had so many different revolutions,
political,

6
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,190
social and economic.
So many different things changed.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,400
But this basic patriarchal structure of 
most human societies,

8
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:29,850
at least the more the bigger human 
societies didn't change.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,673
And over the last hundred years you see 
a really fundamental change in the 

10
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:37,194
status of women.
And in the relation in gender relations 

11
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:40,494
in general,
it's still very far from being a 

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,710
completely ugly and society and it's 
questionable whether it,

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,820
it will be possible ever to have a 
complete legal in society.

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,140
But,
uh,

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,810
uh,
I wouldn't say that,

16
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,440
uh,
nothing has been done or accomplished in

17
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:01,590
the last few decades looking to the 
future.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,130
And it's also links to,
to the,

19
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:08,170
to the other question,
I'm not sure they'll still be genders in

20
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,820
50 or a hundred or a hundred and 50 
years.

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,493
Uh,
with this new ability to re engineered 

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,723
to create bodies and brains and minds as
the basic products of the 21st century 

23
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:24,114
economy,
the most fundamental structures of the 

24
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:33,840
human body and mind them themselves 
might change.

25
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,003
So I'm not so sure that 100 years from 
now people will have a clear agenda of 

26
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,370
just one gender.
Uh,

27
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:45,900
just to give an example of what is 
starting to happen.

28
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,200
Um,
in mutual realities,

29
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,034
for example,
it's very easy for a person to adopt a 

30
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:56,550
different gender,
a to change genders,

31
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,580
to construct all kinds of alternative 
genders.

32
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,683
And you have today like kids,
Eh boys will play the role as girls and 

33
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,780
vice versa.
In,

34
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,020
as other towns in virtual world today,
it's still very primitive.

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,320
You sit in front of the computer and 
it's a two dimensional reality.

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,660
But in 30 years,
50 years,

37
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,743
a more and more off life might be 
transferred into a three dimensional 

38
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,723
virtual reality,
which provides people with far more 

39
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:31,521
excitement and far more interest than 
the drab life in the outside world.

40
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,350
In an economy where they are no longer 
needed.

41
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,363
And the political system which we in 
which they have no power and in such a 

42
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,300
situation,
I mean it's,

43
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:45,000
it's,
I wouldn't just take it for granted that

44
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,863
the gender structure familiar to us 
today and for thousands of years in the 

45
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,430
past will still be relevant in,
in 50 or 100 years.
