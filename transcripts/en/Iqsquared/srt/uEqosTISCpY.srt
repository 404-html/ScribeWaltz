1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,500
The millions of goods that are being 
educated.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,740
The millions of children that are 
getting vaccines,

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:07,843
the thousands of civil society 
organizations that have been 

4
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:11,324
strengthened in the fight for human 
rights and in the fight against 

5
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:14,474
corruption should made us proud about 
eight because this is what aid is being 

6
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:19,274
used for.
These are the red hots that aid is 

7
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:23,090
producing.
At the same time,

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,670
the development financing landscape is 
changing dramatically.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,020
Countries are racing more domestic 
resources through taxation.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,630
Private sector is investing more and new
donors are playing an increasing role.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,890
So in this context,
does it have a future?

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,260
My answer is yes.

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,770
Okay.

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,603
The other question is,
is that future going to be the same as 

15
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:54,040
in the past?
My answer is equally clear.

16
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,203
No.
In order to remain relevant in this 

17
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:01,960
changing landscape,
eight has got to become smarter.

18
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,063
What does that mean in practice?
To me it means at least the things it 

19
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:08,170
means.
First of all,

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,970
that is going to be used where it's most
needed in countries,

21
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:18,270
areas to people that have less access to
other sources of funding.

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,673
Secondly,
it's got to be used to strengthen 

23
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:26,230
countries own capacities.
To solve their problems.

24
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,183
So the lessons of the Paris Declaration 
of the and agenda for action and of the 

25
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,100
somme used country systems,
they are still relevant.

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,533
But thirdly,
it's got to be used smarter to catalyze 

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,770
other sources of funding,
to help mobilize private funding,

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,280
to help increase taxation,
to help use remittances better,

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,390
uh,
for development.

30
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,493
And I think if we use eight smarter than
it will be possible to continue to 

31
00:01:59,111 --> 00:01:59,944
convince taxpayers in countries that are
struggling at present that aid is 

32
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,820
relevant also in the future.
