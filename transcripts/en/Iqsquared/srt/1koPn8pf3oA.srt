1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,420
You weren't like the Segway,
but I'm going to go for it anyway.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,390
One of the things that the trump 
campaign did was exactly that.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,373
He connected with hearts.
He managed to get emotion on the 

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,570
campaign trail.
I'm sure you were at the rallies.

5
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:16,404
I was at the rallies.
They were noisier and they were more 

6
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:22,140
passionate than any other one that I 
attended and I did a lot.

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,123
So the question is,
if the left wants to get back into the 

8
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:27,504
business of winning,
does it have to find an emotional 

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,640
message of politics?
Does that sound like the right way or do

10
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:38,614
you,
or would you consider that to be a sort 

11
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:42,330
of a populous trap?
How would you.

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,340
No,
I think it's a very important insights.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,193
One that I share.
I'm a big believer that people actually 

14
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:52,620
don't listen through their ears.
They listen through their stomachs,

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,760
and if you as a leader or reporter 
connect to someone on a gut level,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,970
their usual attitude is don't bother me 
with the details,

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,520
and if you don't connect with them on a 
gut level,

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,340
you can't show them enough details.
Could I see that?

19
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:07,650
Third Point you made,
just one more time.

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,130
And so what was Hillary Clinton's most 
off quoted line in this campaign?

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,480
Visit my website,
www dot hillary clinton.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,620
It wasn't connecting at the gauntlet was
visit my website and um,

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,250
and I was making this point a friendly 
on results.

24
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:27,084
Here is a brilliant writer and Leon 
wieseltier wants describe Utok Rabine 

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,990
the Israeli prime minister as a bastard 
for peace.

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,353
Okay.
And I think that's what the left needs 

27
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:37,600
in America.
They need a,

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,170
a,
someone who can connect with people on a

29
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:43,290
gut level,
but take them in a progressive direction

30
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:46,290
forward not where trump wants to take 
them,

31
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,780
which I believe is to a dark corner 
backward.

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,890
And that's what the left needs.
Obama had some of that.

33
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,190
I'm not all of it.
Bill Clinton had some of that.

34
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,473
Um,
but,

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,940
uh,
I don't see anyone on the national stage

36
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,460
in America today who really has that.
