1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,800
I am pro intervention with respect to 
Syria,

2
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,920
but pro intervention with the following 
caveat,

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,030
I think intervention at this point is 
inevitable.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,010
I don't see how this regime,
although it's fall,

5
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:18,844
might be construed as inevitable.
That's certainly with the White House 

6
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:21,714
has been saying it could still very well
carry on for at least a year if not 

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,550
more.
Can you define,

8
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:31,230
define for us what I believe in this 
sort of safe zone scenario for Syria,

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:34,590
one that is being now mooted by the 
Turkish government,

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,463
uh,
which has been threatened to be imposed 

11
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:37,950
by the Turkish government since last 
June.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,010
And I also would agree that there needs 
to be some kind of aerial component.

13
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:41,844
I mean the rebels cannot face a tanks 
and helicopter gunships which are now 

14
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:47,154
firing on them alone.
There needs to be some kind of a full 

15
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,810
scale,
a military intervention.

16
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,360
By that I don't mean out in occupation.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,193
All Iraq,
I'm talking about things that are 

18
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:56,364
already being put into motion are 
already being considered by the United 

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,233
States and by Turkey.
So an enforced no fly zone for snow 

20
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,210
flies.
I'm to just harder you through this,

21
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,053
but could that be light on the sort of 
Libya model where that means not just 

22
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:12,840
enforcing it but actually taking out 
soon air to air defense capability?

23
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:13,561
Yes,
and also,

24
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:14,394
I mean,
keep in mind a no fly zone doesn't just 

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,730
necessarily bomb barracks.
In fact,

26
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:19,830
I don't think that in this case that's,
that's called for it.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,833
Um,
it would also target the placement of 

28
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:23,904
hell heavy artillery tanks.
It would also control the [inaudible] 

29
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:27,744
highway,
which is the main ground transport 

30
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:30,114
throughout all of Syria.
You cannot really can conduct this kind 

31
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:32,994
of ground campaign against the rebels if
you can't operate on the main 

32
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:37,380
thoroughfares of the country.
So yes,

33
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:39,510
it would be similar to,
to Olivia style intervention,

34
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:40,640
but not exactly.
Of course,

35
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,483
the two countries are vastly different 
in many ways now deem your shaking your 

36
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:44,070
head.

37
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,760
This has disastrous go.
If this option goes,

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,490
you don't know what,
what,

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
what the capabilities of,
of,

40
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,530
of the Syrian army,
we're talking about one of the mightiest

41
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,020
armies in the Middle East with,
with tanks and heavy alternately and,

42
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,610
and war ships and jet fighters.
And,

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,833
and what are you going to destroy and 
how much are you going to destroy 

44
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:11,280
without going into a full war with the 
country?

45
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,400
I mean,
this is absolute disastrous option.

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,640
The intervention will,
will open the country into a,

47
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,563
an abyss.
