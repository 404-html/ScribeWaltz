00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,403
Ladies and gentlemen,
although important progress has been 

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:08,340
made in recent years to reduce poverty 
today,

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,180
one point 2 billion people are still in 
extreme poverty.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,463
Combating poverty means revisiting our 
global development goals to ensure that 

5
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:21,060
they respond to the day's needs and 
realities.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,693
Poverty is a multidimensional challenge 
that impacts the wellbeing of citizens 

7
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:33,480
in societies worldwide.
It goes beyond material deprivation,

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,500
affecting people's health,
their self esteem,

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,780
and their ability to participate in 
society and connect with other people.

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,083
It also hampers development by reducing 
society's capacity to innovate and 

11
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:55,731
promote progress.
This is why our quest for ending poverty

12
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:02,810
calls for measures that go beyond the 
income to address inequality,

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,150
sustainability,
inclusiveness,

14
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,493
and wellbeing.
Tonight's discussion will shed light on 

15
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:16,701
what we can and must do to address one 
of the most formidable challenges of the

16
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:24,591
21st century ending poverty completely 
forever.

17
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,823
So let's dedicate all our efforts,
all our energy and all our expertise to 

18
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:38,640
this most worthy undertaking.
