Welcome to today's hot topic from 
intelligence squared.com.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,440
Too much free speech kills the massacre 
in Arizona.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,340
Shows that the USA must learn from 
Europe to curb hate speech.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,150
Do you agree?
The Lone gunman who mowed down Gabrielle

5
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:16,984
giffords was mentally disturbed,
but were the outcomes of his ravings 

6
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:22,540
caused by the climate of political 
hostility.

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,700
Sarah Pailin,
for example,

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,390
had placed gunsight icons on Gifford's 
congressional district.

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,703
Does this mean she shares in the 
responsibility for what happened in 

10
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:35,240
Britain?
Politician filled Willis was stripped of

11
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:39,440
his seat and his party membership for 
the kind of polarizing language.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,810
That's an everyday occurrence in the 
USA.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,430
So who has got it right?
Does liberal democracy need you to get a

14
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:47,264
thick skin or does it need a strong 
state protecting us from extreme verbal 

15
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:51,614
assault?
Here are some highlights from Wendy 

16
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:56,690
kaminer confronting Femi autogenous as 
they thrash it out.

17
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,960
We start with femi defending curbs on 
hate speech.

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,320
Less,
less hate will be bread,

19
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,243
and so we would have less fear.
I think that hate speech can certainly 

20
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:16,110
be a contributing factor to bigotry and 
prejudice.

21
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:16,790
And I'm,
you know,

22
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,623
I'm not,
I'm not here defending the merits of 

23
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,260
hate speech,
but I,

24
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:22,981
I,
you know,

25
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:26,550
as I said,
I think it is always much more dangerous

26
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:31,551
and I also think that it's morally wrong
to criminalize speech that we don't like

27
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,750
because we have some sense that in the 
long run it's going to be,

28
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,224
it's going to cause societal harm.
People should be given the right to 

29
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:47,710
speak yes to the point where it violates
the rights of others.

30
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,210
People may be given the right to express
their concerns about principles,

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,533
but not about individual characteristics
that people I'm grateful and proud to 

32
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:01,944
live in a country and to be part of a 
nation that does not tolerate hate 

33
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:10,731
speech is if anything that perhaps our 
restrictions and hate speech have go far

34
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:13,494
enough.
If I can take this opportunity to 

35
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:15,924
respond quickly to some of the things 
that the first day I really appreciate 

36
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:23,910
her forthrightness in questioning why we
need to have freedom of speech.

37
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,773
Because that's not a statement that you 
will generally hear from people in the 

38
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:32,010
US who defend hate speech regulation.
Because here,

39
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:34,920
um,
it's not really so acceptable to say,

40
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,720
I don't believe in free speech.
