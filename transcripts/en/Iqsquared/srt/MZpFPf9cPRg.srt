1
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,273
That cannot be stopped.
This whole debate and we'll always be 

2
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:43,580
colored by what we choose to see.
In truth,

3
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,860
not to see if
we cannot talk seriously.

4
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,430
You know,
this is not 1989 anymore.

5
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,540
I wonder whether when they say I'll pray
for you,

6
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,823
he gives that wonderful reply.
I'll think for you was looking forward 

7
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,543
to Mary Beard,
speaking out for Berlusconi and Boris 

8
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:10,161
here making the case for series a.
We run the unselfish or wearing a hat.

9
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,433
He's,
I think this shouldn't just be a yes or 

10
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:17,130
no swipe and the shit that made me 
smarter so he decides.

11
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,670
I think we can raise the bar from that.
I don't pick it.

12
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,470
Just a matter of communication and a lot
of people as well and looking for it and

13
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:30,060
an old tiny our creativity,
our humanism,

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,840
I doubt very much
whether you like it or not,

15
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:55,230
the Internet is going to happen.
We're going to join us.

16
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,280
We should be calling an end to the war 
on drugs.

17
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:13,281
What we need to read Spanish society.
Of course hip hop enhanced the society.

18
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,410
Democracy is not always the best form of
government.

19
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,453
Barack Obama is ultimately an American 
Patriot Catholic Church and is a force 

20
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:29,220
for good in the world.
Are you getting the message?

21
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:33,540
There is a reason
because they matter.
