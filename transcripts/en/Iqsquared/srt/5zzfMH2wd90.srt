1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
It was what we haven't talked about is 
collaboration.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,570
Yeah.
Eddie sort of creativity,

3
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:05,190
whatever you are.
Even if you're a fine artist,

4
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:06,024
it is about collaboration and you are 
quite specific about what you bring to 

5
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:11,040
the party,
the visual,

6
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,850
the imaginative.
But you always work with great writers.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,753
Oh,
I have to because I'm not a very good 

8
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:17,580
writer.
I mean,

9
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:21,360
I can write situation,
I can write the ideas,

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,680
I can have ideas about the characters,
but I don't write good dialogue.

11
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:26,514
It's very simple.
And so I always work with people who 

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,210
can,
and I'd love working.

13
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:32,260
And I think that comes from,
you know,

14
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,070
once you're in a group like pies.
And,

15
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,023
um,
even though I was separate to some 

16
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:38,730
degree,
it was always collaborative.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,953
And I love working with other people.
And there's one reason I got bored with 

18
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:45,810
animation because it's just me and the 
paper.

19
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,180
And I love other people's ideas.
I love the,

20
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:51,014
the,
the need that I have to argue for why I 

21
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:54,990
want something.
I've got to convince somebody else,

22
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:57,180
which is very important.
We're just saying I want it.

23
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,310
Um,
and so the whole process,

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,320
and I,
I love also,

25
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,343
and that's when the actors really become
wonderful cause you spent a year or so 

26
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:06,660
writing it,
repairing it,

27
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:08,670
getting all,
everything ready and you go to work.

28
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,540
And now the actors come in and I spent a
lot of time choosing hopefully the right

29
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,680
people.
Uh,

30
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,940
and then they come in with very 
different ideas about how to do a scene.

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,410
And so the daily business of shooting 
becomes surprising all the time.

32
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:23,244
It's interesting.
Yeah.

33
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,750
It will be on your toes.
It's not,

34
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,930
it's not me just following my 
storyboards process.

35
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,590
Yeah.
And it's an a seeing the process.

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,040
It's very organic consents and nature 
comes in and rains when it's supposed to

37
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:39,750
be a sunny day for every,
these are shifting it.

38
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,800
So the whole process is alive.
It doesn't mean it's fun.

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,233
It's,
yeah,

40
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,780
most of the time I'm screaming and 
tearing my hair out because it's not the

41
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:51,560
way I want it.
But that's,

42
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,640
but the point is to surround yourself 
with people who are really good,

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,410
who are opinionated,
who don't,

44
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,430
who aren't.
Yes ma'am.

45
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,120
I watched so many filmmakers and see 
they're surrounded by yes,

46
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,540
peak events and no,
I want people that argue with me.

47
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,950
They'd say,
what are you doing?

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,993
I mean,
I remember the first time we were doing 

49
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,800
time Bennett's I'd got myself in a 
corner,

50
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:14,634
literally shooting into a corner and a 
whole set is back there and I couldn't 

51
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:18,774
quite make it work.
And the prop guy came by the prop guy 

52
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:22,620
and he said,
what are you doing terry?

53
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,200
And he prop guy talking to direct like 
that.

54
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:28,680
Wait a minute,
there's a hierarchy hierarchy here.

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,290
But he said,
what are you doing here?

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,240
Why don't we just do that?
And basically,

57
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:35,160
is it Gabby?
And then he said,

58
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,680
I just didn't stop.
He's absolutely right.

59
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,010
And so ever since then I just listened 
to everybody and I'm not,

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,753
um,
new robotic or insecure to reject all 

61
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:48,834
these ideas because ultimately I'm smart
enough to know that I have the ultimate 

62
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,190
power of deciding Yay or nay.
And I keep saying to people,

63
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,100
because people think I'm an old tour.
Uh,

64
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,520
I'm not.
I'm a field to,

65
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,230
yeah,
that's all I was coming from everybody.

66
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,690
And I get the credit or blame,
that's my job.
