1
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,820
How I described the situation is that is
the opposition,

2
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:13,803
but is the regime and both are fighting 
for the power and that the red line in 

3
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:24,100
Syria is the power the chair.
I don't.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,160
I do not see that the red line is 
neither for the opposition,

5
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,820
nor for the regime is the country.
The difference is enormous.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,713
You can the opposition,
they're after power rather the country 

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,450
now it is.
It is what we say in Arabic,

8
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,940
which means a winning or losing the 
power.

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,650
So for me,
what I feel is what I.

10
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,820
When I look at the opposition,
I don't feel they represent me.

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,750
When I look at the aging,
definitely

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,780
presenting and that implies a kind of 
equality kind of parity between the two.

13
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:07,930
Here are these two forces fighting for 
power.

14
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:08,803
Do you think that's right?
Is there a kind of parody between 

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,040
opposition in government in Syria?

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,033
I think who is fighting for the country 
who wants to put the country first 

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,180
rather than the chair rather than 
grasping the pallet?

18
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,693
I disagree Turkey with what she said 
simply because there is no real 

19
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,670
opposition yet that has formed in any 
political sense,

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,073
and this is very much to do with the 
fact that the notion of an opposition 

21
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,663
has totally obliterated from Syrian 
polity and Syria and life and Syrian 

22
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:47,910
minds.
Um,

23
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,863
what we have seen over the past year and
weeks is the creation of a groundswell 

24
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,730
movement that has taken over the whole 
of the country.

25
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,130
So it's no longer in humps or in 
Adelaide or in other areas in Syria.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,940
It is everywhere in the country.
So this parity,

27
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:13,774
so called parity simply does not exist.
And the idea that the opposition is 

28
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:22,881
fighting for a chair I think is quite 
bizarre to me anyway.

29
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,453
Um,
let's just hear your view of it because 

30
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,151
you were there.
Yeah,

31
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,680
I think it's,
it's actually betty,

32
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:35,060
betty simple at the moment,
the battle in Syria,

33
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,140
the conflict in Syria at the moment,
it boils down to one word,

34
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,740
and that is actually survival,
survival,

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,540
survival.
And that's what people are fighting for.

36
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,520
Rob,
at this point in time,

37
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:47,390
people are fighting to stay alive.
You know,

38
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:48,224
they every tonight nicer indicated no,
there was no political push from within 

39
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:55,370
Syria.
It's a fight to stay alive day to day.
