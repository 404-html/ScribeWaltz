1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,300
Jesus christ said that the poor will 
always be among,

2
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:07,530
you know,
for the first time in human history,

3
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:10,530
we have the chance to eradicate absolute
poverty.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,080
We have all the resources needed.
It's less,

5
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:16,560
much less than 1% of the economic output
of the world.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,843
We know how to do it and it is done.
Them and China alone has brought 600 

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,140
million people of the poverty in the 
last few decades.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,243
And we have reduced absolute poverty by 
1% every year since 19 1919 but there's 

9
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:38,610
also be a frank reaching the last part 
will be more difficult.

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,790
They living in franchise states.
Most folks in the,

11
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,920
in the country side,
they are women.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,060
They belong to national minorities to be
a hard task.

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,510
But it is possible just about mobilizing
the political will to get the dumb.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,000
So that's a revoke the old slogan.
Yes,

15
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:57,834
we can.
