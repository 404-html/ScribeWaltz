Let me remind you of the votes as you 
came in.

2
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,623
51 don't knows.
That's gone to home to 10 and then we 

3
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:26,221
had 119 four and 84 against.
We're now at 127 against.

4
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,980
In other words,
you've done a pretty good job,

5
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,370
but not quite good enough with 139 
agreeing with the motion.

00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,690
Thank you very much.
