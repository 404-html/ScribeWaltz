1
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,330
That we've witnessed innocent people 
being slaughtered on an industrial scale

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,323
in Syria.
My feeling is now one that you cannot 

3
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:19,943
allow an armed mafia to take revenge on 
an entire country without allowing some 

4
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:28,584
protection for civilians.
Now what that kind of protection might 

5
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:37,830
take is something that we have all 
Assyrians debated very painfully.

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,933
It's not an easy thing to say with the 
example of Iraq fresh in our mind that 

7
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,610
yes,
we do want military intervention,

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,653
but I think what we do absolutely need 
our safe corridors that would enable 

9
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,490
families of displaced persons to reach 
safety without being killed.

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,950
We would need safe corridors for 
defectors.

11
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,780
The reason we don't have the kind of 
detection on a large scale from the army

12
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,763
is because the price of defection is 
intolerably high and it's not just the 

13
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:17,340
people that affect your shot.

14
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,390
When people hear the phrase safe 
corridor,

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,900
think who could be against safe corridor
was,

16
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,440
it sounds wonderful,
but to do that,

17
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:24,274
to enforce it will mean heavy duty and 
that what will others that are not in 

18
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:31,534
the room now worn is that that will mean
a huge unleashing of the kind of blood 

19
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,250
boil.

20
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,170
Well,
we already have a blood bath of.

21
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,650
Yeah.
Can I,

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:40,973
I want to get in on this because I want 
to know just how it felt when you were 

23
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:47,550
there that moment when you were an 
attack,

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,410
but even before then when you saw people
being.

25
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,583
Did you yourself think the only way to 
solve this is the outside world has to 

26
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,760
act?

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,670
Absolutely.
It's one thing,

28
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,180
I guess seeing it from a distance to be 
involved in it,

29
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:02,014
to watch it,
to watch people dying for a piece of 

30
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:04,924
bread,
the risks people were taking just to 

31
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:09,340
feed themselves.
Um,

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,530
there is no option.
You know,

33
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,410
they are a well trained army,
but it was actually pointed out to me by

34
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:15,244
many military defectors,
high level military defectors that the 

35
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:20,020
Syrian army is a big,
powerful arm.

36
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:25,021
It's also not an army that is actually 
trained to fight was whether the army as

37
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:25,924
an army base,
there are several suppression of 

38
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,850
civilians,
so when it comes to taking out,

39
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,560
as would be the case if we're to create 
safe and safe havens,

40
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,853
they're.
They're not such big guys when it comes 

41
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,034
to that.
They're very good that I'm surrounded 

42
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:44,950
civilians and killing them.

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,873
In other words,
what the kind of remedies that Michael 

44
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,490
Weiss has application application using 
the price wouldn't be so unbearable.

45
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,890
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

46
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:54,040
I think that,
you know,

47
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:54,880
we,
we,

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,713
we,
we overestimate the scale and the size 

49
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:58,824
of the city and capability to fight back
when it is an army and civilian 

50
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:05,034
population.
