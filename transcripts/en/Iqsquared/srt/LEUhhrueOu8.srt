1
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,160
I,
I think the situation has gone too far.

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,750
Uh,
it,

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,673
uh,
it will not be possible I think to get 

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,940
the opposition to sit down with a sad.
So where,

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,490
where does that leave us?
In my view,

6
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,340
you have to,
um,

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,550
you have to try to level the playing 
field and do so as quickly as possible.

8
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:34,110
Now we've seen the decisions,
uh,

9
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:34,944
in Istanbul a,
I can assure you there's a lot more 

10
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,411
going on.
I'm,

11
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:39,690
I'm,
I'm convinced,

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,430
uh,
beneath the radar.

13
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,301
I mean,
you know,

14
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:43,134
paying salaries to the FSA and what 
exactly they're gonna be put on some 

15
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:48,230
payroll or something.
Uh,

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,760
no,
I mean we need to get cash and a,

17
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:52,800
and a lot of it,
um,

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,663
to the opposition that there are ways to
encourage the process of defections a 

19
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:02,940
that's already going on.
I think this has to be pursued as,

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,833
as energetically as possible in order to
hurt the asad regime and begin to get 

21
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:13,170
the kind of balance where some kind of 
negotiated outcome might be possible.

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,820
I don't think Roger,
just before we go on there,

23
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:17,280
when you say giving cash,
do you go further and say arms,

24
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,570
its arms,
arms,

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,600
cash,
uh,

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,360
uh,
logistics,

27
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,220
uh,
where with the,

28
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,000
I mentioned I'm not in,
I mean,

29
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,100
in an election year,
uh,

30
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:28,400
with Iran hovering in the background,
uh,

31
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,500
with Israel where it is on Syria,
uh,

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,670
I don't see a NATO planes in the skies 
of a Siri.

33
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:36,640
I just,
I mean,

34
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:37,474
I,
I'm trying to deal here with realistic 

35
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:39,924
options.
I don't regard that as a real estate 

36
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,110
option.
Ain't going to happen,

37
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:46,050
at least not in my view.
So that leaves me,

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,213
um,
given that I don't think the Annan plan 

39
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:50,094
can work,
that leaves me with a arm support 

40
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:56,040
bolster
the FSA,

41
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,874
the rebels,
and try and get them to be as coherent 

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,640
and effective as possible.
