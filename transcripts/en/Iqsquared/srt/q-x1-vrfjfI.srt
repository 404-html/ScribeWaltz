1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,363
The international community has been 
terribly good at coming up with bryce 

2
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:13,510
ideas.
I'm clever solutions to the problems.

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,523
Besetting nations like Pakistan,
they have been woefully poor at 

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,340
implementing those ideas.
Center of Islamic radicalism,

5
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:28,990
the hiding place of his.
I'm a bit and the only us ally,

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,450
which Washington regularly bombs.

7
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,000
At least the drones do not kill British 
and US servicemen.

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,310
We will never leave Pakistan because 
Pakistan is part of Britain,

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,440
India and Pakistan and I'm glad they are
bone or the same room,

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,360
but it was more than that,
but it was just a Zambian section.

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,543
Einstein defined madness is doing the 
same thing over and over again and 

12
00:00:57,581 --> 00:01:00,070
expecting a different result.
This is madness.

13
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,680
Of course.
I'm representative.

14
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:03,514
I mean what makes me unrepresentative 
just because I speak English this 

15
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,520
evening.
I'll have a conversation with you if you

16
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:12,200
want later on.
That makes me more sensitive.
