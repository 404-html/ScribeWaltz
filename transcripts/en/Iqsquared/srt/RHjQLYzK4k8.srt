00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,040
One of the reasons for the current 
reemergence of frozen sniffed,

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,203
so to speak,
is that sniffed potentially a together 

3
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:15,411
with international companies could,
as I said,

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,220
this place Gazprom troll.
So I think just focusing on gas from.

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,260
It's not really,
it's not really entirely accurate.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,540
I think you should look at when we're 
talking about this,

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,633
these issues,
we need to look at what the independent 

8
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:35,940
producers can do and can deliver.
And again,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,740
which volumes we're talking about how 
much,

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,633
how much,
uh,

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,080
you know,
for us at the moment,

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,440
I think the key dilemmas to retain his 
role in,

13
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:44,880
in European markets potentially maybe 
increase it slightly.
