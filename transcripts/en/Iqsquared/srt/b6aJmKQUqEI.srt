1
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,700
There is a fundamental anthropologic 
will need for physical shopping.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So I don't think the high street is 
going anywhere anytime soon,

3
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,823
but I think shopping has evolved over 
the years and it will continue to 

4
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:30,260
evolve.
Technology does represent,

5
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:34,140
I think a chance for a fundamental 
change in the nature of the high street.

6
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,050
We all seen dramatic change in high 
streets in town centers.

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,800
That means they are never ever going to 
be the way they,

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,450
that will always be the bookies and the 
charity shops,

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,790
um,
under greg's on high street.

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,653
But I think,
yeah,

11
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,440
most of us that have that traditional 
retailers will migrate online.

12
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,530
We're definitely not saying that.
I think the high street,

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,573
I don't think anyway,
I think there's a place to have online 

14
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:04,640
shopping and the high street for 
anything,

15
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:07,010
electronics or something like that.
I'll buy it online,

16
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,883
but for some things,
maybe not just makeup and perfume and 

17
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:10,220
that kind of thing.

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,053
Again,
I think you want to go and see if it 

19
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:13,580
works with your skin or that kind of 
side of things.

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,473
For me,
it's the convenience of being at my 

21
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:20,060
house or my office and seeing literally 
everything at the world available for me

22
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:20,894
to look up to.
Many of these debates are around the 

23
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:23,564
idea of the high street as this really 
nostalgic view of the single 

24
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:28,574
thoroughfare that families would go to 
on a Saturday afternoon and do all of 

25
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:36,551
that shopping and that genuinely doesn't
reflect the state of the world.

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,430
I think it depends what you mean by the 
high streets.

27
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,363
I mean a physical straight down the 
middle of a town potentially is under 

28
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,850
massive threat,
but physical retail,

29
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:48,684
I don't think we're going to see the 
test of it at all and also in that role 

30
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:51,750
still be in the middle of town.

31
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,453
I think you've raised some really 
interesting points and now jump up 

32
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,363
farther and do further research or no,
I thought it was a really good opening 

33
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:12,250
to the discussion.
It was very interesting.

34
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:17,251
It's very controversial at times.
I thought more boring for discussion and

35
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:18,934
divide.
It got me thinking with you about a few 

36
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:23,740
other things that I thought were maybe 
not employed right now or not.

37
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:24,860
Kind of talk,
talk to me about,

38
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,800
and we're thinking about Ebay is a,
as a store I think is,

39
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,670
you know,
is,

40
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,370
um,
you know,

41
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,850
good as a,
uh,

42
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,200
as an online entity in itself,
but also works well with offline.

43
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:40,630
Some of the offerings that we have,
like our relationship with our gos,

44
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:44,220
which reinforces the High Street and 
gives people an extra option that,

45
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,290
uh,
kind of positively influences the,

46
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,170
um,
uh,

47
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,023
the high street.
So I,

48
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,080
I think the high street is just in a 
period of rebirth rather than,

49
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,640
uh,
rather than any demise.
