1
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:08,923
Square

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,740
in 1993,
Boutros Boutros Oh,

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,450
could also be called Boutros.
Boutros Boutros rally.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,713
He,
he was secretary general of United 

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,050
Nations and eminent French defied the 
option who in 1993 he said,

6
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:28,344
well,
it says we have to have democracy in 

7
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:34,620
Somalia for which we will have to build 
the economy,

8
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:36,630
rebuild the economy.
We want to have to build.

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,120
The political institutions will have to 
brill,

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,550
build a democratic state,
will have to build the court system left

11
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:43,920
to do this,
and you have to do that.

12
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:48,921
And the other.
Now that seems like a completely lunatic

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,513
program,
you're going to go to a place like 

14
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,430
Somalia.
You're going to build these things,

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,710
but reflect Boutros,
Boutros,

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,573
Boutros.
Ghali came from Egypt and in Egypt they 

17
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:04,401
have parliament that courts,
they have all of these things coexisting

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,600
with an undiminished dictatorship.
So for embroiders galleys idea,

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,040
you just go and set up.

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,890
You'll get a building and you call it 
the parliament building.

21
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,203
You create another,
another building called the electoral 

22
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:19,380
commission,
and then you have.

23
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,840
You will summon different people and 
say,

24
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:22,674
you're going to organize the Democratic 
Party and you're going to organize the 

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,470
central party and you're going to 
organize the patriotic party.

26
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:29,304
You better be smart about that,
and so that was the idea of creating 

27
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:33,744
democracy for the secretary general of 
United Nations in 1993 was something 

28
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:41,790
that was very straightforward because 
you had the Egyptian case,

29
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,000
a great warning there in the case of 
Egypt,

30
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:45,834
because you'll have all the forms,
the externally created externally 

31
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:50,934
induced forms which actually provide 
extremely comfortable framework for a 

32
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,174
dictatorship.

33
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,620
If you believe that the unity of the 
humanity is broken,

34
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,030
that it is separated into humanities,
like specialists and different space,

35
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:11,950
yes,
then you are completely disarmed.

36
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,263
You have no weapon and no tool to 
protest or to react to a flagrant 

37
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,893
injustice,
a bloodbath or gen site in the name of 

38
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,444
what should you react to the genocide in
Rwanda or to the beginning of genocide 

39
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,773
in Darfur.
If you don't believe that democracy is 

40
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,390
for everyone,
if you believe like,

41
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,753
hey girl and Spangler,
that humanity in divided into different 

42
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:49,321
spaces and so on and so that's why.
If you oppose the motion,

43
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,923
it is not because I believe that we 
shall build all of a sudden tomorrow 

44
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:03,271
morning a fake British parliamentary 
democracy in the disaster,

45
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,210
the inhabited areas of dark pool,
which I visited a few weeks ago.

46
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,713
Of course not in these parts of Africa 
where the human cleansing has been 

47
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,384
nearly achieved.
Of course windows have them ocracy 

48
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:20,883
coming from from the soil,
but believing that democracy is for 

49
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,690
everyone just means that you have 
enhance some tools,

50
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,980
some arguments,
some worlds,

51
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,040
some values which are low you to condemn
what is happening.

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
For example,
in doctoral.
