1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,730
My default position of failure and still
to be achieved,

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,953
uh,
ideas is the man who killed Dongey Hood 

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,463
Hoodie.
That's just keeps coming up again and 

4
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:16,320
again and it keeps crashing.
So it's the Sisyphean moment of my life,

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,130
whether I really shouldn't be 
continuing,

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,400
even trying to do it,
I don't know.

7
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:22,170
My wife says,
walk away from it.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,390
The problem is once you start trying to 
make quixote in any form,

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,553
you become Kioti and you're trapped and 
the endless dream and reality collision 

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,640
that is your life.
