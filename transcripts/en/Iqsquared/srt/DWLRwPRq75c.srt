1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,590
The trump supporters,
I'm a resistance to judging trump on his

2
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,770
merits,
of which there are none,

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,663
you know,
uh,

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,970
comes down in part to this with this 
loop,

5
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:17,250
back to that rebellion against the 
elites.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,040
Now,
one of the things that,

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,140
there has been tremendous scorn for and 
fun made of trump and in deed deed trump

8
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:30,924
supporters in when you are angry at the 
establishment and you see the 

9
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:36,504
establishment and not,
not just disagreeing with your 

10
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:42,420
candidate,
but mocking or candidate.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,810
There is an element of this is they're 
mocking me.

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:46,973
They're mocking me.
All these people at the New York Times 

13
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:51,330
going on and on about how does this is 
impossible.

14
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:54,780
This horrible person cannot possibly be 
president too.

15
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,920
They're saying that I am so,
you know,

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,040
because I support him,
you know,

17
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,983
they're looking down on me.
It's all these fancy college educated 

18
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:06,630
people and I'm the one doing the hard 
work,

19
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:06,840
you know?

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,673
And they're looking down at me.
And so there was almost every time you 

21
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,654
went out to make fun of trump,
you increased to support because people 

22
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:18,720
were feeling scorned.
You know,

23
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:19,141
when,
when,

24
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:21,870
when people feel that they are 
outsiders,

25
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:22,704
you cannot convince them by mocking them
and you can't convince them by mocking 

26
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,990
their position,
the he,

27
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:31,963
we had to either wait for what seems I 
hope to have happen for the guy's head 

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,410
explode,
you know,

29
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,770
or we had to take,
you know,

30
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,730
some sort of other approach to,
to,

31
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,470
to this and say,
well,

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,041
you know,
let's,

33
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,010
let's look at it from this angle.
Or you know,

34
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,933
maybe this is a good reason to vote for 
the Libertarian party or maybe it 

35
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,490
anyway.
The scorn does not.

36
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,100
When,
when people feel scorned to heap,

37
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:02,040
scorn upon them isn't going to work.
