1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,880
What I'm going to be talking about 
tonight is the optimistic view,

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,330
which I take of the future of economic 
future of this country in the world.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,920
I don't think innovation is exhausted by
any means.

4
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:21,420
I'm not sure how he would know what the 
future of innovation is,

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,090
but I don't think it's exhausted.
But I,

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,983
but I,
I think my main point is that the world 

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,510
is,
is developing.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,613
The whole world is becoming richer.
We are in a period of the fastest world 

9
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:42,741
growth and income per head in history.
And when China and India and sub Saharan

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,863
Africa and Latin America come online,
we're going to have in the next 50 or a 

11
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:54,180
hundred years a world cultural,
economic.

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,160
It can,
um,

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,170
uh,
sports,

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,733
uh,
intellectual explosion such as you have 

15
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:02,334
never seen.
