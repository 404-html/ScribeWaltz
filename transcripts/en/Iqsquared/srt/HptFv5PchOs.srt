00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,490
Can I just answer one point about doing 
more for the poor?

2
00:00:03,491 --> 00:00:05,200
Of course we should do more for the 
book,

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,123
but why do we assume that it's either 
you deal with climate change or you do 

4
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:12,100
something for the poor?
First of all,

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,053
climate change,
it's actually they had most of its 

6
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:15,274
effects in the developing countries and 
you can increase double or triple the 

7
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:20,440
amount of aid.
It will still,

8
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:22,780
because of climate change produced 
malnutrition,

9
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:25,180
increasing hunger,
it will certainly,

10
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,780
uh,
data produced more flooding.

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,400
Uh,
it'll produce,

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,010
uh,
the damage to crops.

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,680
Um,
it'll produce unclean water.

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,470
It'll increase dysentery.
I mean,

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,510
it's not a one or the other.
If you deal with climate change,

16
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:41,680
we're doing a lot for the poor.
