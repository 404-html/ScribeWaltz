1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,600
So what is the great challenge or 
question before us?

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,220
I think of it as the wall within each 
one of us.

3
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:09,630
The war between apathy and action.
Apathy is very seductive.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,943
It is wreathed in false facts.
Facts such as there is no progress in 

5
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:16,500
Africa.
There is no progress anywhere.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,250
The is,
um,

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,133
no.
All African leaders are corrupt and all 

8
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,810
aid is wasted.
These are holes,

9
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:23,110
facts,
the datasets.

10
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,103
D datasets do not exist to justify them 
yet they bounce around unscrutinised 

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,210
they need to be challenged because 
they're wrong.

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,590
Against that is the call to action.
Not just mindless action,

13
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:35,424
but evidence based action or factor in 
some call it and that's a growing 

14
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:40,404
movement of informed global citizens.
You take action based on the facts to 

15
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,144
change government policies or make 
informed consumer decisions that result 

16
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:54,450
in building on facts of progress.
Facts such as we have in fact hearth,

17
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:55,284
extreme poverty.

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,160
There are now 9 million people on 
antiretroviral drugs funded by you.

19
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,743
You didn't know that,
that you're saving these lives through 

20
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:03,420
funding these drugs.
Thank you.

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,303
Malaria deaths,
deaths down because of insecticide 

22
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:08,760
treated bed nets,
again,

23
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:11,850
funded by taxpayer funded eight 
programs,

24
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:12,684
a smart aid programs,
and above all progress generated by 

25
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:16,824
great leadership in Africa by some 
governments in a bubble by citizens in 

26
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:21,084
these countries and across the 
developing world who are demanding 

27
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,083
better results.
The chance we have now is through the 

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,553
Millennium Goals renewed to build on the
fact of progress armed citizens across 

29
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:33,414
the world with scorecards to measure 
governments and they're holding them 

30
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:38,694
accountable.
That is the great prize we have before 

31
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:43,370
us to generate this army of,
uh,

32
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,363
informed global citizens who will build 
on the facts of progress and avoid 

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,350
terrible facts that could exist by 2030.
If we don't get this right,

34
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,930
to which world you want and which set of
facts do you want to live in by 2030.

35
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,293
Thank you.
