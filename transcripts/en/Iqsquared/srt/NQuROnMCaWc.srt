1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,953
I don't feel I have a very high heavy 
burden since I have Jack and con on my 

2
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:13,600
side,
but it's also a great pleasure to appear

3
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:16,800
with such worthy adversaries if I can.
If I can,

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,300
I use that term in the age of Obama.
Maybe partners,

5
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:20,134
I should say.
I very much hope the president changes 

6
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,610
his,
his foreign policy,

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,950
but for now I'm afraid it's a failure.

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,600
How can you talk about the unsafe?
Well,

9
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:31,500
now,
wow.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,380
If God forbid something had happened to 
John Mccain,

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,570
we'd have President Pailin.
Boy,

12
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,350
we'd all sleep safely and our bands 
wouldn't it.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,720
The greatest gift to the animism.
Erica was the eight.

14
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:47,100
Yeah.
Fiasco.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,370
A masterpiece of ineptitude,
calamity,

16
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:51,204
and arrogance.
That was the administration of George W 

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,783
Bush

18
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,180
standing on a stage here when encourages
theatrical performances.

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,300
We just got one and I'm the more 
serious.

20
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:06,091
Got It.
All right.

21
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:08,270
I'm going to.
I'm a military guy.

22
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:09,104
I'm pretty serious.
I'm going to deal with facts and less 

23
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:11,870
with the metrics.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,753
My feeling,
my belief is that President Obama is 

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,390
early Chinese.
I vote no against a reasonably shun it.

26
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,070
I think that Barack Obama is not a gift 
to our enemies,

27
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,190
but is a two hour the and the most 
efficient of it,

28
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:44,300
most efficient for poisons,
which are the Chinese boy zones.

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,690
I think Barack Obama,
among his many gifts,

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,250
has the intellectual and moral force to 
look at this new map.

31
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,143
Clearly it is one in which we cannot 
isolate strategic problems from legal 

32
00:01:58,641 --> 00:01:59,474
problems.

33
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,910
I just like to address my former tutor,
Simon Schama.

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,013
I often found the,
his tour de force in the tutorial is 

35
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:12,120
rather than using as I did today,
my dear my dear former professor,

36
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,730
um,
failed to address the motion here.

37
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,400
This motion is about Obama's foreign 
policy,

38
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:21,330
not how much we detest George Bush or 
share a painter

39
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,260
thing about thinking about student calm.
Was He always had,

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,101
you know,
he was saying,

41
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:26,934
I'm going to give you the facts,
which actually meant I haven't actually 

42
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:29,910
read the assignment.

43
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,093
No.
Actually,

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,850
when I ever get the facts right,

45
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,960
Bush may have been heavy handed and the 
way he spoke for democracy,

46
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,400
but at least he spoke to democracy.

47
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,020
He has the same enemies as the previous 
administrations,

48
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,260
but that he deals with these enemies in 
a way more wise and we mall.

49
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,123
I said poison,
let's say with more boys than his 

50
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,500
predecessor was.
Thank you.

51
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,183
You.
