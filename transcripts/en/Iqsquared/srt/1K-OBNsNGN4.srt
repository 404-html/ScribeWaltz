1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,450
What concerns me at the moment is 
something much more basic,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,313
much more fundamental,
and much more closely related to the 

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:09,940
core of Magna Carta.
What I,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:10,883
what I said a little bit earlier was 
that one of the fundamental points that 

5
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:17,850
comes out of Magna Carta is the idea 
that you have to have access to justice.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,820
That if you can't enforce your rights in
a court,

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,730
you have no rights.
And in that sense,

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:24,763
David Wright,
that universal human rights are gfe if 

9
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:27,564
they can't be enforced.
And that's why what interests me is not 

10
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:31,134
so much universal human rights but 
British civil liberties that can be 

11
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:35,664
enforced in our courts.
And what concerns me at the moment is 

12
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:40,554
that this government is conducting a 
sustained an ideological attack on 

13
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:51,591
access to court and it is parsing almost
without notice in the national media.

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,190
I want to give three examples of it.
First of all,

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,100
uh,
the so called reforms to legal aid.

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,953
Secondly,
the proposals made two weeks ago 

17
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,070
massively to increase court fees which 
are passed almost without comment.

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,863
And thirdly,
the new legislation which will restrict 

19
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:18,530
access to judicial review.
Firstly,

20
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,480
in relation to legal aid,
as many of you will know,

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,860
uh,
two years ago,

22
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,450
the government,
uh,

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,020
removed legal aid for most forms of 
civil litigation,

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,350
a whole areas where previously legal aid
had been available.

25
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:32,184
It was removed from including almost all
family law cases except where there's 

26
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,983
recent evidence of domestic abuse.
This has resulted in a far greater 

27
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:43,974
numbers of cases where people are 
litigants in person cases taking much 

28
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:50,880
longer and appalling situations arising 
in court.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,953
A situation a few weeks ago where a 
father was seeking access to a child 

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,943
where the mother said that he had 
sexually abused the child where because 

31
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:05,004
no legal aid was available,
the judge was contemplating a situation 

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,233
where the father would have to cross 
examine his own child on the truth of 

33
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,100
the mother's allegation that he had 
abused that child,

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,813
that that's an intolerable situation to 
have in any court and it is the direct 

35
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:23,790
result of government policy.

36
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,743
And the Lord Chancellor Christopher 
grayling sent leading council into that 

37
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,064
court to argue that it was the farthest 
choice to be unrepresented because he 

38
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:36,840
had the disposable income of 10,000 
pounds a year.

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,810
I'm not making this up.
It happened.

40
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,003
So that's the first thing.
Legal Aid and the Public Accounts 

41
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,010
Committee yesterday,
uh,

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,390
produced a report in which they pointed 
out that the Ministry of Justice,

43
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:49,224
it introduced these reforms without 
first taking the trouble to work out 

44
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,154
whether the money they would save would 
in fact be saved or whether they would 

45
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:57,654
simply be not con costs in other 
departments because of the physical and 

46
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:01,924
mental harm done to people who would no 
longer be able to get access to legal 

47
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:05,644
advice.
And the comment of the Public Accounts 

48
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,703
Committee at a,
a cross a party committee was that the 

49
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,933
Ministry of Justice now has no idea 
whether it's actually saved any money 

50
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:16,114
from these reforms.
