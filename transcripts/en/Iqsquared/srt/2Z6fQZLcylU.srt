1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,870
Internet,
Savior or destroyer that neither.

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,530
I don't think it's going to make any 
significant difference.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,320
Don remitting only interested in the 
message.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,160
I am prodigious Lee uninterested in the 
medium.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,380
The Internet is just another way of 
writing things down.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,850
Citizen Journalism.
And it sounds so wonderful.

7
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:31,680
It sounds like something from the French
Revolution,

8
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:33,540
isn't it?
Um,

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,020
do you want a citizen dentist?
Our media,

10
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:39,854
our publications at the moment are a 
wash with highly paid columnist who by 

11
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,290
and large have nothing to say.
Uh,

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,310
no.
Very little.

13
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,080
Yep.

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,080
Four of the largest of the top 10 new 
sites on the way are aggregators.

15
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:55,390
Google,
AOL,

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,710
Yahoo,
Microsoft.

17
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,640
They don't generate news.
They collect other people's news.

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,240
Rupert Murdoch has now declared war on 
Google.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,850
It's not Google's fault that everyone 
was so stupid.

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,053
Ah,
and he is going to progressively put 

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,890
more and more of his content behind what
we call a pay wall.

22
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,910
And I welcome that.
And I hope a lot of other proprietors,

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,953
we'll do the same.

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,893
The big get bigger in,
in these kind of perpetual declines and 

25
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:24,310
obviously the smaller quality,
uh,

26
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,310
titles are the ones that have a greater 
trouble hanging on.

27
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,210
There's always some financial basis for 
this work.

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,073
It's not free.
And the reason is it takes an enormous 

29
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:37,430
amount of time to produce very good 
content and money.

30
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,283
If you look at the comments at the 
bottom of articles on newspaper 

31
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:44,900
websites,
they are awesome.

32
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,500
I mean they are properly knuckle 
dragging.

33
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,070
Most of the stuff that comes on chat 
rooms and on blogs,

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,310
it's beyond corporate and Sinead is 
idiocy.

35
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,973
You,
you or relate to the reader in a 

36
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:05,340
fundamentally different way.
When I used to write for magazines,

37
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,510
you would publish your article and maybe
some letters that would come in the mail

38
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:10,344
a week later,
by which point you'd totally moved on 

39
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:12,894
and forgotten about the subject.
And of course most people didn't bother 

40
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:16,320
to write it all.
Now,

41
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:18,890
within an hour of anything I publish on 
slate.

42
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,783
Uh,
there are hundreds of comments and now 

43
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:24,390
that we've sort of gotten better at 
figuring out how to do comments,

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,710
it's quite a good conversation that I 
participate in and I depend on that.

45
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:29,544
I don't,
I don't write to speak from on high to 

46
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:32,670
an invisible audience.

47
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,460
I write to relate to an audience of 
people,

48
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,323
many of whom I start to know and 
recognize because they're so responsive 

49
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,140
to what I do.
There's reviews on the Nasher incredibly

50
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:45,810
successful.
Lots of people follow them.

51
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,530
Most of them are written by theater 
producers.

52
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,510
Why wouldn't they be?
You think someone's going to say,

53
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:57,810
I can't do that because I put money into
the production.

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,660
The question about news generation on a 
thin news day,

55
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,700
do we make it up?
No,

56
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,880
we don't make it up.
We,

57
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,240
we eke it out.
We can put up and we,

58
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,083
we look at on that,
we spin it out and we generally sort of 

59
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,190
stuff it forward a little bit,
but we don't absolutely make it up.
