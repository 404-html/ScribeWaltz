1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,003
The green agenda if pressed in 
competently in political terms with the 

2
00:00:04,581 --> 00:00:06,770
wrong compelling messages,
uh,

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,210
imposed on people in the wrong ways will
actually delay the green revolution.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,523
The,
and we've just had a perfect example 

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,410
here,
but people are saying,

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,453
oh,
we must be very careful about gas 

7
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:18,880
expansion and,
uh,

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,470
we've done to shale gas,
America's fine,

9
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:24,620
but we didn't want to see too much 
encouragement here.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,753
What is the net effect of that?
The net effect is that American code is 

11
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:28,994
pouring into Europe.
We're burning more color here in this 

12
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:31,604
country.
Europe's code as a whole is increasing 

13
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:34,814
the actual Germans or planning new coal 
fired stations where s and m c o to 

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,590
welland forming,
falling to America to the 20th,

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,960
20 year level,
lowest level,

16
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,323
uh,
and the foreign 14% in the last two 

17
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:48,854
years.
And the per capita emissions has fallen 

18
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:54,270
dramatically.
So it's not just a recession issue.

19
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,203
Well,
I mean,

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,850
because you have chosen a quite a two 
year horizon in a time of low us grace.

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,720
Can I call you on that?

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,611
Well,
you can call me,

23
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:07,470
but the 57 million extra people in 
America in the last 20 years,

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,240
and yet the carbon co two emissions up 
now 20% down,

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,113
they are very loud.
