1
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,363
Well,
good evening ladies and gentlemen and 

2
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:24,470
welcome to the meet in the middle of the
sandwich.

3
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,233
My first thing is to say,
please turn off your mobile phones 

4
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:33,131
because it was always someone who 
forgets we get a bit of old or Beethoven

5
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:35,180
or they're not hearing tune.
It's very distracting.

6
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,403
Secondly,
make sure you don't lose these in the 

7
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:41,420
course of the debate because you're 
going to need them to vote at the end,

8
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,170
nor should you tear them in half because
if you are going to vote,

9
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,004
don't know.
You need to put those in together or 

10
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,693
looking forward to a very lively 
interchange from the between the panel 

11
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:53,864
on the floor,
so sharpen your wits and make notes of 

12
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:57,524
anything you find that is either 
particularly excellent you want to 

13
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:03,320
amplify or particularly annoying that 
you want to rebut.

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,650
Your time will come.
You can read,

15
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,731
not going to say,
well,

16
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:09,200
that was a consequence of the empire or 
not.

17
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,490
You're going to read so I'm not going to
give very long biographies.

18
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,910
I should just introduce the speakers.
I'm very briefly,

19
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:21,560
but I would urge you please to buy all 
the books on sale outside.

20
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:24,680
They all make ideal Christmas presents 
and um,

21
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:25,514
it's the best.
The nicest thing for the speaker after 

22
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,010
the emotion,
even if they haven't,

23
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:30,320
one,
is to be besieged by people saying,

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,450
please can you sign this copy of the 
book or even better copies of the book.

25
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,590
The emotion,
um,

26
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,910
is Britain's former colonies should stop
blaming the empire for their ills.

27
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,270
And one can debate that a little bit in 
terms of the terms.

28
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:52,271
What exactly do we mean by our colony is
a Scotland commonly is arland economy is

29
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,283
corn will accompany.
France might used to be British at one 

30
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:57,500
point,
or at least bits of it.
