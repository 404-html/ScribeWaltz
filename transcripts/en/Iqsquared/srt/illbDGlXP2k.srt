00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,563
Quite often when you hear therapists 
talking about people going through the 

2
00:00:06,231 --> 00:00:09,890
grieving process,
they say that there's a the anger stage,

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,680
the denial stage,
the depression stage,

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,650
the bargaining stage,
and finally the acceptance stage.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,083
Most people in this country voted to 
leave the EU and I think some of the 

6
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:23,840
remainers are still at the anger and 
denial stage.

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,400
There is a very clear set of ideas as to
what we do next.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,833
The good Lord may not like them,
but I think there are perfectly good 

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,120
arguments in that document which I'd be 
happy to send you to explain or teachers

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,610
we can do next.
Douglas,

11
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:41,444
can I say that this argument about 
bereavement is one of the most patched 

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,273
realizing

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,360
statements I have ever [inaudible] about
this 52

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,490
you just said we have democracy where 
you accept that that is a process.

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,930
You accept that that means that when it 
goes against you,

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,530
you do not start refusing to pay your 
taxes.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,880
You do not have a right to violence or 
other than unpeaceful demonstrations,

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,180
but on the day after a Labor government 
is elected,

19
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,330
Tory party activists and and ps decide 
the very next day that their main aim in

20
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:26,064
life is to make sure that at least 
within five years that is reversed and 

21
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:31,014
the idea that they should go into 
parliament and vote with the Labor 

22
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:37,560
government because that is accepting the
will of the people is absurd.

23
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,603
I completely accept as a given fact,
we are going to leave the European good 

24
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:44,370
of you.
Youtube,

25
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,203
I am complete with that.
We are going to lead well when you say 

26
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:49,164
it's good to you except that supplies 
and I wasn't [inaudible] that we 

27
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:52,830
shouldn't accept it.

28
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,460
What leads seem to suggest that we 
shouldn't accept it.

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,590
What I am suggesting is that it occurred
over the next year that there was a turn

30
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:02,304
of events by which on February the 21st 
next year we had a referendum that went 

31
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:08,994
52 to 48% the other way that would be 
equally legitimate as the one that went 

32
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,920
52 to 48 they say,
can referee.

33
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:17,750
I look,
oh,

34
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,940
you think there is almost no chance of 
that occurring,

35
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,880
but to suggest that it's somehow 
illegitimate,

36
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,773
an undemocratic for some people to want 
that suggest that he's only really 

37
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:29,610
understand democracy having

38
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,910
okay elected.

39
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,920
They're not because I've been appointed 
that voted for the government in power.

40
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:41,080
Whichever it was.
Did you,

41
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,290
that was your interpretation of 
parliament through the ballot box?

42
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,670
My Lord,
not for appointment.

43
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,200
Okay,
let me bring in other people.

44
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,510
Let me bring in other people.
You'll have a chance to come back.
