1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,433
Should we actually be having in our mind
the idea of promoting democracy and not 

2
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,440
necessarily by offering false promises 
to the people,

3
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:28,030
but by taking on those who are thwarting
it or should or is it,

4
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,613
is it appropriate for us instead to 
concentrate on very important point of 

5
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,760
securing oil,
keeping friendly with those who can give

6
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:42,040
the oil on which our economy depends.
In other words,

7
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,180
have we got our ideals in the wrong 
order?

8
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,403
Do you have a position on whether or not
we should actually possibly jeopardize 

9
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:57,730
our economic health in favor of the idea
of pushing the democracy notion?

10
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:58,470
Okay.

11
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,430
This is a really good question because 
it shows what the whole problem,

12
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,120
the whole problem is that we have 
created a black and white world in which

13
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:11,121
we imagined that we have to choose all 
the time either by being Dick Cheney and

14
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:12,114
focused on oil and oppression and 
plotting up desk bots or on the other 

15
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:16,494
hand Amnesty International with 
absolutely no contact with the world at 

16
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:21,720
all.
This is not,

17
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,140
this is not the choice that we face.
This is not what our diplomats are there

18
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:30,660
to do.
That's not what our international policy

19
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:31,494
is about.
We need to discover how to be 

20
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:37,530
pragmatically moral,
how to be passionately moderate,

21
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,663
how to combine our moral instincts with 
our interests and being realistic about 

22
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:43,464
what we can and can't do.
The reason we let people down all the 

23
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:47,220
time,
the reason we invade these countries and

24
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:49,260
create a mess,
the reason we're probably going to do it

25
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:50,094
again for the next 15 years is we have 
never managed to get a mature 

26
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,114
conversation going about what we're 
actually doing and what we can do in 

27
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:58,674
these countries were not able to 
understand firstly that these countries 

28
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:02,964
are not our countries,
that these countries do have a claim of 

29
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,750
sovereignty,
that they have their own cultures,

30
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:10,584
their own languages,
and they don't really like foreigners 

31
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:16,530
being in them and that therefore what we
do with other people's countries,

32
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:17,364
a bit like what I would do with you if 
you were my friend has to be limited by 

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,920
respect for other people's autonomy and 
other people's choice and cannot involve

34
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:28,470
an endless oscillation between black and
white.

35
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,860
Assuming that the only choices we face 
are either oil,

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,700
well,
the most pure conception of our in moral

37
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,534
GC.
