Philosophers love the burning building 
scenario,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,280
so you've got two rooms,
the building is burning and you can save

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,400
either the thing in one room or the 
thing in the other,

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,263
and that's the choice that you have.
So imagine there's a child in one room 

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,760
and there's a Picasso in the other.
The building is burning.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,223
Now,
the effective altruist could argue that 

7
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:31,591
you can sell up a casio for many 
millions and with those millions,

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,630
give that money to charity to a malaria 
net charity,

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,930
which will then save a great many on a 
cost benefit analysis will say,

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,610
have a great many more children.
Okay,

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,623
so the effective altruism faced with a 
burning Picasso and a burning child 

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,910
might save the Burning Picasso.
Now this point,

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,013
my sympathy for effective altruists just
disappears and it disappears because I 

14
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,530
think there really is something that is 
not factored in here,

15
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:10,180
which is the emotional sympathy,
which is absolutely essential,

16
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:15,181
which you have done everything you can 
to eliminate from our calculations,

17
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,370
but I would call the person and when we 
disagree about this,

18
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:21,670
I mean I think the technical term for 
the person that saves the Picasso,

19
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,410
and I think this would be a sort of.

20
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,960
I think publicly I would get a lot of 
support for this.

21
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:26,883
Maybe not here,
but out there that the technical term 

22
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,973
for the person that saves the Picasso 
over the burning child is a heartless 

23
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:33,934
bastard.
