1
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,880
But a very,
very good evening to you,

2
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:19,714
delighted to have professor Stiglitz 
with us and it's fantastic that 

3
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,340
economics can put in such a big crowd.
Um,

4
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,620
British economist,
a pretty good,

5
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,000
uh,
by global standards,

6
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:33,220
American economists to somehow more 
interesting.

7
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:34,054
I always tend to think they,
they have a tradition of saying things 

8
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:37,444
that people can understand writing in 
newspapers being polemical and 

9
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:41,920
political,
uh,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and also winning Nobel prizes.
Joe Stiglitz is in this tradition.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,380
He's written this book,
the latest of his books,

12
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:52,450
highly readable,
uh,

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,400
available,
uh,

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,870
from the foyer I should say.
Um,

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,010
but he's also worked in the real world.
Well,

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,790
the sort of real worlds,
the World Bank,

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,290
the Clinton administration.
Um,

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,773
but he's achieved top academic 
distinction with a Nobel prize which he 

19
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:12,841
got with several others for spotting 
something quite important in economics.

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,193
Um,
and indeed in life that information is 

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,603
extremely important and that markets 
don't always work well when information 

22
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,240
is unequally distributed.

23
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,950
If a lender doesn't know how reliable 
that borrower is,

24
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,970
the market for loans may not work well.
Now,

25
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:36,520
that's something that might perhaps 
sound a bit obvious now,

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,473
but the arguments are quite subtle.
It's around the fact that if bad 

27
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:43,990
borrowers are the ones who have an 
inclination to borrow because they don't

28
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,933
tend to pay the loans back,
the whole market for loans can be 

29
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:48,964
screwed up and it's similar.
Arguments have been applied to 

30
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:51,364
secondhand cars.
Similar arguments apply in the labor 

31
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:59,071
market to those arguments.
They reshaped economics in the 1970s and

32
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:00,544
eighties and Joe Stiglitz is one of the 
three men who gained recognition for 

33
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:05,164
them at the moment.
He's a professor at the Columbia 

34
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,553
Business School in New York.
He also chairs the Brooks World Poverty 

35
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,070
Institute at the University of 
Manchester.

36
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,730
Uh,
so good academic good policy maker.

37
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:17,410
Now I don't want to put British 
economist is down.

38
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:20,920
We did have the greatest the world has 
ever seen in John Maynard Keynes,

39
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,143
but the Americans,
I'm afraid even how the most fluent 

40
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:28,390
followers of Keynes these days,
and Joseph Stiglitz is one of those like

41
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,790
a formed a format for tonight's going to
be very simple.

42
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,220
He's going to speak for up to 15 
minutes.

43
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:34,930
At that point,
I will stop him,

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,570
whatever he's saying.
Um,

45
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,730
I will talk to him a little bit up here.
We'll have some conversation up here and

46
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:45,340
then we will take questions from the 
floor,

47
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:48,490
but let's get straight on and welcome 
professor Joseph stickler.

48
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,910
[inaudible].
