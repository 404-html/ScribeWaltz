1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,170
The Millennium Development Goals,
Gavin,

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:07,180
I support for poverty reduction
today,

3
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:08,584
the target of housing,
the number of people living in extreme 

4
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:14,350
poverty has been met.
Progress has been uneven

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,843
as the United Nations and its partners 
shape a new global framework to replace 

6
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:20,774
the mdgs in 2015.
They faced the challenge of ending 

7
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:25,334
poverty for good,
which means tackling some important 

8
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:30,950
questions.
What is poverty?

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,283
How is it measured?
Poverty is not only the income and poor 

10
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,340
people do not live only in poor 
countries

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,213
today,
a new bottom billion live in middle 

12
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,690
income countries,
including India and China.

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,590
It's also not just a question of getting
to zero,

14
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:52,963
but staying there.
Then there's the issue of where to fix 

15
00:00:57,351 --> 00:00:58,184
the new development goal posts to 
recapture the Millennium Declarations 

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,240
vision.
The new international development agenda

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,360
must embody principles of solidarity,
equality,

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:13,400
dignity and respect for nature.
Finally,

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,360
once these goals have been agreed,
how will they be achieved?

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,353
We'll need new policies and leadership 
by national governments and the global 

21
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:26,140
community,
but what else?

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,290
On the fifth of December,
2013,

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,423
we debated these questions and others 
with the panel of world experts kick 

24
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:37,860
here to watch the arguments.
