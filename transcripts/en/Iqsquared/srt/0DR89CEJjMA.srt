1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,470
The right rises,
the hard revolting rate rises.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,043
It feeds off immigration,
but it rises when those decent 

3
00:00:07,211 --> 00:00:10,330
politicians on the right give it room to
rise and doesn't fight it.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,703
I watched Marine Le Pen rise and it was 
when the conventional parties in France 

5
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:18,730
bent towards her and the advent of Ukip 
and its rise is because the conservative

6
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:19,564
party did the same thing and mark and 
Angela Merkel is an example of what you 

7
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:25,930
can do to lead a nation to another 
destination.

8
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:29,140
Churchill called us the Mongrel nation 
and so we are,

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,513
we are the product of succeeding waves 
of immigration into this country and it 

10
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:34,114
makes us what we are and this is the 
Mongrel city and it is the most 

11
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:41,590
successful global city in the world 
because of that place,

12
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:44,560
a barrier up to it as the gentleman over
here once and you remove that.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,753
I disagreed with the idea that it's only
Muslims who are responsible for 

14
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:50,224
overturning our values.
You've always been able to find 

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,700
gentleman over there was right young men
who will see,

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,210
who will think it is part of a noble 
calls to kill innocent people.

17
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,760
That was the anarchist at the turn of 
the 19th century.

18
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,740
It was the bottom line,
half guard gang.

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,753
It was the road facsia.
I don't have to go to Baghdad to hear a 

20
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:08,710
preacher preaching death row.
Put it.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,100
I can go to Belfast.
These have always been there,

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,910
and it is wrong of Malcolm Rifkind to 
ascribe this simply to Muslims.

23
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,970
These are people who wish to overturn 
the values,

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,893
who happened to be Muslims,
but we've had plenty of Christians 

25
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,440
seeking to do it.
Look,

26
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,303
we haven't got all the answers.
This is one of the really great 

27
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,450
conundrums,
challenges,

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,740
moral and practical to confront us.
I know some of the things we ought to be

29
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:33,574
doing or not doing,
but I haven't got a solution to all of 

30
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:36,520
these.
We're going to have to think,

31
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,223
but I'll tell you one thing.
If you do not do this on the basis of 

32
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:42,394
your humanity,
then you will be left with only one way 

33
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:49,000
to do it.
Moats and walls and barbed wire,

34
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,403
and then you lose your humanity and 
you'll create another reason for even 

35
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:53,644
more walls.

36
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,200
[inaudible].
