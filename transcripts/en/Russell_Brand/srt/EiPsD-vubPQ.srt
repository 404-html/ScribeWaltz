in a strange land encounters in the DC,

5
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:19,430
United States,
no place like home,

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,293
a black Britain's journey through the 
American south and his most recent 

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,353
another day in the death of America.
A harrowing account of children's lives 

8
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:32,900
cut short by the ubiquity of gun 
violence in the u s Gary,

9
00:00:32,901 --> 00:00:33,910
thanks for coming.
Thanks.

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,220
You've been really keen to get you here 
for a long time.

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,083
I particularly enjoy your journalism and
your commentary on the subject of 

12
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:44,300
violence.
What are you,

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,223
I mean,
we know that you're here to talk about 

14
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,890
another day in the death of America.
Where did you,

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,060
where the devices that just in one 24 
hour period you,

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,950
I suppose elevate the depths that take 
place on that day until their stories.

17
00:00:57,951 --> 00:00:59,990
Did you really just choose the day at 
random?

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,230
I did.
It was the first day I could do,

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,890
I've been in,
uh,

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,480
London promoting a previous book in 
October.

21
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,210
And then I came back,
I had a seven month old babies.

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,220
How did a little bit of work to do to 
get in the good graces of my family then

23
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:19,550
it was thanksgiving.
Um,

24
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,523
my family is American,
my wife is American and this was the 

25
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:25,880
first Saturday after thanksgiving.
So it was the,

26
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,110
it was literally the first challenge.
I mean,

27
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,320
what's awful about,
um,

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,000
shapes his book is the reliability of 
the statistic.

29
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,050
So every day in American seven kids on 
average a shot dad.

30
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,870
And that statistic is sufficiently 
reliable that so long as you're choosing

31
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,660
a weekend cause more do done at the 
weekend or in a,

32
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:55,730
and what more do die the weekend even 
more dire in the summer when kids around

33
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,620
and playing and all of that,
um,

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,170
that you could do any weekend.
It would,

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,033
it would work horrifically.
So you could in the most brutal 

36
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,363
manifestation of it,
you can sit down and wait for the kids 

37
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:12,640
to die.
They will donate.

38
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,950
It's reliable.
It's a perfectly reliable statistics.

39
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,780
I haven't seen the stance,
but I can almost guarantee you that last

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,433
weekend on average,
seven kids would have at least seven 

41
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:26,974
kids would've died on Saturday and 
Sunday and next weekend will be the 

42
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:30,470
same.

43
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,620
Why is he in particular about these 
deaths that goals you?

44
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,780
Why are you fascinated by this?

45
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,800
It's more that they all go me and that,
um,

46
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,020
if America pays attention when it's a 
mass shooting or some kind of spectacle,

47
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,900
not every time,
but most of the time,

48
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,873
but on a daily basis,
these deaths are just like the white 

49
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,480
noise around you that everybody gets on 
with.

50
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:00,970
And you do almost in year two,
it,

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,950
you know,
you're watching the TV and it's,

52
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,750
um,
after this,

53
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,910
well before the sport,
you know,

54
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,803
and on 68th and Harrison,
a 17 year old boy was shot dead last 

55
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:13,871
night when Blah,
blah,

56
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:14,704
blah.
And then this is a show of his mum 

57
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,110
crying,
saying [inaudible].

58
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,313
And um,
after a while that just becomes the way 

59
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:28,150
things are.
And um,

60
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,990
I do think in this center helping 
British and thinking,

61
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:32,824
well,
it doesn't have to be like that 

62
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,603
actually.
And so what I wanted to do with this 

63
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,930
random day was pick,
let the day pick the kids.

64
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,110
And then you know,
there are,

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,540
if you pick a different day,
you get a different book.

66
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,110
Um,
there are,

67
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,723
uh,
every,

68
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,430
twice a week a toddler either killed 
themselves or kill someone.

69
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,640
Um,
you know,

70
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,474
there are,
there would be other days it would be 

71
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:03,574
more compelling.
Maybe the order would produce more 

72
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:06,964
compelling stories.
But the point is this was like the day 

73
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,613
choose the kids and then I will follow 
them up and find out who they were 

74
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,850
because they just statistics methodology
has the,

75
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,150
because it is random,
it gives you access to the horror of the

76
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:30,580
randomness because it wasn't selected on
the basis of it being,

77
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:31,930
as you say,
a compelling story.

78
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,763
It's just like you could spin a roulette
wheel and that will land on a tie where 

79
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:37,210
there's devastation and unnecessary 
death.

80
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,190
That's right.
And,

81
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,093
and many of them are compelling Ansley 
all of them are compelling in their own 

82
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,553
way.
But what was important to me was not to 

83
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:52,540
kind of game it in order to try and draw
out some,

84
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,523
you know,
to draw out a specific emotional 

85
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:55,954
response.
So I was also very determined and went 

86
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,120
back with some foods with my editor 
about it.

87
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,750
Um,
um,

88
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,723
that the,
the order of the death should come in 

89
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:11,920
the order that they were shot.
Not like Hilda Story.

90
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,540
Yeah.
Not the best one here.

91
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,374
And so the first child to be shown,
he's in in some ways the most terrific 

92
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,830
and there is a problem there for,
for a book,

93
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:26,080
which is that you pick up the stories 
about,

94
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,460
you pick up this book.

95
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,210
The first child is the youngest child is
nine years old.

96
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,583
He answers the door and his mom's ex 
lover shoots him in the head and then 

97
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:38,110
runs off and he's,
you know,

98
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:40,000
ends up getting shot by the cops 
himself.

99
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,710
And it's really the story of this kind 
of mums,

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,633
unrelenting grief and her struggle to 
kind of get back to some kind of normal 

101
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:56,770
life.
And ordinarily you wouldn't w you know,

102
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,280
people of,
you know,

103
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:00,740
I read the first chapter and,
and I had to put it down for a week,

104
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:02,210
you know,
um,

105
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,450
but I thought it was important.
Um,

106
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,850
if,
if that's the order in which they came,

107
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,800
then that's the order in which,
you know,

108
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,693
they should be written if I was gaming 
it out or put something a bit easier 

109
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:14,504
first.

110
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,433
Hmm.
Okay.

111
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,513
So obviously what you're saying is true 
is important to you and a kind of 

112
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,370
practical truth as I posted the 
different kinds of truths that emerge in

113
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:27,450
these times that are to do with,
you know,

114
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,333
deliberate construction of stories to 
engender a feeling that some people 

115
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:35,000
would argue even from an artistic 
perspective,

116
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,893
you know,
not necessarily a journalistic 

117
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:37,640
perspective.
I'll know,

118
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:38,530
but,
uh,

119
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,030
it will be more true,
Gary,

120
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:41,781
if the,
if the,

121
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:44,630
if it ends in this climactic moment,
more people,

122
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:46,040
you know,
they've got the kind of way that we were

123
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,630
asked as creative people to,
uh,

124
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,200
compromise is usually a or regional 
people.

125
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:52,280
It'll be easier,
isn't it?

126
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:53,750
Ultimately you want more people that 
read the book.

127
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,703
So why did you have a kind of a,
an almost puritanical determination to 

128
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:01,090
commit to truth?
And it is,

129
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,400
there is something a bit Brechtian in 
about it in that sense of just kind of,

130
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,263
you know,
just here is I guess what I felt was 

131
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,410
how's that Brecht interests as well in 
terms of kind of,

132
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:12,891
um,
uh,

133
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,290
not going to try and manipulate your own

134
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,060
motions here.
Uh,

135
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,750
although I mean the subject matter is 
emotional enough.

136
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,640
I want to engage your critically and one
way.

137
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:27,594
I'm not saying that this is what I say.
I have to do that I made a pitch for 

138
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,283
Brett in book about China.
So I didn't build the way that you 

139
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:36,420
described it.
I thought that sounded a bit like that I

140
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:37,740
met kind of,
um,

141
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,173
uh,
on the one hand the stories are so 

142
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,530
horrific and I feel compelling in their 
own rights that,

143
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,490
um,
um,

144
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:53,923
that I'll need to be gamed.
But that also there is some power in 

145
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:05,670
saying this was the day,
this was how the day progressed.

146
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,060
This is,
this is what happened.

147
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:12,270
And I mean,
it's still my book.

148
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:15,030
So there's still things I left out and 
things I put in.

149
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:15,864
It's not like I didn't edit and it's 
also not like I didn't desire response 

150
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,530
from people,
but that,

151
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,433
um,
to the extent that the premise starts 

152
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:28,704
with something random,
I wanted to keep to keep honest to that 

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,250
as much as I,
uh,

154
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,380
as much as I possibly can.

155
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,810
I can see why you would,
it's a very,

156
00:08:36,811 --> 00:08:37,644
very confronting idea just to say this 
day happened and this is how the day 

157
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,500
unfolded in the react.
This is the reality of that day.

158
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:46,190
So if you feel like that was a brew or 
an unbearable,

159
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:49,410
well that's simply the consequences of 
looking at reality,

160
00:08:49,411 --> 00:08:54,411
not the artistry of a creative person 
with get you over interesting

161
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,250
position to analyze what's happening in 
America with violence more broadly.

162
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:02,424
I read something that you wrote a couple
of days ago about what trump means in 

163
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:09,270
terms of hatred.
Um,

164
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,200
man,
submerged ideas becoming explicit.

165
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,423
Do you,
is there a relationship between the 

166
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:17,670
ideas you're exploring in this 
particular book?

167
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,530
Are there,
are we seeing something that's important

168
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,280
and unique now?
Eh,

169
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,200
do you think in America?
I think we are.

170
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,820
I think that,
um,

171
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,890
it's important to recognize that trump 
didn't invent racism or bigotry,

172
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,930
you know,
he's button,

173
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,843
there's never been someone at such a 
high level who's prepared to be so 

174
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:45,534
brazen about their bigotry.
And that is new to have that lead from 

175
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:53,310
the front.
You know,

176
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:58,311
you can have George Wallace in Alabama,
a segregationist running for president,

177
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:01,540
but nobody thought he was going to whip 
me.

178
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:02,374
It was a protest candidate.
And instead you have trump going to 

179
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:09,981
Alabama,
which only removed at state ban on mixed

180
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:13,080
most managers in two thousand two 
thousand.

181
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,831
I mean,
this is,

182
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:14,664
you know,
you're talking some serious kind of 

183
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,430
Taliban Nael,
right?

184
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,570
Yeah.
You're doing them going all right.

185
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,600
And um,
s um,

186
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,550
trashing these black athletes who,
um,

187
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,573
are making a protest about black lives 
matter now just they fill in the 

188
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:34,670
listeners.
That's the,

189
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,543
this is the protest were nfl players are
kneeling during the national anthem 

190
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,830
because they're saying this,
this anthem don't include me.

191
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,480
Is that the idea that this anthem,
until he's handsome,

192
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,670
represents the ideals of the country,
are not going to stand up for him.

193
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,110
And,
um,

194
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,510
and I guess relating that to the themes 
in the book,

195
00:10:56,511 --> 00:11:00,050
I mean most interesting in the book is 
none of the kids,

196
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,760
all of the shootings that we know of 
same race,

197
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,820
which is usually in America,
America is segregated to death.

198
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,870
So white people kill white people.
Black people kill black people.

199
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,980
That's why the,
the,

200
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,873
the term black on black violence doesn't
mean anything cause it's just violence 

201
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:20,720
as how American violence works.
And um,

202
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,990
um,
and none of them are killed by cops.

203
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:25,963
But the date,
the November the 23rd 2013 comes in 

204
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,270
between,
uh,

205
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,300
when George Zimmerman is acquitted for 
shooting Trayvon Martin Dead in Florida,

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,500
which was when the black lives matter 
Hashtag was coined and Ferguson,

207
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,980
which is when it really took off.
When Michael Brown is showing back up in

208
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,173
broad daylight and this and some Louis.
So it comes in between those and it 

209
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:54,364
doesn't come.
None of the death conform to that kind 

210
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,154
of,
uh,

211
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,200
that morality play of white cop,
black kid.

212
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,683
Um,
but there are two ways in which it 

213
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:07,084
relates to the broader theme in the 
first is the way that the police treat 

214
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:14,260
these deaths for the most part,
which is well,

215
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,060
you know,
that's the kind of thing that you know,

216
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,000
happens down there.

217
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,220
So they don't,
very few of the deaths are um,

218
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,780
solved.
You know,

219
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,833
very few of the murders are solved and 
most of the parents think that becomes 

220
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:31,720
on even trying.
And then the other thing is the way that

221
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:34,270
they're treated by the press,
which is,

222
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,770
that's not news really.
If a kid gets killed down there,

223
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,620
that's where kids get killed.
You know.

224
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:45,880
So I didn't actually do this in the 
book,

225
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:46,714
but develop this kind of notion 
subsequently that when I went to 

226
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:52,300
journalism school,
there was,

227
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:53,610
you know,
there's this thing when,

228
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:55,570
uh,
when dope by some man.

229
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:57,550
And that's not a story when a man bites 
dog,

230
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,670
that's the story.
But sometimes you have to ask yourself,

231
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,133
why do these dogs keep buying people?
And why the same people keep getting 

232
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,124
bitten and who controls these dogs.
Sometimes the fact that someone keeps 

233
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:09,544
happening in a place is a reason to 
investigate it and no reason to ignore 

234
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:13,990
it.

235
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,930
That's very interesting isn't it?
Because I suppose that the normalization

236
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:20,740
is an important part of the 
intoxication.

237
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,990
That this is normal.
Do not question it.

238
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,033
Leave it alone.
Even that well known journalistic trope 

239
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,643
isn't it?
I suppose a way of establishing what 

240
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,860
normal is.
We surprised at what is acceptable.

241
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,933
I learned because I,
I'm a part of it is that these podcasts 

242
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:42,480
of cancer to university now and I wanted
to learn more and uh,

243
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:45,160
I learned this thing about net crow 
politics,

244
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:45,994
like who it's okay to kill can and I 
suppose in the normalization of the 

245
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,680
deaths of these children in these 
particular regions,

246
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:55,630
what you're saying is what the more that
in the state in that it doesn't matter.

247
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:59,430
You are indicating that this is,
you're continually broadcasting.

248
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,890
It doesn't matter that they're dying.
It doesn't matter.

249
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,980
They're dying.
Exactly.

250
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:02,590
The black lives

251
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,423
don't matter.
And there are these assignments and 

252
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:05,980
these assumptions come,
uh,

253
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:09,190
come out.
So one boy in Dallas,

254
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,420
he's,
um,

255
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,553
um,
he gets just 80 words in the Dallas 

256
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:15,460
Morning News,
um,

257
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,130
saying that he was shot dead while he 
was walking with his friend.

258
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,720
And then the first comment after this 80
words is this a woman saying,

259
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,560
well,
I don't want to blame the victim.

260
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:26,170
And then of course,
that's what exactly what she'd done.

261
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:27,280
Right.
Um,

262
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,560
but you know,
where were the parents?

263
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:30,394
You know,
I wouldn't let my kid out at 1130 at 

264
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:33,670
night.
This is,

265
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:36,400
you know,
um,

266
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,360
uh,
parents have taught us some sales,

267
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,203
more questions and that the first thing 
that raises is what time should have 

268
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:45,370
kicked me out and not get shot.
You know,

269
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:48,860
when's curfew for kind of child,
you know,

270
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,270
don't shoot after time.
Children can be shot exactly.

271
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:56,180
Side when they say he was a,
he was an a student and it's like,

272
00:14:56,181 --> 00:15:01,181
well,
what grade you have to get b plus,

273
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:02,294
you know,
fortunately that a child wasn't doing 

274
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:05,790
that well academically,
you know?

275
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,710
Yeah,
yeah.

276
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,360
If only you just pulled his,
you know,

277
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,891
just,
just,

278
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:12,500
just trying to bet barry Algebra,
maybe he'd still be alone.

279
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,050
It's a big,
big rights.

280
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,233
But then sneaking me,
this woman knows nothing about his 

281
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:18,884
family,

282
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,013
this family,
cause it's not like they were 

283
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:25,730
interviewed.
You want to go 80 words and you find out

284
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:26,564
that his mom knew exactly where he was.
And that night it had been with his 

285
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:31,364
friend who was over because he was going
with his grounding to church the next 

286
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,650
day.
No word of a lie.

287
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:40,370
And this is why it's useful to have 
these other things where you're saying,

288
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:43,260
I'm not saying yeah,
because it just sounds so idealic.

289
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,890
They drank cocoa,
they watched,

290
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:48,380
we're the millers and they played two.
Now,

291
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,140
the worst thing that Samuel Brightman 
did,

292
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:54,110
he's the kid who was shot that night was
cheat at now.

293
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,483
And he was a very,
very persistent cheetah who know by all 

294
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,910
accounts.
Then he decided to walk his friend,

295
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,930
the six minutes bank to his granny's 
house.

296
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,570
And during that six minutes he was shot 
dead.

297
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,380
Nobody knows why Samuel that only moved 
that quite recently.

298
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,660
Some you didn't hurt anyone.
He's quite a sweet,

299
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,170
quite fragile kid actually.
Uh,

300
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,750
by every accountable,
the people that knew him.

301
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,750
And there's lots of kids in the book 
where nobody says that about them.

302
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,720
Um,
and um,

303
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,180
uh,
and then you got this woman saying,

304
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:30,400
well,
you know,

305
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,210
I blame the parents and you went,
well,

306
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,160
no,
you know,

307
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,690
no,
you don't know the parents.

308
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:36,524
But there is an assumption if you're 
black and working costs and you live in 

309
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:42,410
some of these areas that it's not just 
like,

310
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,530
well,
we don't know anyone like that.

311
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,803
It's that they're kind of almost a 
different species where the parents 

312
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:51,734
don't love their kids and the kids 
doesn't love life and the pennants and 

313
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,980
negligent and the kids are feral.

314
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,013
I understand.
It's like it becomes permissible and 

315
00:16:58,211 --> 00:16:59,044
inevitable.
So I learned a few things they had like 

316
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,313
the black lives matters is a necessary 
response to the assumption black lives 

317
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,510
don't matter.
The unstated blank lives don't ma'am.

318
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,703
I see also that your commitment to truth
is a requirement because what we're 

319
00:17:15,641 --> 00:17:16,474
dealing with is the management of 
narrative in order to facilitate a 

320
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:20,854
particular response.
That in a sense that the first comment 

321
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:28,960
after the iee word a eulogy was,
uh,

322
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,870
like that's almost like a reflex that 
that person had.

323
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,943
Well,
what do you say when a black person is 

324
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:35,080
killed in that era?
Oh,

325
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,943
right,
well where were the parents and it's 

326
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:37,440
been late at night,
you know,

327
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,273
I mean,
we couldn't have a result of 

328
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,724
conditioning.
I was in America when a trayvon Martin 

329
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,833
was murdered and I like this.
Even the sort of grammar of news is 

330
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,100
obvious gone an intensity to it.
There's sort of,

331
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:50,934
you see the police cars you've seen over
at helicopter shot of a law and it also 

332
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:57,630
seems a bit like it's all merging into 
crime and gang.

333
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,480
Even if those words aren't explicitly 
being said,

334
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,420
because those tracks exist in my mind 
already.

335
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:06,450
So all we need to do is far a few little
triggers and I'll go,

336
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:08,280
yeah,
probably that kid was sort of a criminal

337
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:09,101
or some value,
you know,

338
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:09,934
like it's,
it takes effort to unpick my 

339
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:14,394
conditioning is a why English person in 
America having already been 

340
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,540
indoctrinated before my arrival.

341
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,870
Yeah,
I mean it,

342
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,850
it takes everybody method.
Actually even the email,

343
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,940
um,
uh,

344
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,030
I mean different efforts with different 
kinds of people,

345
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:26,864
but the condition and the dominance,
that kind of hedge many of that 

346
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:35,561
narrative is so strong that the parents 
of the kids who die will say to you,

347
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,620
he hadn't been in trouble with the 
police.

348
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,573
He didn't do drugs.
And what they're doing is listing the 

349
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:46,190
reasons why he shouldn't have died.
A high end listing.

350
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,280
The reasons why they charge shouldn't 
have died every single,

351
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:50,114
so there were 10 kids got shot dead that
during that 24 hour period and they 

352
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:54,920
weren't all black,
seven were black to Latino,

353
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:57,980
one wine,
every single blank parent.

354
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,870
When you ask them,
did you think this would happen?

355
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,540
Did you had,
you know,

356
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,490
was this on your radar to a person?
They all said,

357
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:09,470
oh,
oh yeah,

358
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,040
yeah.

359
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,320
I mean,
Samuel's mom and Samuel,

360
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,213
you know,
he didn't get in trouble in school or 

361
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:16,310
anything and his mom said,
well,

362
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:18,020
I didn't think it'd be a,
my thought would be his brother.

363
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,530
Yeah,
the data new Eric just said,

364
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,373
did not doing your job properly.
If you don't think that your kid could 

365
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:28,660
be short in this city,
just email you.

366
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,180
So there is this kind of,
what did you call it?

367
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,100
Macro,
macro politics.

368
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,413
Politics is kind of,
it's not just for the dominant forces 

369
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,670
in,
in terms of who should be show a kind of

370
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,453
encompasses all of us are thinking,
well I have two American kids and we 

371
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:55,100
were living in America when I was 
writing his book.

372
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,250
Um,
that's when you realize,

373
00:19:58,251 --> 00:19:59,150
yeah,
that's the,

374
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,290
that's the fear I have for my child.
I'm walking around with that too.

375
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,070
Um,
there was a weird thing in the reporting

376
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:09,260
of it cause people went on about 
parenting.

377
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,093
So manage,
so I saw it looking to see if there's 

378
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:14,780
any documentation about parenting and 
race.

379
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,810
And I found out that,
uh,

380
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,300
this was a government study,
that black dance,

381
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,381
well,
first of all,

382
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:24,680
more likely to be single dads and any 
other race,

383
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,380
but secondly,
we're more likely to buy.

384
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,720
They've read to help their children with
homework,

385
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,890
uh,
uh,

386
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,640
have breakfast with them.
A whole range of things that black dads,

387
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,580
while they were least happy to live with
the mother,

388
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,690
they were the most likely to do all 
these things with their kids.

389
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:45,741
And I just thought,
well,

390
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:46,574
that can't be true you.
So then I'm looking at a range of black 

391
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:51,154
that,
well now this is when I'm looking 

392
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:54,430
through,
you know,

393
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,393
um,
trying to find someone who's written 

394
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,680
something to amend.
I think,

395
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:00,514
well,
what the hell are you doing your black 

396
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:06,391
that you do all those things and somehow
you kind of,

397
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,960
you know,
the,

398
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,723
the,
the idea is so dominant that you just 

399
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:14,100
said,
well,

400
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,250
you know,
obviously no,

401
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,200
you know,
but it was,

402
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,790
it's more powerful than our own mind.
Like the Groucho Marx quote,

403
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,740
who are you going to believe me or your 
own eyes?

404
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,980
And that voice becomes so dominant in 
your consciousness,

405
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:29,370
they use zips reality.
Oh,

406
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,460
that's what I say.
Now I see the importance of the device,

407
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,323
that truth,
like if the commitment of the simple 

408
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:38,010
truth expose these narratives,
uh,

409
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,450
so a visceral Starlin,
an erv ethic,

410
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:46,770
it reawakens asked from the 
normalization of the death of children.

411
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:48,720
So in your book,
it's like older than a minute.

412
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,890
Children die in isn't a thing that you 
just isn't,

413
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:51,724
it's not an Aae word,
a bitchery and then just roll your eyes 

414
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:56,460
and say,
it must be parental responsibility.

415
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,443
Now I can sort of see again,
the idea of parental responsibility and 

416
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:06,030
incorporation of crime and stuff into 
those stories is a way of enhancing both

417
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:10,230
the idea that these somehow culpability 
of the victim,

418
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,093
your responsible and that has,
that that plays a big role in American 

419
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:16,140
culture in that it's part of the 
general,

420
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,520
this is an individualized culture.

421
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,470
If there's some terrible bad thing 
happening to you,

422
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,920
it's not because you're this color or 
from this economic class in trial.

423
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,680
Yeah.
He should have tried to be artist to not

424
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:26,550
get shot and like,
you know,

425
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:29,490
so like in this all to be it a different
hue.

426
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,563
So,
um,

427
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,860
it's based,
that's an actually,

428
00:22:31,861 --> 00:22:36,360
that's a sort of a vital fred in perhaps
it's the defining fred of,

429
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,500
uh,
the,

430
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,423
uh,
American ideology is individualism and 

431
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:41,274
personal culpability versus any kind of 
connected collective or national 

432
00:22:44,611 --> 00:22:45,444
responsibility.
That's something that's continually 

433
00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:47,304
being eroded.
How this gun culture participate in 

434
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:50,760
this?
Why is it like,

435
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:51,594
given that you're a person who tells 
stories in the way that you do what you 

436
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,323
like,
it's not an like we saw other people 

437
00:22:55,261 --> 00:22:56,094
just like guns.
Why is this idea so a irresistible to 

438
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:01,440
American people?
Why,

439
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:02,580
why isn't it like that?
You know,

440
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,414
like you see sort of like a Bama speech 
after sandy hook or wherever and he's 

441
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:07,171
like,
oh right,

442
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:10,140
that's the day now where we don't have 
guns anymore.

443
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:10,891
It's just like,
no.

444
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,600
Why,
why is this fall so powerful?

445
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:13,960
What does it mean to their unconscious?

446
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,060
Which is which?
It's an excellent question.

447
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,133
And,
um,

448
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,850
I guess one of the best ways to explain 
it would be,

449
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:26,684
and you touched on it there in terms of 
tapping into some core things about how 

450
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:31,364
America feels about itself.
They've got nothing to do with guns but 

451
00:23:34,251 --> 00:23:36,410
work quite well with guns.
So,

452
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,170
um,
when I used to go to the NRA,

453
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:40,890
I went through a couple of NRA 
convention,

454
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,330
the National Rifle Association,
which is the gun lobby.

455
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,400
Um,
what's the vibe?

456
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:47,720
Like?
Weird,

457
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,660
weird and kind of,
um,

458
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,803
it's a lot of white guys.
That's the kind of 90% of the 

459
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:56,090
demographic,
probably more,

460
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,770
although they're trying to push gums in 
more in women's direction,

461
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:01,604
said lots of now pink guns and Nice 
things that you can carry your gun in 

462
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:08,420
and kind of ways to look pretty with 
your gun and stuff like that.

463
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,740
But,
um,

464
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,573
um,
lots of white guys and I almost kind of 

465
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,770
almost sexual relationship to these,
to these weapons.

466
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:19,603
You know,
they kind of the stroking them and they 

467
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,011
kind of,
you know,

468
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:23,280
the,
the,

469
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,200
you know,
that pouring them basically.

470
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,240
And I would really play up my 
englishness in these things.

471
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:33,410
I mean,
first of all,

472
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:35,210
cause it,
you know,

473
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,480
it helps and second because it mitigates
the blackness,

474
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,413
but we throw me now and I'm down to my 
becoming out of your mouth from Steven 

475
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,140
is really,
and I've got puff Daddy,

476
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:56,010
I'm looking at Puff Daddy,
but I'm hearing them.

477
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,760
If I could explain stevenage to then 
that would,

478
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,620
so everything else,
everybody,

479
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,660
Steven,
you can continue with your prejudices in

480
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:10,160
Essex to Steven Itching.
Um,

481
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,250
and I signed that.
Understand this,

482
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,310
I don't understand this.
Explain it to me.

483
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,280
And to a person,
they were off to the races.

484
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,600
They'll say,
are you married?

485
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,073
Do you have children?
Imagine someone broke into your house 

486
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,033
and they wanted to rape your wife and 
kill your children and take everything 

487
00:25:28,971 --> 00:25:31,520
that you worked for what you're going to
do.

488
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,691
Uh,
you can,

489
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:35,090
uh,
wave a stick sticker them,

490
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,353
you're going to call the cops and wait 
for the cops to come or you're going to 

491
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:41,890
defend your family and defend what 
you've learned.

492
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,430
And so it speaks to kind of masculinity,
homestead,

493
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,870
um,
a small government individualism,

494
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,830
a notion of kind of my being right 
defend what's yours.

495
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,200
Now the reality is,
well,

496
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,870
there are several kinds of facts that 
contradict that.

497
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:00,704
Firstly,
most people who are shot dead killed 

498
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:05,030
themselves.
Secondly,

499
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,183
you must often that you're much more 
likely to be sheltered by someone you 

500
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:09,554
know,
did someone you'd done so well I should 

501
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:13,040
say is,
are you married?

502
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,701
Yes.
Well,

503
00:26:13,701 --> 00:26:18,470
watch out for your wife.
And so,

504
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,300
um,
they are,

505
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:25,630
um,
survey evoke these very primal yes,

506
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,370
things in the culture and when 
confronted with that,

507
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:36,560
if you start talking about background 
checks and um,

508
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,973
you know,
bamming semiautomatic weapons and stuff 

509
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:41,294
like that,
he's not really a match for these basic 

510
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,260
ideas of American individualism,
small government masculinity and so on.

511
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,363
You're talking about tinkering.
We think so they have a powerful 

512
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:57,531
narrative that they can tap into and the
gun control people done.

513
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,883
It's brilliant isn't it?
Because it doesn't seem like it should 

514
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:01,764
be important enough.
A national rifle association and he's 

515
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:05,664
like,
you imagined the English version and I 

516
00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:07,244
have just been a bunch of cases in 
Berber jackets hanging around in the 

517
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:10,914
shyest that wouldn't be,
you wouldn't think affecting policy of 

518
00:27:13,221 --> 00:27:14,054
that.
I'm sure we have our own sort of 

519
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,010
uniquely bizarre equivalent within some 
of our,

520
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,873
more to temik issue in our own culture.
But what I was struck by Gary there was 

521
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:25,350
like it shows you the limits of the 
rational mind,

522
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,213
which is curious when we live in what is
a pointedly a rationalistic of 

523
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,014
materialist culture that's based 
primarily it's least explicitly on 

524
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:36,720
economics that people's drives are not 
being sourced from rationale.

525
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,613
Cause if you hit them with none,
I know you're most likely first to kill 

526
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:41,850
yourself or be killed by someone that 
you know.

527
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,760
So the best thing you can do if that is 
your fear,

528
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:47,520
if fear is your motivator,
he's do not have a gun.

529
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,650
It doesn't just stay in.
Yes they endorsed that go out.

530
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,563
But that is the ultimate solution.
Just atrophy in a cupboard had the 

531
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,180
brilliant the solution wasting away in a
market space.

532
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,280
So like it just shows you the truth 
again is irrelevant.

533
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,173
It's irrelevant because they must know 
that they must know they must have been 

534
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:10,890
hit with those stats.
Do you think?

535
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,080
Well they have

536
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:18,270
and what what they do is they deflect 
them to other things.

537
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:23,620
So you're talking about the hood,
Adam [inaudible].

538
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,810
That's where these things happen,
you know.

539
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,540
So if you say to them,
which is true,

540
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:32,010
you're much more likely to be shot.
People who have guns in the house,

541
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:32,844
I'm much more,
I used to be shot than they basically 

542
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:35,404
deflect that too.
Now you're talking about black people 

543
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,103
really.
So when I was promoting my book in 

544
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:42,980
America on the radio,
uh,

545
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,890
it was a Conan Chow and one guy said,
um,

546
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,240
if you just took out a few cities in 
America,

547
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,680
then that whole average would be kind of
way lower.

548
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,510
And I'm saying,
well yeah,

549
00:28:58,511 --> 00:29:01,080
but if you took half few seasoned in,
wouldn't be America would do.

550
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:04,090
I mean America is a hot wallet take out 
Chicago,

551
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,500
New York,
La,

552
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,280
Detroit,
where you can get cars from where you're

553
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,990
going to get your blues from,
where you know,

554
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,760
wait,
he believes from,

555
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,783
so that's again,
it's in its coded like that this is a 

556
00:29:15,281 --> 00:29:18,460
get even mentally,
there is ghettoization happening.

557
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,493
Why that statistics and nation is 
regarded incorporates a [inaudible] oh 

558
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,433
this is terrible statistic.
But fortunately as white people that 

559
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:27,670
live in a suburban area,
it's irrelevant.

560
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,150
And that cause I,
that's facilitated by an individualistic

561
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,261
idea,
isn't it?

562
00:29:32,261 --> 00:29:34,420
Or an individualistic perspective of,
of,

563
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,640
uh,
of yourself and your country,

564
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:37,930
I suppose,
of their country.

565
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:38,950
So like this,
um,

566
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,420
oh,
your kids are American.

567
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,850
So listen though,
uh,

568
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,430
the other thing you mentioned,
this is like everything in that national

569
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:48,760
rifle connect a convention seemed like 
it was primal,

570
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,560
you know,
their sexual connection,

571
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,620
the idea of power,
the idea of fear.

572
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,500
So when we're talking about guns,
we're not really talking about guns,

573
00:29:56,501 --> 00:29:59,410
we're talking about power and fear,
sexual energies,

574
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,950
Leighton impotence,
sense of social breakdown,

575
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,410
rampant individualism.
Uh,

576
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,513
so it's a very,
very difficult thing to unravel because 

577
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:11,240
you,
it's very hard for people to get,

578
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,083
like I wonder what would literally app 
like why is it that it's no president 

579
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,580
can countenance or no government can 
count and it's,

580
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:19,414
listen,
we're just doing this thing cause it's 

581
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:24,200
playing with the right thing to do.
Consequences.

582
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,103
Yeah.

583
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,610
There's probably,
there's a fatalism about it.

584
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:33,020
So when I asked every family that I 
spoke to,

585
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,060
so what do you think is going on here?
When I ask them open ended question,

586
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:41,180
none of them mentioned guns.
Wow.

587
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:46,210
Because I figure in the book it's like 
if your kid got run over,

588
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,950
you wouldn't say,
well traffic,

589
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,813
we'd have to get rid of traffic cause 
you can't imagine a world without 

590
00:30:52,221 --> 00:30:53,520
traffic.
Um,

591
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,373
so,

592
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,760
um,
you know,

593
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,553
imagining the world without God thing I 
mentioned poverty that I mentioned 

594
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:02,880
racism because it's like,
well that's everywhere.

595
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,093
So kind of Ha you know,
so I'm going to go with now parents or 

596
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:12,120
that Kid's dad or this is a rough 
neighborhood.

597
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:13,740
But no,
the kind of

598
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,940
uh,
uh,

599
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,460
bigger thing.
It's brilliant.

600
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,100
I also think that kind of,
um,

601
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:24,030
uh,
guns a big business and so there is,

602
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,920
that's what

603
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,240
they have to be bigger than that 
wouldn't it?

604
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:28,074
Cause like they're statistically give 
financially is not enough to have that 

605
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:35,070
kind of potency.
It must be serving something very,

606
00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:35,904
very powerful.
And I think that what you said there 

607
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,160
about the people can't imagine it,
we just can't,

608
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,143
that's been taken off the table.
The idea that we could moderate Shafiq 

609
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:46,104
the idea that we could moderate guns,
all of these ideas are excluded and we 

610
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:52,140
accept that this is a,
this is reality.

611
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,183
And I think probably all of us are on 
that scale somewhere with what we can 

612
00:31:55,951 --> 00:31:56,784
conceive of and how radical a change 
we're willing to countenance how 

613
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,870
beautiful the world we're prepared to 
imagine.

614
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,543
None of us are willing to start.
Like so like what kind of conclusions 

615
00:32:09,331 --> 00:32:10,164
does this lead you to in terms of power 
structures and the way that power 

616
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:15,070
operates,
if you sort of,

617
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:18,090
if it seems literally unimaginable to 
know Afghans?

618
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,003
Well,
the,

619
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,940
I miss as you suggest,
this can work for almost anything in any

620
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:30,491
country that if you are able to kind of 
swamp the field in a way,

621
00:32:31,611 --> 00:32:33,230
if you are able to kind of,

622
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,380
okay,

623
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,213
if you were able to remove something 
from public discussion and remove it 

624
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:44,660
from public countenance,
then um,

625
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,153
uh,
then there's no reason why I shouldn't 

626
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:52,520
go on forever.
So I kind of,

627
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:53,354
different example would be nuclear 
weapons are used to be quite involved 

628
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:57,854
with cmd.
I used to be on the National Council of 

629
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,700
CMV and I went away for kind of 12 
years,

630
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:03,230
15 years to,
uh,

631
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,064
to the states.
And when I came back and Coban and one 

632
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:06,594
of them he talked about getting rid of 
tried and I kind of thought have you 

633
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:13,960
still got tried and true domain is that 
people to stop talking about it?

634
00:33:13,961 --> 00:33:16,850
It stopped being,
you can just tell him it stopped being a

635
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:19,060
thing.
And you know,

636
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,210
I thought,
God,

637
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:21,044
how weird.
I felt we were supposed to be afraid of 

638
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,510
the like young men from the North West 
with backpacks.

639
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,403
That's right.
And we've got this kind of lumbering 

640
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,990
kind of weird who's,
who are we supposed to be firing that?

641
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,833
Yeah.
But kind of it had been removed from 

642
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:41,480
discuss.
I'd just kind of stop thinking.

643
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,370
And you were a president was ncn be 
obviously a breast of these ideas.

644
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,860
So that's very interesting.
It's always a code to be,

645
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:52,020
we you're talking to their mate was that
we operate in,

646
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,863
in a time where the powerful,
now I have a master data and the 

647
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:56,734
historical knowledge of how public 
consciousness and the public sphere 

648
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:00,694
works.
So they almost know you only got to 

649
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:05,200
manage this for a little bit of time and
we're all going to be cool.

650
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:06,034
And I think an obvious and pertinent 
recent example is grand felt and the 

651
00:34:08,741 --> 00:34:11,830
management of the deaths around the toes
just keep,

652
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:13,510
just keep distracting,
don't talk about,

653
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:14,344
don't clarify any information.
It will dissipate as surely we'll know 

654
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:20,800
like one of those totemic events that 
scars are national consciousness because

655
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:23,380
it's almost too perfect.
This sometimes happens.

656
00:34:23,381 --> 00:34:26,200
I notice in current affairs were 
symbolically many,

657
00:34:26,201 --> 00:34:29,400
many Fred's come together and there's an
indelible connection to truth.

658
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,220
You can't,
you go,

659
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,740
oh no,
this must be because we've long regarded

660
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:36,760
poor people as dispensable and we've 
been making terrible financial decisions

661
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:39,400
and we'd be ignoring it and all of our 
social infrastructures,

662
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,403
a paper tigers and there's nothing set 
up to protect people and we actually 

663
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:43,924
don't care.
So now we're going to have to stare it 

664
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:46,570
in the face.
Even in that,

665
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:49,270
when that kind of emblematic event 
occurs,

666
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,910
there's a sort of sense that just ride 
this out,

667
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,030
they'll stop caring.
Other stuff will happen in a while.

668
00:34:55,031 --> 00:34:59,680
This will seem like an obsolete concern,
like trident replaced with a newer,

669
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,810
more novel kind of fear.

670
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:02,803
Yeah,
I met,

671
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,020
I mean your point about Grunfeld cause 
I,

672
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,430
I do remember thinking at the time,
um,

673
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,563
cause it happened a week after the 
election and we count the election and 

674
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,353
that effectively what had happened June 
now election was that Labor had 

675
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,280
introduced a series of ideas that were 
once considered mainstream.

676
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:30,230
And actually in most of Europe are 
considered mainstream,

677
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:31,940
barely had been removed from the public 
square.

678
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,790
We're going to tax rich people a bit 
more.

679
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,140
Um,
uh,

680
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,003
we've done and not have tuition fees,
which when I started at university 

681
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:40,780
didn't exist.
Um,

682
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,030
we are,
you know,

683
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,893
we're gonna,
we're gonna move to a reality that we 

684
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:46,470
actually have within my,
you know,

685
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:48,060
living memory.
I'm 48,

686
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,350
so it's not like,
you know,

687
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,990
I'm loud.
And they,

688
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,420
um,
I'm,

689
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,730
I made called austerity,
what it was.

690
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,820
And so there was,
when grenfell happened,

691
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:02,490
I do think there was a price for people 
to put it,

692
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,530
that we've just had this moment.

693
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,760
And then Graham felt happened and there 
was a kind of like,

694
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,840
that's kind of something that we've been
talking about.

695
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,733
You don't have that.
It was that it was part of the 

696
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:17,820
constellation that kind of brought those
threads together.

697
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:19,760
And I think,
and um,

698
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,173
uh,
and I saw it in on social media where 

699
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:29,610
when things like this happen,
there's always a group of people kind of

700
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:34,670
who I'm sympathetic too who want to draw
the border conclusions and say,

701
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:35,461
you know,
look,

702
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,020
this is part of something bigger.
You know,

703
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:37,854
if it's nine 11 or whatever.
And then there's always a group of 

704
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:41,694
people who seem to be more dominant and 
in any case have the power of the media 

705
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:45,414
behind them who say,
you're exploring this tragedy for play 

706
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:49,770
command.
Stop talking,

707
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,880
stop talking about all the serious stuff
and respect for the victims.

708
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,660
And they tried that on social media and 
we've grandfathered,

709
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:58,494
it didn't work.

710
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,430
People were like,
no,

711
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:01,620
this is exactly the time to talk about 
this.

712
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:04,860
What else should we be talking about?
And I do feel that,

713
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:05,880
I'm not saying,
you know,

714
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,650
Jeremy Corbyn made that happen,
but that um,

715
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,760
coming out of this election there was a,
there was a price to go,

716
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:18,150
there was a language for it and people 
were kind of achieved to me.

717
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,553
And um,
and it's one of those examples where 

718
00:37:22,111 --> 00:37:22,950
people,
you know,

719
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:23,641
people go,
well,

720
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:24,900
they'll neighbor didn't win,
you know,

721
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:25,734
and it's like,
well actually they won quite a lot of 

722
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:32,841
arguments and they change the national 
conversation and yes,

723
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:34,440
they are not the,
you know,

724
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,303
they have not formed a government,
but let's not pretend they didn't win 

725
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:40,200
anything.
It didn't change anything.

726
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,100
A slight,
there's an identifiable disjunct because

727
00:37:43,101 --> 00:37:43,934
the sort of proceeding media noise was 
so much about condemnation and ridicule 

728
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,083
that the fact that in the face of that 
there was a positive reaction in a 

729
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,104
positive result,
it starts to demonstrate this fissure 

730
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,123
that exists between this is the reality 
we are telling you and this is the 

731
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:06,161
reality you are experiencing now.
The efficacy of media in dead Indian and

732
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,670
a mosque in our own reality.
Even as you said,

733
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,210
like,
yeah,

734
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,043
I was thinking like that.
Even me as a person that I like to 

735
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:13,971
think,
oh,

736
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:16,340
I'm really up for change and sort of 
radical ideas.

737
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,383
Like I feel like a giddy school girls,
they might get rid of this tuition fees 

738
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,190
go bloody hell.
He's like,

739
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:23,420
you're right.
I mean like,

740
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,330
but in my lifetime,
that free education,

741
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,430
he's already that the way that it is 
situated.

742
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,800
Now what this suggests to me,
mate,

743
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:30,634
and given that we sort of started off 
talking about the way we tell stories 

744
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:37,630
and you elected with your most book to 
make a commitment to truth,

745
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,680
even if that costs you in a structural 
sense,

746
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:42,311
like,
oh no,

747
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:45,130
the best terrible death occurs too 
early,

748
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:46,360
or whatever it is.
You know?

749
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,780
So one thing I think that seems to be 
occurring is the outcome.

750
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:56,110
Then what?
What are we doing?

751
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:58,690
If we've got true for on our side,
broadly speaking,

752
00:38:58,691 --> 00:38:59,740
by which I mean,
you know,

753
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:00,574
collectivize breakdown.
Powerwall stopped telling me stories of 

754
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:06,430
the individual stop ignoring how the 
influence of the powerful ways,

755
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:08,950
having a devastating effect on ordinary 
people's lives.

756
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:11,550
Stop separating from one another,
finding reasons to hate each other.

757
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,533
They are how,
why are we not able to tell these 

758
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:18,130
stories in an effective way if we have 
true for now side.

759
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,920
Why is this dominant story continuing

760
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,770
dominate?
Um,

761
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,600
I mean I think there are a few reasons.
There's probably millions,

762
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:28,590
but just,
I mean,

763
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,003
pardon me,
I fear sometimes we don't quite even 

764
00:39:32,281 --> 00:39:33,860
believe those stories are sales,
right?

765
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:37,020
That we want things to be true.
But,

766
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,460
um,
we,

767
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,680
we don't know where the album we quite 
atomized.

768
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,280
So there are these moments when you 
realize,

769
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,623
oh my God,
everybody else has been seeing at the 

770
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,450
telly.
[inaudible] tell me who else,

771
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,410
six months as well.
I didn't realize.

772
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,313
So this is that moment jumie election 
where it was one of the questions times 

773
00:39:56,131 --> 00:39:56,964
when a young woman says this discussion 
about nuclear weapons and disarmament 

774
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,933
and she says,
I'm just wondering why so many people 

775
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:08,340
want to bomb everyone and there's a big 
cheer in the audience.

776
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:08,701
Like,
yeah,

777
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:09,630
what,
what,

778
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,450
what are we,
why are we having that conversation?

779
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,410
Who Do you want to Boehm.

780
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,420
And so there are,
we've,

781
00:40:15,421 --> 00:40:17,470
we all feel like,
well,

782
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,010
maybe it's just me.
There's a lack of confidence.

783
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:25,070
I guess Dennis is also true.
I think that we are,

784
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,240
um,
uh,

785
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,000
for the most part,
not withstanding social media,

786
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:33,030
we don't run stuff,
you know,

787
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:38,031
we don't own a large media corporations 
and things like that.

788
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:45,320
We are still kind of quite marginal in 
terms of the means of distribution.

789
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:50,400
And then certainly in a country like 
Britain or America,

790
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:55,401
you have the kind of weight of this kind
of awful history,

791
00:40:55,561 --> 00:41:00,040
which to some extent,
um,

792
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,960
could damn the people within it.
So if you want to talk honestly,

793
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:07,580
say about British racism or about 
Britain,

794
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:08,414
then you'll have to talk about empire 
and slavery and murder and a range of 

795
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:15,780
things that kind of people feel 
implicated him.

796
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:16,710
If you say,
um,

797
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,001
you know,
people say,

798
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:19,260
well,
um,

799
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,143
people will say we want a wall,
or even though they didn't fight or we 

800
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:29,220
won the World Cup,
even though they didn't play,

801
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:30,054
but they'll never say we own slaves 
stole stuff that just not going to do 

802
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:38,000
that.
They're not going to claim that.

803
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,253
And so having kind of honest 
conversations about who we are and what 

804
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:45,350
we've done,
um,

805
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,550
people kind of shy away from that.
So in more powerful countries,

806
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,460
people kind of,
um,

807
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,693
the more honest conversation and the 
more truthful conversation is also kind 

808
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:57,590
of a more difficult conversation,

809
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,673
put too much into our shadows.
We've allowed this to be a kind of a 

810
00:42:02,101 --> 00:42:05,250
repository of truth where we don't look 
at,

811
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,650
oh no,
this is what Britain mean.

812
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,680
So be careful when you talk about 
Britain,

813
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:12,600
this is what freedom,
this is what we have done,

814
00:42:12,601 --> 00:42:14,430
this is what we missed out.
So true.

815
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,560
Like we've become,
and of course there are many,

816
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:17,394
many troops,
but there are so many unaddressed 

817
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:20,783
aspects of our reality that I suppose 
I'm a constructed reality is that we're 

818
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,350
invited to participate in seem more 
tactile,

819
00:42:28,351 --> 00:42:33,090
more attractive because we're a sort of 
an unwillingness for us to embrace our,

820
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,320
the,
the truth of who we are culturally own.

821
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,250
I would have to argue who we are 
individually that there's been,

822
00:42:38,251 --> 00:42:40,020
there's a reluctance like I,
so it was,

823
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:42,690
I think Gary,
like is it like,

824
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,520
you know,
like I hold these ideals,

825
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:48,090
but if say like in a perhaps because I 
don't like it when people go me,

826
00:42:48,091 --> 00:42:49,530
well,
why don't you give up all your money?

827
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,840
Then I always think that's like,
oh fuck off and leave me alone.

828
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,440
Stop cutting me out of the argument.
Right.

829
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,260
My Leica,
I do some I think would it like,

830
00:42:58,261 --> 00:42:58,891
right,
okay,

831
00:42:58,891 --> 00:43:02,250
what happens if I go,
these people are going to cut.

832
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:04,800
Anyone who needs a house is can come and
live in my house.

833
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:06,660
Now what's that gonna do to my 
consciousness?

834
00:43:06,661 --> 00:43:09,160
What is my resistance to that idea?
Easier?

835
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,003
A personal thing.
Now I know I've got limited power as an 

836
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:14,020
individual,
but is my unwillingness to commit.

837
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:14,470
You say,
man,

838
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,200
willingness to look at what in my 
shadow,

839
00:43:16,201 --> 00:43:18,660
my own selfishness,
my own capitalism,

840
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,720
my own love of comfort,
my own love of prejudge village,

841
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,673
my own prejudice,
my own ways of garnering what I am and 

842
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:28,320
who I feel about myself,
the participant.

843
00:43:28,321 --> 00:43:29,154
Like,
I am a participant in this system in 

844
00:43:30,601 --> 00:43:31,434
these ways.

845
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,150
Yeah.
I'm also kind of,

846
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:36,240
that is a,
um,

847
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,790
in a way we kind of have to keep those 
two things in our head at the same time.

848
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:42,660
Right?
So we are,

849
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,230
we are people,
we are flawed individuals and we live in

850
00:43:46,231 --> 00:43:48,150
a capitalist society and we,
you know,

851
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,440
we want houses and we wants things that 
are going at my,

852
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,530
my w,
you know,

853
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,410
we want things,
we want comfort.

854
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,143
And my personal feeling about all that 
stuff is do what you have to do so long 

855
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:04,690
as you don't screw anybody else over.
Um,

856
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,633
you know,
if you can point to a time or a place 

857
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:08,910
where I've actually done something,
you know,

858
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:14,190
actually made somebody else poorer or 
worse off than that's one thing.

859
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,710
But that,
um,

860
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,770
you giving away your money doesn't 
change capitalism.

861
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,020
It just makes you poorer.
And,

862
00:44:22,021 --> 00:44:23,240
um,
uh,

863
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,070
I'm interested in changing the system,
not in,

864
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,390
you know,
seeing you in,

865
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,010
um,
uh,

866
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,260
seeing you in,
in poverty,

867
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:32,423
but also just kind of linking where we 
are as individuals to kind of more 

868
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:38,670
collective things.

869
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,113
And this comes back to the gun thing 
actually and and children in particular 

870
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:48,141
that we talk about personal 
responsibility a lot with guns,

871
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:49,524
but there is also with children,
particularly a collective 

872
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:55,110
responsibility.
That's why we have sexual services,

873
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:57,600
child protection services,
child courts,

874
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,463
all that kind of thing.
There was an awareness that they're not 

875
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:05,541
fully responsible and so there is this 
general way of understanding things.

876
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:13,131
I think that like I am not a state,
I am not a society.

877
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,930
I'm an individual.
So when people say,

878
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:16,764
well say someone did that to your kid,
wouldn't you want to just go out and 

879
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:20,940
murder them?
So yeah,

880
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:21,803
I would.
That's why I'm glad there's a code 

881
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:27,510
because I know want to be responsible 
for kind of,

882
00:45:27,511 --> 00:45:28,344
you know,
how we respond to these things 

883
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,910
personally that I would,
I would rather,

884
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:37,911
there was some independent reasons why 
of doing these things and I guess,

885
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,970
yeah,
we all have certain privileges.

886
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:45,390
We live in the west,
we all have certain privileges,

887
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:46,224
so we have to be aware of them,
but we can't let us have them disable 

888
00:45:50,621 --> 00:45:51,454
us.
What can we learn from the particular 

889
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:54,804
distinctions between these two,
the studies of violence that you've 

890
00:45:57,511 --> 00:46:00,630
undertaken in the United States and 
England?

891
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,750
What are the differences say about those
countries do you think?

892
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,060
Well,
um,

893
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,050
so I've been doing a series this year on
knife crime in Britain,

894
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:11,800
could be on the blind,
um,

895
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:15,980
looking at tracking over deaths of kids 
19 and under,

896
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,010
um,
from um,

897
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,870
um,
from stabbings and um,

898
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,870
which kind of mirrors in a way what,
what was happening in the states.

899
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,450
Uh,
I think the broad,

900
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:31,343
the broad lesson that you,
one can learn from path of those things 

901
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,303
is that,
is that there are reasons why this 

902
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:38,694
happens that are not,
people kind of feel like this falls out 

903
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:45,690
of the blue sky or dark sky,
that kind of,

904
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:47,010
it's evil.

905
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,000
It's,
you know,

906
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,880
bad people is,
and it's really,

907
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,420
you know,
in America if you take segregation,

908
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,830
poverty,
racism,

909
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:01,590
kind of underinvestment in,
in communities,

910
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:06,650
and then you put on the top of that big 
pile of tinder I violent weapon that can

911
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:08,064
kill people really easily.
What do you think's going to happen in 

912
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:12,140
Britain?
Um,

913
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:16,500
if you cut child and adolescent mental 
health services,

914
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,220
youth services,
um,

915
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:21,740
slash c,
um,

916
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:22,643
you know,
social services through kind of a local 

917
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:26,940
councils,
um,

918
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,130
then what do you think is going to 
happen?

919
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,123
Something's going to give,
but of course it's going to be the 

920
00:47:31,901 --> 00:47:35,500
poorest people.
It we're to suffer.

921
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:40,830
So there are a nobody,
I I s the last piece I did for the,

922
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,003
um,
beyond the blight series was an 

923
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:44,464
interview with the mother of a child who
had killed someone who'd been sentenced 

924
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,880
and she had written to her mp saying,
please save my child.

925
00:47:55,390 --> 00:48:00,390
She had taken parenting courses.
She had told a local social services,

926
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,830
either my child's going to be killed,
all this going to be a body bag.

927
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,240
She had asked them to move her because 
their child was struggling.

928
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,180
She had tried all of this stuff and what
she said was,

929
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:19,150
did my child did the local authority,
a knife in my child's hand.

930
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:23,530
Now he's responsible for what he did.
They don't try everything I could.

931
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:26,200
Yes.
And where we found yes.

932
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,213
And it's possible to keep all of those 
things in your head at one time that 

933
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,870
everybody has to take responsibility for
what they do.

934
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,440
And that includes us collectively as a 
society.

935
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:39,543
I understand we've been overly biasing 
towards narratives that are about 

936
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,353
individualism.
And the reason I think we're so 

937
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:48,610
susceptible to that idea is because we 
live in our own heads,

938
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,860
we are individuals.
So that seems where people go,

939
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,690
you know,
oh well he did each and at that made you

940
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:53,351
think,
Oh yeah,

941
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:54,184
oh I'm me and I didn't do it.
There's immediately a sort of a fertile 

942
00:48:56,591 --> 00:48:59,790
ground for that to flourish in and 
they're almost,

943
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:03,040
it requires of us a little more work to 
see us,

944
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:03,933
the invisible Fred's between us,
the collective connections that our 

945
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:12,220
culture is made up of.
And if that story is not articulated and

946
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:14,260
beautifully told,
we forget it.

947
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,273
Cause it's almost like I feel like I've 
return like [inaudible] to the my self 

948
00:49:19,271 --> 00:49:24,271
as an individually driven on my own.
Those kinds of psychological memes,

949
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,810
like they're,
they're effective in my own Ed.

950
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,973
So it,
it takes an effort to feel like I'm 

951
00:49:31,841 --> 00:49:34,900
connected,
I'm part of this and we are all one.

952
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:35,734
It's a difficult story.
So it's in a way we live in a culture 

953
00:49:38,531 --> 00:49:42,010
that tells us the stories about 
ourselves that are the worst stories and

954
00:49:42,011 --> 00:49:44,350
neglects to tell us the positive 
stories.

955
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,940
And it seems like,
I mean,

956
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:47,800
Gosh,
economics is one level of it,

957
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:48,491
but I,
you know,

958
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:51,610
sometimes I wonder if there is more than
just entropy or uh,

959
00:49:51,611 --> 00:49:52,444
you know,
like inertia at work behind it because 

960
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:54,844
it seems like such malice.
It seems like it can this be as simple 

961
00:49:57,611 --> 00:49:58,444
as the attainment of profit behind all 
of this suffering behind all of this 

962
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:03,100
pain is just people going,
no,

963
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:03,371
no,
no.

964
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:04,204
It's better off to sell stuff if people 
think they're individuals and that 

965
00:50:06,281 --> 00:50:07,114
they've got buy things to feel better 
and if their lives about it's their 

966
00:50:08,951 --> 00:50:11,470
fault that go after we will use.

967
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,770
It's,
um,

968
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,940
it's,
it's more about neglect.

969
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:21,750
It's more about these going back to the 
black marks mammoth thing,

970
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:25,590
these people don't matter what happens 
to these people,

971
00:50:25,591 --> 00:50:27,560
it doesn't matter.
Um,

972
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:28,603
uh,
and if we can convince ourselves that 

973
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:35,450
these people don't matter and what 
Hamson doesn't matter,

974
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,460
then all sorts of things come into play.
And so what this,

975
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,950
what we've been trying to do beyond the 
blade and why I was so keen to interview

976
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:44,493
them,
the mother of the boy who killed was to 

977
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,270
make the point that in order to solve 
these things,

978
00:50:50,271 --> 00:50:52,850
we have to humanize everybody.
We actually,

979
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,850
we have to,
it's not a killer.

980
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:58,580
It's a child who killed,
is a child who did something monstrous.

981
00:50:58,581 --> 00:51:01,070
He's not a monster.
That people are more than their crimes.

982
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:05,450
That in a world where some of these 
people,

983
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,730
anybody in ms story isn't human.

984
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:12,260
All sorts of things are possible to 
neglect,

985
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,333
to forget to dismiss.
And so we have to start off from the 

986
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:21,290
basis that even the people who are doing
things that we hate Nancy's,

987
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,320
we're humans.
And that actually is the problem.

988
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:27,580
What are they not human?
We could plug that somewhere else that,

989
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,440
that period and all of the other 
periods,

990
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:32,640
it was similar.
It was Armenian genocide.

991
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:36,020
It doesn't matter.
They were committed by human beings.

992
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:37,363
That's what scary about it.
Once we start pretending that they're 

993
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:44,300
not human beings,
then we found a way to kind of um,

994
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,420
uh,
park this stuff somewhere else.

995
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,410
So people do,
people can do very bad things.

996
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:53,900
They can also do brilliant,
wonderful,

997
00:51:53,901 --> 00:51:56,040
beautiful things.
And um,

998
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:59,120
um,
either way and,

999
00:51:59,121 --> 00:52:01,010
and,
and then comes the problem of saying,

1000
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:01,821
well,
Nelson Mandela,

1001
00:52:01,821 --> 00:52:02,654
he was a saint or saying that people are
doing wonderful things and sanely now 

1002
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:08,480
the still they're people,
they're people.

1003
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:13,780
And that is a very inspiring notion 
because it means it could be you,

1004
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,380
it could be you doing that.

1005
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:16,330
Yes,
yes.

1006
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:17,163
I see the necessity of it.
And I see now I understand your 

1007
00:52:19,031 --> 00:52:21,280
commitment to truth because you're 
within truth.

1008
00:52:21,281 --> 00:52:24,310
There is complexity.
And in the complexity though,

1009
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,580
there is a revelation if you sort of 
finish off,

1010
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:28,443
uh,
if you allow the threat to finish where 

1011
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:30,604
the conventional narrative ends,
then you are didn't your denying 

1012
00:52:34,001 --> 00:52:34,834
yourself truth.
Just beyond that is where the 

1013
00:52:36,491 --> 00:52:37,324
explanation is.
If you allow the story of it was this 

1014
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:41,470
time of night in this community with 
this,

1015
00:52:41,471 --> 00:52:44,830
within this demographic,
then you are not participate in,

1016
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,750
in real truth there.
I understood,

1017
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,180
I understand the importance and 
significance of that.

1018
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:54,390
I also recognize how important it is too
broad to firstly,

1019
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,700
I dunno,
identify different stories.

1020
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:58,811
Uh,
I think,

1021
00:52:58,811 --> 00:53:00,100
uh,
another relatively recent,

1022
00:53:00,101 --> 00:53:02,080
an interesting example where that was 
it,

1023
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:02,973
when was that?
There was sort of the riots around that 

1024
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,240
police custody,
murder sort of around north London.

1025
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:09,310
Oh yeah.
That old though.

1026
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,144
The peculiar way they sort of bloomed 
like some sort of continuum of 

1027
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:17,470
consciousness was of regionally 
awakening what they do.

1028
00:53:17,471 --> 00:53:20,380
What did you think about that,
those disturbances?

1029
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,260
Well then no,
far from,

1030
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,040
uh,
where I live and um,

1031
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,440
you know,
I s I thought,

1032
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:29,680
well,
yes,

1033
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:33,430
you know,
a young person has been killed and uh,

1034
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:38,010
what kind of world would it be where 
people were angry about that?

1035
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:43,610
And you can try and manage the anger,
but the real way to kind of,

1036
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,320
I mean,
there are two things that you have to do

1037
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:47,154
to actually confronted.
The first is tell the truth about how 

1038
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:52,170
that happened to make sure somebody is 
accountable.

1039
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,480
And then the second is make sure it 
never happens again.

1040
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:58,100
And anything short of that,
well one dissipate their anger,

1041
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,120
but people have a right to be angry.
Not least when people,

1042
00:54:03,121 --> 00:54:03,954
you know,
there is this sense whether it's 

1043
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,910
[inaudible] or or something like this,
it's like,

1044
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:11,070
well that's not a way to kind of,
you know,

1045
00:54:11,071 --> 00:54:12,600
saw that out,
you know,

1046
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:13,703
writes a letter to your mp or what,
when people feel that system has failed 

1047
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:22,521
them and that it didn't just fail them 
like our now you know,

1048
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,530
it's going to be another week before you
know,

1049
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,170
my,
my toilet's fixed.

1050
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,310
If found them in a way that meant 
somebody died,

1051
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,773
that it was existential,
somebody died or in case of grant from 

1052
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:37,584
loss of people dying,
then anger is a very least you can 

1053
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:43,850
expense.
And um,

1054
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:47,370
um,
there is some sense for those people who

1055
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:50,310
could never imagine that this could be 
them,

1056
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:56,780
that there is some sense of decorum 
missing some sense of propriety.

1057
00:54:59,401 --> 00:55:03,920
And you know,
I'm always struck by remembering Michael

1058
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,870
Heseltine's pamphlet.
I know you didn't see that coming.

1059
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:11,871
Did Michael Heseltine's report after the
IC one riots were,

1060
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,033
which was entitled?
It took her a riot and he's making the 

1061
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:18,930
point.
Yeah,

1062
00:55:18,931 --> 00:55:23,931
I know.
Weird that like what else would you have

1063
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:25,104
listened to?
These people have been saying all sorts 

1064
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,950
of things for all this amount of time 
and nothing's happened.

1065
00:55:31,951 --> 00:55:32,784
So what if not days,
I don't think this was entirely his 

1066
00:55:35,971 --> 00:55:36,804
argument,
but it took this for you to pay 

1067
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:42,820
attention and um,
um,

1068
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:46,560
as society as to ask yourself when these
things blow up.

1069
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,810
And I said,
well you know,

1070
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:49,644
we have to kind of get back to normal.
We have to get beano Cole Cole's for 

1071
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:58,821
calm cause it was cold for calm and it's
like how come can you be when people are

1072
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:00,054
being shot dead in the street?
How come can you be when people are 

1073
00:56:02,731 --> 00:56:03,564
being made about the state?
What kind of piece existed before these 

1074
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:10,980
rise?
I'm sure you've felt very peaceful,

1075
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:15,390
but I don't feel peaceful if I think 
that my child to be one of those.

1076
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,920
And there is coming back to the book.
There is this sense from that,

1077
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,940
that letter,
the woman who kind of wrote,

1078
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:22,400
you know,
to send me Brian died.

1079
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,920
This could not be my child.
This could not be me.

1080
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,460
I cannot imagine I single way in a world
in which this could be me.

1081
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:33,310
So this is happening to a different 
species.

1082
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:34,813
This is like in James Baldwins phrase 
about or at least analysis of the 

1083
00:56:38,781 --> 00:56:43,010
creation of taxonomies,
the necessary other that if you can have

1084
00:56:43,011 --> 00:56:43,844
a demonstrable you different and uh,
hopefully visually different other then 

1085
00:56:47,691 --> 00:56:48,590
there's a sense that,
oh,

1086
00:56:48,591 --> 00:56:49,424
I'm not culpable,
but like it doesn't require such vivid 

1087
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:52,424
demonstration.
Like I know the way that I think of 

1088
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,740
people that are a rough sleepers as,
oh,

1089
00:56:57,741 --> 00:56:59,960
that's not me.
And I was like,

1090
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,580
that couldn't be me.
Oh.

1091
00:57:01,581 --> 00:57:02,414
Like I said,
once you recognize that these 

1092
00:57:03,471 --> 00:57:06,380
distinctions are merely superficial 
stories,

1093
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,260
veneers over the truth,
suddenly we are all vulnerable.

1094
00:57:09,261 --> 00:57:11,810
Suddenly it's all of our children.
Suddenly we're all at risk.

1095
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:12,733
Suddenly change becomes an absolute 
necessity within which we must all 

1096
00:57:15,951 --> 00:57:18,890
participate.
And I really appreciate the way that you

1097
00:57:18,891 --> 00:57:19,724
tell stories.
And the way that you communicate for 

1098
00:57:21,081 --> 00:57:26,081
aluminate in through truth ideas that 
may otherwise not have been revealed.

1099
00:57:26,631 --> 00:57:27,464
So I'm very grateful.
Thank you for coming on under the skin 

1100
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:29,744
mate.
Well for having me.

1101
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:30,800
It's good.
Good show.

1102
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:33,500
Wasn't it splintered?
Nice one.

1103
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,363
We are,
you've got mark [inaudible] before we 

1104
00:57:35,361 --> 00:57:36,710
go,
as well as your own book.

1105
00:57:36,711 --> 00:57:37,544
What other books would you recommend or 
sometimes we ask people to recommend a 

1106
00:57:39,651 --> 00:57:42,230
few books that we should read.
Um,

1107
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:43,320
uh,
I've

1108
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,720
just been reading no is not enough by 
Naomi Klein,

1109
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,420
which I think she's been on the show.
She's good.

1110
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,820
No is not enough.
Um,

1111
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,540
um,
copy of that book from the ground around

1112
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:55,720
roads,
um,

1113
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:58,860
by Colson Whitehead,
which is a brilliant book about,

1114
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,290
um,
a abolitionist.

1115
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:02,550
It's a,
it's a novel,

1116
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,050
uh,
which is,

1117
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,760
um,
which is,

1118
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:10,290
which is really good if you've got kids 
under the age of about four,

1119
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,330
so much.
I really like.

1120
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:13,403
It's just a story about this little kid 
and everybody's coming around because 

1121
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,900
they're having a surprise party for his 
dad and it's kind of every kind of slice

1122
00:58:21,901 --> 00:58:25,770
of kind of Caribbean life,
I think in amount of salaries.

1123
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,250
Uncle dd looks like a baby player and 
his Auntie,

1124
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:30,413
whatever,
who looks like she probably works in 

1125
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:34,644
local government and he's got two hours 
and one's really fat and one's really 

1126
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:39,060
skimming and then his mom.

1127
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,440
Anyway,
let me start,

1128
00:58:40,441 --> 00:58:42,450
comes home from the office and they will
have a big pies.

1129
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,291
It's good.
I mean,

1130
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:44,850
I did not ruin the plot there,
Gary.

1131
00:58:44,851 --> 00:58:46,550
Yeah,
it was quite a lot about Simon.

1132
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:49,590
Yeah,
well the kids ended up going to bed.

1133
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,580
They go,
I'm going to be analyzing the next week,

1134
00:58:51,581 --> 00:58:53,280
so I'm pretty sure this is subtext to 
that.

1135
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,360
Thanks.
Thanks very much,

1136
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:58,830
Gary here another day in the death of 
America.

1137
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,410
That's out now here I've read it.
I like the,

1138
00:59:01,411 --> 00:59:02,244
you've got these air,
1950s white people in the cafe got coke 

1139
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:08,170
or shout because as I said,
very clear semiotic indicator there.

1140
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,510
Call it.
Cheers,

1141
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,250
mate.
Thank you.
