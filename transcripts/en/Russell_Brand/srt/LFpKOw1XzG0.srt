1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,480
[inaudible]

2
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,450
not under the skin with Russell brand.
My guest today is Frankie Boyle.

3
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:31,111
Frankie,
I'm really,

4
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:33,270
really happy to have you on the show.
I love you a bit.

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,253
I think I told you in our email exchange
that I saw a sensitivity in you that 

6
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,164
much belied and contradicted your public
persona even when you were sort of more 

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,430
[inaudible] than me in the public 
sphere.

8
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:50,190
I thought there's something about that 
man is incredibly sensitive and tender,

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,540
so this is a suppose and disarming 
introduction is what I'm doing I think.

10
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,920
I think it's pretty close to see who's 
most of telephone from the head by head.

11
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,380
Yeah.
I know with both had our fair share.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,650
Heavenly of public vilification.
How do you do,

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,520
do you feel like that you,
now that you're back on,

14
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,470
I mean do you still consider yourself to
be back in the mainstream television?

15
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:10,950
Not me.

16
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,910
No,
not taller.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,060
Considered myself to be like less secure
than ever.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,110
What did you mean that emotionally and 
personally or professionally or both but

19
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:19,944
also professionally you just sort of 
think the minute you're kind of out and 

20
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:25,800
doing stuff in a very can amend stream 
field,

21
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,220
the minute you step out say what's 
acceptable,

22
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,054
you would just be completely destroyed.
So I feel like I'm kind of dancing on 

23
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:36,510
the edge of a cliff or bet you feel that
day when you're doing something like the

24
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,020
autopsy or tv autopsy your are you 
centering yourself?

25
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:40,854
Cause I had it for example,
that monologue you did about threes in 

26
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:45,570
May on in fact a cliff edge and the 
gail,

27
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:47,040
I thought one of the things I've had,
my bad,

28
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:47,874
you're right in is the poetry and your 
succinctness it conjuring images that 

29
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:55,620
are humorous.
I potent and I've sort of thing.

30
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,483
Oh that will stick.
That'll bark people that that has been 

31
00:01:58,921 --> 00:01:59,754
said about him but now you do you find,
are you centering the saying you're 

32
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:04,710
dancing on a cliff edge,
do you feel it was that self censorship?

33
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,663
I don't do it,
but like there does it for me usually 

34
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,140
and a out like writing for the Guardian 
as well.

35
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:12,100
It just ended up being like a real 
horrific,

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,953
just trying to get prey common or garden
stuff in there because I think if the 

37
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:23,130
education can education system can uh,
please select for conformity.

38
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,020
You know,
that idea that you know,

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,420
by the time you reached the top in any 
institution,

40
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:31,140
you've already gone through so many pre 
selections for your conformist while you

41
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:33,290
fill in the test where you turn up to 
skill every day,

42
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,843
that everybody's a conformist,
where like sometimes in entertainment I 

43
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,574
think that can appease leg for neurosis.
So like if you're kinda going through 

44
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,810
several peoples what he's about,
what other people might think,

45
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,033
and by the time you were scrapped riches
and they're just kind of freaking out 

46
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:51,120
about nothing.
Yes,

47
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:51,954
I think you're right about that.
But there is a degree of neuroses and 

48
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:58,290
indeed sensitivity that is deeply 
prohibitive.

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,040
But there's so about like the

50
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,873
creative process that is,
it requires like a connection to what 

51
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:04,534
you actually believe.
When we were corresponding for a little 

52
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:09,820
while and email like I'm member,
we talked briefly about the idea,

53
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,693
like my somewhat more romantic idea of 
the comedian is shaman and like 

54
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:18,910
accessing new realms of consciousness.
And you said something about,

55
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,220
um,
that there was something about that,

56
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:22,054
about describing of a world that you 
felt was somewhat dangerous and that 

57
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:25,774
what needed to be done with the frosted 
describe accurately the world are 

58
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:29,464
actually in.
Was that just the past in Forza 

59
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,560
philosophy?
Philosophical mainstay?

60
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,810
Yeah,
totally.

61
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,450
I mean,
I,

62
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,850
I think there's,
in some of the most interesting ideas,

63
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,220
there's a lot of,
um,

64
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,860
there's a lot of danger isn't there?
The,

65
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,490
you know,
shamanism and,

66
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,130
um,
particularly quite shamans.

67
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,080
There's a lot of kind of,
Eh,

68
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,973
how'd you mean?
There's that whole thing of like 

69
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:52,094
cultural erasure and stuff like that.
And us just being at that as we see it 

70
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:57,284
at the top of some tree where every,
every idea in existence is part of our 

71
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:03,180
mid board for our personal philosophy.
Can,

72
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:04,070
it dictates against them

73
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,933
the standard stuff.
So do you mean white there as a synonym 

74
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,650
for power?
That it was sort of like a there that we

75
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:13,040
are,
we are selecting for like all culture is

76
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:13,874
a mood board from which were selected 
strands and obfuscating or ignoring 

77
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,590
their cultural origins.

78
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,853
Yeah.
I almost think you don't need to use 

79
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,600
white as a synonym for power justice.
It's a Nim.

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,540
Yeah.
Ah,

81
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,443
yeah.
I see this interesting thing with it at 

82
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:33,480
the minute and we're no,
some people talking about Ah,

83
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,510
you know,
you don't,

84
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,350
you're not white privilege doesn't 
really exist.

85
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,180
You know what if you're,
you know,

86
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:40,014
a white guy who was born in this century
action and all that kind of stuff and 

87
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:45,900
you think the thing about real 
oppression is those people don't need to

88
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,520
fantasize.
You know,

89
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,700
if you really oppressed to that whole 
thing of like,

90
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,810
you know,
you get that from,

91
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,660
from white people,
particularly white people was a platform

92
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,730
and they're sort of going,
well,

93
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,250
what if it's a paralyzed white guy and 
he works for Oprah?

94
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,520
You know,
you just know like,

95
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,440
Whoa,
if you know,

96
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:02,274
if you were black,
you wouldn't need to make a fantasy to 

97
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,004
have your depression.
I know you would just go out on the 

98
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,640
weekend.
I started the taxi,

99
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,800
you know,
I'm an empty white,

100
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,653
white people come up with imaginary 
oppresses like the Illuminati and you 

101
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:15,450
know,
we've got to,

102
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,310
we've got to create something because we
don't,

103
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,870
we don't have it in the same way.

104
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,860
Is your general worldview optimistic?
Frankie?

105
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:23,694
What's that happened to you after like 
working in media fire don't for maybe 

106
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:27,324
it's 15 years.
Is it that you've been doing this kind 

107
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:32,640
of stuff like that it still feel 
positive and optimistic about change?

108
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,713
I think you solved domestic but most 
people heat in it would think it's 

109
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,490
incredibly depressing.
It was mistake.

110
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,230
I could lay it on you quick quickly.
[inaudible] I think like um,

111
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,113
maybe a whole reality is like a math for
a and the materialism and 

112
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:51,924
commodification are mine.
Keynes way of trying to express in 

113
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:59,640
metaphor the fact we are trapped in 
motto that we are sped.

114
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:00,474
It now has to live in Martin and die and
go through all that kind of stuff and 

115
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:04,274
perhaps the,
perhaps the actual facts of life is 

116
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:08,354
we've constructed it.
I simply sort of metaphoric responds to 

117
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:11,930
that.
And there's some people may think that's

118
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:16,130
incredibly depressing bias.
I think of it like when I was a teacher,

119
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:18,560
I did teach her training for bet.
It was an alcoholic.

120
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,060
I remember like seeing my arm writing on
a chalkboard one day and thinking,

121
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,440
Oh fuck,
I'm a teacher,

122
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,543
my teachers and I almost had an body 
experience and could see myself doing 

123
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,050
this thing that's,
I've got to,

124
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,090
I've got to go to this job.
You know?

125
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,400
And that's when I started doing comedy 
and I almost think,

126
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,230
oh,
metaphor of existence,

127
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,250
materialism is sort unsurvivable that we
have to go over it.

128
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,540
That was sort of almost half to 
transcend mater.

129
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,030
So I think that's a really positive 
thing.

130
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,220
Yes,
yes,

131
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,113
I understand.
So in this sort of transcend ben or 

132
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:52,660
moment there at the chalkboard art 
teacher training,

133
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:53,494
you add a pithany,
which I've heard described as the 

134
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:59,320
revelation of essence.
Suddenly the essence becomes plain tee.

135
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,780
They all know that that's a teacher's 
arm.

136
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,643
I'll know it's all.
So Maya on where they are one and the 

137
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:07,210
same thing.
I liked this idea,

138
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,163
the on some level we are conscious that 
we are spirit traps in Matt and 

139
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:13,300
materialism is merely the metaphorical 
expression of this.

140
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,730
One of the things that I get 
continually,

141
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:16,570
um,
what I want to say,

142
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:18,820
frustrated by irritate by an almost,
I'm on the,

143
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,940
uh,
on the precipice of a hysterical toddler

144
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,774
tantrum about is that invoke comments.
The left lacks a kind of mythic 

145
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:28,354
imagination that in opposing austerity 
there's a kind of an austerity of a 

146
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,160
room.
I would want to say vision that it seems

147
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:41,161
sometimes a little bit flat and a little
bit droning the for me,

148
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:42,784
if,
if we're just talking about your 

149
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,100
transactions between bureaucracies and 
different type of imagination,

150
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,200
then what is the point?
I want some vivid,

151
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,063
lucid dream.
I want people to talk about different 

152
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:53,824
realms.
I want basically to take Ios Iosk and 

153
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,880
experience machine elves dabbling with 
layers of reality,

154
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:01,714
but I can't drink or take drugs.
So I caught so it's no longer open to 

155
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:04,720
me.

156
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,441
Black.
I agree.

157
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:06,640
Birds,
there's also this thing for,

158
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:07,474
it's like sometimes that slightly 
humorless leftist thing also turns 

159
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:12,394
itself to critique.
Oh the other people's attempts to find 

160
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:17,320
narratives and metaphors and things that
resonate with people.

161
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,870
So it's okay to be boring but to sit 
there and go,

162
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,460
I didn't like that one.
Well we don't just try it.

163
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,533
I think metaphors can be incredibly 
powerful site in the 1968 riots in 

164
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:29,014
France.
That was partly to do with society of 

165
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:33,520
the spectacle and get the ball and all 
his slogans were choked on the walls and

166
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:34,130
stuff like that

167
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,930
just exploded because you do know a bit 
more about that cause I'm into that.

168
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:41,270
I think that [inaudible] I'm into him 
cause he said one thing I read about him

169
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,104
the other day was saying that the media 
and technology at south deeply 

170
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:49,781
corporatized the old data within it is 
necessarily imbued with,

171
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:50,684
it's your agenda and you can see that in
social media that even if people are 

172
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:55,860
sort of going,
hey that's me in this square and riot,

173
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,720
the an advert for trainers may very well
accompany and the he's,

174
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,733
he's procube age than the medium is 
prohibited by its origins and by its 

175
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:05,424
ownership.

176
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,400
So has it.
Hazel was saying was like this bag,

177
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:08,390
the cool,
um,

178
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:09,224
as you know,
when it says just the site that you can 

179
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:14,170
escape the spectical so every ton,
and even that's what we're doing,

180
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:18,200
talk hummus is high in this back corner.
Podcasters book ended by adverts.

181
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,780
He would love that.
Yeah.

182
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,303
Yeah.

183
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,141
He signed that.
They'd be,

184
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:26,820
it's inescapable that our role while 
we're at work,

185
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:27,654
we are workers when we're at home with 
consumers with designated roles that 

186
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:33,750
prevent us from having an authentic 
interaction with reality,

187
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,520
an authentic experience of ourselves.
So don't you like it?

188
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,453
It's interesting for me to watch from 
the outside how your role at least 

189
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:44,940
externally just as a fan and a consumer 
of your work is like,

190
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:45,541
it seemed like,
oh,

191
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,730
frankie boyle initially is this mood 
like sort of a fella.

192
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,713
There's making shocking joke working 
class Scottish person making sort of 

193
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,070
pre,
uh,

194
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,050
would want to say,
see hearing jokes,

195
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,333
sacred cows to topics and all that.
And that seems to be a reemergence of 

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,850
political commentary,
uh,

197
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,860
as a sensitivity and an a real depth of 
analysis and deep cultural understanding

198
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,200
of you.
On the gone,

199
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,063
some sort of personal epiphany,
or have you always been like this and 

200
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:14,790
just felt emboldened more recently to 
express yourself more truthfully?

201
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,470
Oh,
I think I've always been like late us,

202
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,430
but it's like you will never see little 
fragments of it slit most people,

203
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:23,010
if we think about how we relate to 
things,

204
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:23,844
so I was reading an article yesterday or
start to read an article by Roger 

205
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:26,900
mcguinn turf.
So,

206
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,570
so regimen golfs on the Guardian website
as I fucking hate vagifem of golf.

207
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,850
And I started to redesign a call and I 
thought to myself,

208
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:36,670
wait a minute,
what should I actually been to this guy?

209
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,930
And I think it seemed like reading some 
poems on a children's show 20 years ago,

210
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,740
if I was totally honest with myself,
just so dead.

211
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,583
It isn't an intellectual exercise.
I didn't like his glasses and he seemed 

212
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:48,304
a bit smug.
That's sort of the level that most 

213
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:51,910
people relate to you.
And to be honest,

214
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:54,340
if you ask most people to relate to you 
more than that,

215
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:56,980
you're a bit of an egotist and people 
are perfectly,

216
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,130
it's perfectly fine that they can hear 
one joke they don't like and hear you.

217
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:01,650
I'm quit don't with that.
Right.

218
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,653
But you know,
I've always done like political stand 

219
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:05,954
up.
It's just like people tend to take it 

220
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:08,950
one way or another.
I don't see,

221
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:11,620
you didn't choose whether his edits and 
they show the best thing.

222
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:11,720
Yeah.

223
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,553
Wow.
So you don't think that you have 

224
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:16,130
essentially change?
Do you think you've been categorized and

225
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:18,620
pieced together differently?
There was a time where it was convenient

226
00:11:18,621 --> 00:11:20,120
there for,
it was frankie boyle,

227
00:11:20,121 --> 00:11:20,954
shocking comic and now it's convenient 
because everyone's a bit more bruised 

228
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:26,870
and anxious to have frankie boyle voice 
of uh,

229
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,090
the off authentic voice of the people.

230
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,130
Well,
maybe I think everybody matures as bad,

231
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,510
but there's,
I mean there's also that thing of,

232
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,690
I think I do tasteless stuff other than 
kind of like offensive stuff.

233
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,560
So it's the idea of like the 
distinction.

234
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,730
What would it,
what would it be?

235
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:44,570
Late we say civility because civility is
a bit of a bore really now it's fine.

236
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:45,404
That bet.
When I first meet people of getting 

237
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:51,350
beyond the niceties to be Beva can a 
chore and then use it later.

238
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,090
Passenger are you doing,
you know,

239
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,233
um,
and I think in society we have that as 

240
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:55,984
well.
But part of the problem is if you're a 

241
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,320
comedian and you've got working class 
background,

242
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,233
you've got regional accent and you're 
dealing with tastelessness taste is a 

243
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:04,960
social marker.
Is he cute?

244
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,140
This is the main social marketing brand.
So then immediately it's like,

245
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,070
oh,
you're just didn't fucking jokes and the

246
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:12,220
Jimmy savile or you know,
and you're like,

247
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:15,070
well I'm not really,
but that's all you can hear.

248
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,010
And I'm sort of time Messiah.
I don't really need the people who,

249
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,860
who can get it to come to the shores.

250
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,903
So you'll say,
and again that that's about like forms 

251
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:26,480
of taxonomy.
That is it,

252
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:29,330
because like if you make a joke about 
Jimmy savile row in a particular accent,

253
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,010
they won't be seen.
Same way as if that,

254
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,110
that same joke was made in a different 
accent where we are.

255
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:34,990
This is interesting cultural critique 
review.

256
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:35,450
It's just,
oh,

257
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,283
that's crass.
And Bolga did you ever see them 

258
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,120
documentaries,
Grayson Perry done about taste and class

259
00:12:41,121 --> 00:12:41,954
and it was actually exemplified 
brilliantly the point that you've just 

260
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:48,110
made because class is quiet class and 
taste.

261
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,840
I suppose whilst they're systems of 
categorization,

262
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:53,450
there's a tendency from be a bit or more
first like,

263
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:54,550
well he sort of said like,
uh,

264
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:54,990
you know,
it was,

265
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,460
it was a rough,
you know,

266
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,120
in some ways it was reductive,
Barbara,

267
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,980
but it was really articulate and clear 
for as far as I could see,

268
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,500
like you been lucky in working class 
communities,

269
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,620
uh,
Welfare's exhibit it.

270
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,291
So like,
you know,

271
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,480
you get Larry Tattoos,
Goldie loud,

272
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:12,450
noisy cars where materialism has to be 
expressed because necessarily because of

273
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:15,650
scarcity middleclass it gets sort of 
like,

274
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:17,110
you know,
it becomes more sophisticated.

275
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,550
The coat and the signals become more 
discreet.

276
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:21,500
It was talking to interior design,
fashion,

277
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,450
all of those things.
And then you send an f class.

278
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,403
People were just like,
dress like I'll ratbags new motto of 

279
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,673
Tech.
Like he was sort of like a polo 

280
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:28,064
mattress.
I make everyone come in some bad old 

281
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:32,000
Volvo or Jim Morris miners with bits of 
wood on them and like,

282
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:33,170
you know,
they were proper,

283
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,480
proper loaded.
And if I see an interesting that,

284
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,314
cause what you know,
that taste is sort of the art of the 

285
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,190
every day,
the stuff that you're wearing,

286
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:42,050
the way that you decorate your house.
Hey,

287
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,993
a great story.
He went around and he's like working 

288
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,013
costs woman's house and it was like,
Oh look a these horse brassieres and 

289
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:51,110
this poor things I need.
It was a very goldie and elegant,

290
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,740
beautiful.
So kitsch display of taste.

291
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,783
And if anybody was interesting how it 
was an almost exact like how you could 

292
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:00,680
move,
oh this is an interesting marker.

293
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,543
This is real.
You can use it as a barometer is 

294
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,650
legitimize me is genuine.
Yeah.

295
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,480
Yeah.
I mean I that's interesting.

296
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,590
Must Watch that.
Um,

297
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,420
I think is w as well.
There's a kind of further stage two,

298
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:12,254
which is if you middle class,
the only the only people who can really 

299
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:15,734
impress other people with purchasing 
power or really poor people and really 

300
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:20,210
rich people.
You know as if you really pair,

301
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:23,690
you get a nice car and if you really 
brought you get and your and your,

302
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:24,524
your social group or impressed.
If you middle class people would pretty 

303
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:28,570
much,
you know,

304
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,290
in a place where they can only express 
themselves through the test.

305
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,420
So you taste becomes incredibly 
important.

306
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,410
And I think when you align that with the
fact that we didn't necessarily,

307
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,244
but it's very difficult to live morally.
So if my taxes are going to bomb sedia 

308
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:44,804
tomorrow,
if my taxes are going to lakeview slide 

309
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,100
front page of the times to the nacs 
death squad,

310
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,500
you know how you I live a moral life or 
maybe it's to my tastes.

311
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,030
You may want to pay lower taxes,
but how on earth are we to fund our sas?

312
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,470
That's exactly what you want.
Correct.

313
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,800
Sas Dead Scott.
No,

314
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:03,311
you're right.
Good.

315
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:05,500
I do a fair enough.
You're quite right now,

316
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:09,130
but I wonder how that relates to what 
you were saying about materialism and an

317
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:13,300
endless commodification and the fact 
that you know,

318
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:14,134
like you're right,
we sit here and we make this pot of 

319
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,040
podcasts now.
Autodidacts though we may be,

320
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,410
we're evidently adept at pontificating 
and doing it as you know,

321
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,370
in some cases on some occasions though,
not this one for a hunt,

322
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:28,240
some living here by like where,
where is it that,

323
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:31,930
where are you resourcing your sense of 
purpose now?

324
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,793
What is it that you won?
What is it that you want to do as a 

325
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:35,590
comic?
Cause like,

326
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,000
uh,
one of the things is I still believe in,

327
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:40,180
I do believe in the possibility of 
change.

328
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:41,014
I believe in a evangelist sees him.
I believe that you can enthuse people 

329
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,880
probably in ways that a rather 
dangerous.

330
00:15:45,881 --> 00:15:46,714
In fact,
when I was just interview Noemi Klein 

331
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,890
there,
she went,

332
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,750
you're this part of bloody problem.
Yeah.

333
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:50,890
You Miss Lunatic.

334
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,133
Well I said,
I think I was struck by this thing at 

335
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:58,780
rate and a grant,
Morrison comic musical one good mine can

336
00:15:58,781 --> 00:15:59,614
make a difference.
Was it just the end of the story 

337
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:01,864
archive.
So I don't think I'm trying to 

338
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:03,784
evangelize to people in general.
It's just that thing of if you do 

339
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,770
something and test in that has meaning 
to,

340
00:16:08,771 --> 00:16:09,604
it can be that one person I could not 
watch and things like Alex Cox is say 

341
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,400
video or maybe drama or whatever you 
called it.

342
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,940
What did he just show his favorite 
movies and BBC two but she wouldn't even

343
00:16:18,941 --> 00:16:19,774
get that kind of thing now.
But like just just things like that had 

344
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:25,780
a big impact on how I see the world,
you know?

345
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:30,550
And if you can change how one person 
sees the white old not might've been off

346
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,183
I suppose.
So I mean if we don't really understand 

347
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:36,900
the true nature of being there so or off
the manifest world,

348
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:42,090
I'm I suppose to sort of even to suggest
that there is a global narrative that we

349
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:44,460
can interact with an intersect with 
Ralph for them.

350
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,520
Sort of endless,
infinite subjectivities,

351
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:48,354
all tangled up and occasional narrative.
Fritz memetically sleeping across the 

352
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,280
Internet.
But I don't know.

353
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:54,114
I suppose like when you find it,
you know when you get an interview bio 

354
00:16:56,611 --> 00:16:58,530
and Jones,
a person who has a much clearer,

355
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,640
I like,
I like,

356
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:02,730
I mean and like I said,
have a clearer idea of narrative to sort

357
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,790
of a traditional idea.
In terms of respect of the left,

358
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,624
how do you think like someone like you 
that's talking about talking about the 

359
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:11,250
spectacle took her out in the nature of 
consciousness,

360
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:12,084
talking about that sort of like,
sometimes you sound a little bit 

361
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:14,904
nihilistic if I may say so.
I think nihilism is quite a positive 

362
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:19,080
thing is it?
Yeah,

363
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,973
go on.

364
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,440
Starts off is like existential nihilism 
of going well.

365
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:23,891
You know,
there's,

366
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:25,780
there's nothing else you might as well 
make.

367
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:27,610
This is as good as you can,
you know?

368
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:30,250
So it's a kind of a branch or 
existential ism.

369
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,940
Originally I think it's only since the 
90s whatever that people have started to

370
00:17:33,941 --> 00:17:35,530
see it as a death cult.

371
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,603
Hmm.
Because it becomes a bit decadent and 

372
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,050
had any stick,
oh well there's no purpose.

373
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:41,330
Why as we'll stick this out and Obama 
and kick that falls over.

374
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,260
Yeah.
I think as well,

375
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,990
you have to be careful about saying,
let's have a narrative and let's have a,

376
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,710
a thing where we,
this is a thing we're like,

377
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,430
Eh,
Alan Mirror the comic book rate,

378
00:17:51,431 --> 00:17:52,264
I'll talks about m r is propaganda for a
state of mind is really [inaudible] 

379
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,450
cool.
Yeah,

380
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,283
it's cool.
But at the same time you've got to be 

381
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,910
careful with that because who do you 
propagandize too?

382
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,970
You don't propagandize Tutti calls.
It's not persuasion.

383
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,860
It places you in a [inaudible] of a week
and a design a narrative that you know,

384
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,800
poor people are going to fan too.
And this is gonna make the world bear.

385
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,860
And the thing with that is people can 
see it if you don't,

386
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,130
if you don't approach it from a 
possession of equality and going,

387
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:21,150
well,
how can I help?

388
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,430
Then you know,
you're,

389
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:26,870
you're suddenly putting yourself in a 
hierarchical possession of hey,

390
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,680
that create a story that's going to 
work,

391
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:29,514
which is what most political parties are
doing and what most really politically 

392
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,760
motivated commentators are doing.
And I always,

393
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,760
I think people see that.
People see that you're trying politicize

394
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:39,594
things.

395
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:44,660
I say I'm a bit grandiose of course.
So like I'm always thinking,

396
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:46,030
oh,
I've got some letter about like,

397
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,903
I don't know Frankie,
if it feels like it's an essential part 

398
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:51,500
of me,
I say sometimes to my counselor.

399
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,700
Like I know it's much of what I do is 
driven by ego.

400
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,310
I know it is,
but it's not only that,

401
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,400
there's something else there is,
I admit that there's the ego.

402
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:03,500
I admit it.
There's the grandiosity I've met,

403
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:04,334
I want the adulation.
And in the past I wanted this more 

404
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:06,920
audit,
uh,

405
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,330
all vs anatomical manifestations,
carnal manifestations.

406
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,550
But like all of,
of all of these,

407
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:15,860
I have now been stripped,
stripped,

408
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:16,694
and landed in domestic city and don't 
think I've ever been happier than being 

409
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:23,830
a father and a partner in a recognizable
sort of way,

410
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,093
but still this yearning.
But it seems to me to be not perhaps 

411
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,640
these systems of categorization and 
these delineations are also arbitrary,

412
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:34,040
but seems to be more than he goes.
Super Ego,

413
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,480
Ego plus something of the mistake,
something of the magical,

414
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,220
something that I'm still craving.

415
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,360
I think you'd find this reductive or 
nihilistic,

416
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:44,740
but it's not,
I think this is a good thing,

417
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,670
you know,
like David Eick cool side too,

418
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,120
right?
So like David Dykes,

419
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,770
so beer in a minute.
Do you know you need things like,

420
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:52,604
because a lot of people are less,
it's a lot of various people in power 

421
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,760
and sort of country western singers for 
somebody who's in our lessons,

422
00:19:57,761 --> 00:19:59,450
right?
I see.

423
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,900
Like David dykes kind of like a 
religious figure.

424
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,420
So he's like a guy who's had a religious
experience,

425
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:06,140
but it's a goalkeeper.
Right?

426
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,130
So you can,
he frames it in a particular way.

427
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,533
I'm an,
it's kind of like the guy who wrote the 

428
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,320
Bible has to believe the metaphor is 
real.

429
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,333
Yeah.
So like that's why it has its power of 

430
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,990
David date has to believe like the,
not ramp tales,

431
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:22,940
but it's a good way of thinking of them 
because they'd behave like red tail.

432
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,330
That's right.
And he does have to,

433
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:25,550
as you say,
because I like you,

434
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,910
you've met everyday,
like haven't you?

435
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,863
Yeah.
Yeah.

436
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,531
We,
we,

437
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,420
I,
I've named several times and I,

438
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:33,540
you know,
I'm obviously fascinated by David dike.

439
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,220
There's that,
like,

440
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,053
I so much voices,
I mean he preempted to hold off the off 

441
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,540
the knee like zones of things that he 
said we're going to happen.

442
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,171
It's not,
not,

443
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:42,270
there's not mince words,
pedophile rings,

444
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,520
you know,
like David,

445
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:45,690
I've said this all be it within the 
entertainment industry.

446
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:46,680
That's he swept paid.
If I run it,

447
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:48,850
it runs deep people in children's homes 
right now.

448
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,713
But yeah,
admittedly that was book ended with a 

449
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:55,150
love of lovely stuff about lizards.
But like I agree with what you're saying

450
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:58,570
is that he's almost like unconscious 
metaphor labor.

451
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:00,060
Cause because David Eick you've pushed,
we've got,

452
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,440
no,
it's funny,

453
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,473
but see,
I think that maybe the messianic thing 

454
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,110
isn't that,
so you have to understand that as a kind

455
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:07,944
of,
oh I can totally change the world by 

456
00:21:08,821 --> 00:21:11,920
doing this,
but to have an actual effect on whatever

457
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,340
as a few thousand people that you 
energize.

458
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,040
Like you have to believe that to be 
true.

459
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,273
Like A,
like a like go see if Hitler suddenly 

460
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,730
had there sort of a moment of going,
oh no,

461
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:24,040
this is mental.
I'm not Hitler.

462
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,520
It'd be meant to be metaphorical.
He's like,

463
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:32,521
no.
Can you see the death camp that they are

464
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:37,190
a bridge too far for you?
Come for all tying.

465
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,790
Let Nick Crow politics played to kill 
it.

466
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,010
We've built one.
Oh No,

467
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:42,844
no,
but perhaps he had a frankie boyle 

468
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,853
moment of looking at his own sieg 
heiling hand and like you writing on a 

469
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:51,610
chalkboard.
I haven't hit La.

470
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,980
What have I done to myself?
You have to believe them.

471
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,843
You know?
Do you have to take the metaphor out of 

472
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,700
it?
It has to be absolute and real.

473
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:01,700
Yeah,
we're not,

474
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,130
we're not sure.
We spoke to David [inaudible].

475
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,700
I am loved so many of the stories and I 
love,

476
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:07,534
like some of them are well vivid.
If you read some of the ones where it's 

477
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:11,620
like Hillary Clinton and going down on 
someone and all of this,

478
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,610
can you fit?
Oh Man.

479
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:14,500
Y'All could go in for this stuff.
You rental it.

480
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:14,850
The Queen

481
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,070
Mother tongue isn't at giant [inaudible]
laser.

482
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,403
[inaudible] there's one that what she 
like changes in the SPEC quite lizards 

483
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:25,630
and stabs the kid up the arse.
Oh.

484
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,410
And it's like just to start over chat,

485
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,420
go from there.
Where are you going to go?

486
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,990
Never explained,
never complained and had that same catch

487
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,790
phrase.
The Queen Mum never apologize.

488
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,640
Never explained or something like that.
Right.

489
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,480
Well surely you should after you've 
taken it.

490
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,563
What?
Bloody Great John Elvino Lizard and 

491
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,863
bumped someone.
Particularly if it's an underage person 

492
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,260
you couldn't possibly have consented 
mom.

493
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,080
Yeah.
Lucky had some rich to some rich,

494
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:51,940
rich stuff in there.
Some interesting things.

495
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:52,960
What did it come in and what else did 
you,

496
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:53,950
what did you think when you met him?

497
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:59,330
And I was like in Portsmith and you've 
just seems like a pretty normal dead,

498
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,160
but there's definitely my ad fan had 
kindergarten backstage.

499
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,263
A Ne was like talking to me and like 
David Aic was stuck behind them in the 

500
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:09,970
corridor looking at me like this bloke's
and nuts.

501
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,460
Let's get away from this Weirdo right 
now.

502
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,520
Then the queen mum bombed another kid.
She was a phoenix.

503
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:21,250
That's one.
Like,

504
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,380
I'm,
yeah,

505
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,340
well I've found fascinating is as like,
you know,

506
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,210
as I say this like,
I wouldn't like to be mean about David.

507
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,280
I was just,
it's so colorful.

508
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:31,800
Some of this imagery that like when I'm 
him,

509
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,630
I was just surprised by actually quite 
how,

510
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,523
how sort of ordinary,
he was almost some drum members that we 

511
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:40,110
watched football with him and we went 
out of the white right.

512
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,123
And like,
I think it was like a FAA Cup games to 

513
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:44,900
sort of like a couple of championship 
level teams and him and his,

514
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:45,980
no,

515
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,401
no,
no.

516
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:47,234
They need to be playing a bit wider and 
so Saturday drinking tea and being sort 

517
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:55,190
of very ordinary while sat on this,
uh,

518
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:56,024
you know,
this sort of great volcano of lucid 

519
00:23:58,701 --> 00:23:59,534
imagery and powerful mythology.
I think it's like the mundane is hugely 

520
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,693
underrated because like,
they've got stuff to sell us all the 

521
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:08,570
time.
Um,

522
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,141
but,
you know,

523
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:10,340
imagine how much better

524
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,240
honey part would be,
uh,

525
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,960
a comprehensive,
you know,

526
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:15,820
if it was just a bad kid,
then his teacher,

527
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:19,810
how many get a bus to the edge of town 
to face some demons or some stuff.

528
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,610
I had just all been a real chore

529
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,620
and then having to top up their oyster 
cards are much better.

530
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,370
You think that he in the ordinary,
in the real,

531
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,000
there could be somehow more potency.
There's really good.

532
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,350
Then those children's books.
Um,

533
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,613
Alan Gardner,
wheatstone of pressing almond and nine 

534
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,200
my right,
there's a trilogy in it.

535
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,980
So first one is called [inaudible] and 
they're all,

536
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,823
but he's,
um,

537
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,993
children,
a brother and sister who are fighting 

538
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:49,060
against this watch.
Um,

539
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,120
and you know,
the go through the old maths,

540
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,120
can I say calls Colin?
Challenges like that and it,

541
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,410
and then he'd rates a sod one like of,
it's 30 years later,

542
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,253
just before he dies.
And it's like the boy grown up going to 

543
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:01,824
his therapist and he's not able to 
really remember any of it and they just 

544
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:05,034
think he was like nuts as a kid and his 
sister disappears at the end of the 

545
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,320
second book,
famous watch.

546
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,660
And he just never really finds out 
whether she dead there,

547
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:14,700
whether she does or if he's just lost 
his mind.

548
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,640
It sort of normalizes it and it was 
great.

549
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,480
It was really good.
Oh,

550
00:25:18,481 --> 00:25:21,020
I'm going to check those out.
I liked that Frankie.

551
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,150
All right,
so let me think about it because I spent

552
00:25:24,151 --> 00:25:26,580
out a little bit while we were talking 
about I can,

553
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:31,240
uh,
became a bit untethered from myself.

554
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,660
So one of the things I had to talk to 
you about,

555
00:25:33,661 --> 00:25:37,710
like on sort of a,
perhaps a more or ordinary level,

556
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,770
these moments of disruption that we seem
to be experiencing that they're sort of,

557
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:41,604
uh,
uh,

558
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,880
the terrorism,
the Grenfell Tower,

559
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,300
which you spoke to own Jones about like,
uh,

560
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,343
what do you,
what do you think is revealed by these 

561
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:54,120
events?
What do you think is becoming a parent?

562
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:56,700
What is becoming manifest?
And it's been previously concealed.

563
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,800
I think people are more widely 
recognized and just high letell.

564
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,903
This system that is supposed to 
nominally care for them can't even be 

565
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:09,494
bothered to pretend.
And for some reason there seems to be a 

566
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,304
deference between a government is 
supposed to pretend to care and a 

567
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:19,130
government that can't even be bothered 
to pretend the care,

568
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,010
you know?
So the idea that the grand for residents

569
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:24,440
got their rent,
the doctored this month for example,

570
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,743
you know the idea they could,
they tried to throw them out of their 

571
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,441
hotel,
you know,

572
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:29,940
they're in a holiday inn somewhere and 
they tried to split them all up and,

573
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,660
and,
and also there's a can immediate lag.

574
00:26:32,661 --> 00:26:34,640
There isn't no.
So they don't know that.

575
00:26:34,641 --> 00:26:37,640
They can't get away with that anymore.
In the days of social media.

576
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,570
They don't know that they can have a 
council meeting.

577
00:26:39,571 --> 00:26:42,380
There isn't film the all because 
everybody's got a camera now,

578
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,950
you know.
So there's,

579
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,990
there's a,
there's two things and I think,

580
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:50,160
which is like social media for which 
alone for a long time is seem to be like

581
00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:53,010
quick can it depressing seesaw of good 
and bad.

582
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:58,050
I seems to be like a net gain in protest
movements.

583
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,401
Um,
and,

584
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:04,401
and just also the fact that we are 
really in classes or are way more out of

585
00:27:05,571 --> 00:27:06,570
touch than we'd imagined.

586
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,260
Yes.
I see.

587
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:09,094
So they sit in a way is like,
is it s a revelationary symbol of joy 

588
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,930
that that brings together numerous 
Fred's this connection,

589
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:17,883
total lack of concern.
And then the unawareness in fact of how 

590
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:21,630
quickly things get changed.
I fought,

591
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,230
one of the things that was notable,
uh,

592
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,103
struck me was the,
on the black sort of a Monday or 

593
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:29,374
whenever our,
after the fire Jeremy Corbyn was on tv 

594
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,743
going,
you know,

595
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,953
repossess ours is give them luxury flat.
And that would have been a couple of 

596
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,070
years ago that would be mental and 
visible.

597
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,720
And then by Thursday,
Friday,

598
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,590
that's what's happening.
So there is it almost that there is a,

599
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,890
there is a necessity to respond to a 
different kind of uh,

600
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,023
discourse.
It's also just like how it's almost 

601
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:53,024
novelistic,
I mean it's how can have cartoonish and 

602
00:27:54,801 --> 00:27:57,630
the whole thing has been so at the head 
of housing,

603
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,040
m Kensington and Chelsea,
Eh,

604
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,080
council is a guy called rock fielding 
mail and it's going to stay down.

605
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,333
But he's like part of this like honesty,
cratic family who his mother is some 

606
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:10,544
kind of modeled happy who ran a couple 
of times and for this party called tree 

607
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:16,394
panning for the national health and try 
and persuade everyone to like tree pine 

608
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:20,864
themselves to drill a hole over here.
The drill to hell in a hand to help you 

609
00:28:23,691 --> 00:28:24,980
relax.
Yeah.

610
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:27,770
So she's good taste sons.
One is rock fielding melon.

611
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:31,550
The can a straight Arrow and then 
there's cause cause it,

612
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,413
cosmo fielding malins done several 
documentaries about acids and they live 

613
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:39,920
in this like Jacobean Mansion.
Right?

614
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:44,450
And it has the Breton or maybe the 
world's largest gravity phone,

615
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,293
tim.
So it has literally this enormous 300 

616
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:52,811
feet high powerful jet of water shooting
up like 24 hours a day.

617
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:53,744
The one thing that could have 
extinguished is in the grains of has an 

618
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,363
ancestral home.

619
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:02,610
If only there was some way,
some way to control the confrontation,

620
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,563
one eyed man would've needed something 
absurd like a gravity defying press 

621
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,640
conference over the solution was laying 
about in their garden.

622
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,713
And the the straight Arrow is the one 
that's called rock melon rock fielding 

623
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,920
Mellon.
Amazing.

624
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,660
Amazing.
So yes,

625
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,503
there's,
it's interesting when you talked before 

626
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:23,880
about like perhaps materialism and 
commodification being some extraordinary

627
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:27,510
metaphor for ourselves,
understanding that we are spirit trapped

628
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:28,344
in matter because more and more I'm 
seeing a kind of dumb poetry in current 

629
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:33,384
affairs.
Like so if we're emblems such as the 

630
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:35,784
tower itself and then sort of Ludicrous 
sub narratives about fountain is in the 

631
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:42,250
garden as if somehow now the is 
appearing

632
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,030
just beneath the veneer of superficial 
reality.

633
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,350
But something ulterior is trying to 
realize itself,

634
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,380
some dreadful beasts slouching towards 
Bethlehem to be born,

635
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,040
but that is there some optimism in this 
lucky in,

636
00:29:59,041 --> 00:29:59,874
in events like this on a sort of,
I don't know frankly this deep into the 

637
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:03,790
conversation,
but on a practical level,

638
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,840
do you think that this could precipitate
change?

639
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,823
Absolutely.
And there's loads of things to be 

640
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:10,324
positive about.
Look at the incompetence of your 

641
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:14,800
enemies.
Look at like the tardy carbonate,

642
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,663
like something make or fallen.
I can of living side I sent out to just 

643
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:25,180
sort of saw cup shrapnel or something 
and he's just,

644
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:28,660
you know,
tied onto a bus and driven at the media.

645
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,730
May Cook Golf.
Um,

646
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,970
borders is like there.
I mean they're just,

647
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,560
they're just saying,
who do we,

648
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:41,250
can we replace this in competent cunt 
with a massive cunt?

649
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:46,810
And all we can do is I can see that 
there's cause for optimism there.

650
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,930
What about you on a personal level?
How has it been you,

651
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:51,764
you all right it happy in there.
You've got love in your life and 

652
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,920
children and stuff.
Hey,

653
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,033
I've got children I've been doing in 
London doing this TV show on BBC two so 

654
00:31:01,211 --> 00:31:02,044
I'm just like,
I'm messing my kids at the moment and 

655
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:08,770
feeling about like how much longer can I
do this?

656
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,800
How long have you had to do so far I've 
been here for like months.

657
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,630
Oh really?
What does it,

658
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,490
it makes you feel what?
A little bit disconnected.

659
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,140
Yeah.
And also it just makes,

660
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:20,710
I think it makes you write in a bit kind
of automatic cars instead of like,

661
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,113
you know,
Oh I really want to say something about 

662
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:24,110
the subject.
You're kind of going to,

663
00:31:24,111 --> 00:31:24,944
I need 10 jokes for this week to try and
get through this thing and get back 

664
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:28,924
home.

665
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,663
Yes.
I say it breaks your relationship or 

666
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,380
fucking be grand for a moment.
With the idea of the mute.

667
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,480
My life has changed a lot,
you know,

668
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:39,820
like sort of,
I felt like when before I would just the

669
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,960
philandering womanizing,
like sort of professional,

670
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:47,080
loose cannon person,
there was sort of no consequence.

671
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:50,410
There was a kind of delicious 
rootlessness accompany though.

672
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:53,440
It was with a deep sense of personal 
despair.

673
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,393
Over the intervening when we,
a hotel I was in would immediately turn 

674
00:31:57,611 --> 00:31:58,444
into sort of a barren multistory car 
park bereft of all life bereft of all 

675
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,054
light.
It was just the trail of underwear 

676
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,610
traipsing out of the door now like they,
you know,

677
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,453
this era is over and I live in,
I mean people I have peace and harmony 

678
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:17,280
and love and all these things that I 
sort of never like in it.

679
00:32:17,281 --> 00:32:18,760
For me,
family was a kind of,

680
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,783
uh,
an idea that was nervous about because 

681
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:21,964
of what the connotations that word had 
because of the one that I've grown up 

682
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,231
with,
you know,

683
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:30,160
and now I'm learning a kind of a new way
of living and one.

684
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:30,994
How'd you,
how'd you feel to them and does that 

685
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:35,830
take you away from that?
I don't like when I,

686
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:38,500
if I go like I'm doing like touring in 
an intelligent way,

687
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:40,430
right?
I do like so free shows a week

688
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,020
and like if I have to stay away,
my girlfriend and my baby and my dog,

689
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,913
all of us go up in a car like traveling.
People might as well have a banjo like 

690
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:53,540
we were sort of like yeah it's a really 
good way of doing it because the center,

691
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:58,070
the nucleus of my life has moved from 
this kind of limitless.

692
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,373
We sort of like driven kind of 
performance ego goal or they was upset 

693
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,393
to you already.
That in itself has been in a woven with 

694
00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:09,320
other stuff to oh no I have a home.
I'm a person.

695
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,070
I'm a

696
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,903
great if you can do that man cause I've 
just had to stop to them cause I did a 

697
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:16,580
50 date to it or something last time.
I just couldn't handle it.

698
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:17,300
It's too much

699
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,260
aren't you?
Were away a lot.

700
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,143
And what happened to you

701
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,240
as she used to weigh too much and 
there's also like you know the thing you

702
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:23,074
get at the moment,
there's a lot of criticism of comedians 

703
00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:25,204
about Oh you,
you want comedy to be a protected space 

704
00:33:27,521 --> 00:33:30,040
and a special place where you can see 
nsn and use.

705
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:34,330
I think it's the fun,
this space away from that in the world.

706
00:33:34,331 --> 00:33:38,230
I mean if I could just stop them fucking
yelling or trying to claim on this stage

707
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,930
are lik explosive sales.
However,

708
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,313
do you know the idea that we have this 
aspirational idea of it's a protected 

709
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:46,660
space,
you know,

710
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,920
just cause you need to think that when 
you're writing but in practice,

711
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,550
you know,
standing up on afraid and I in Blackburn

712
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,940
to people who've been drinking him and 
he stopped drinking it like fucking five

713
00:33:57,941 --> 00:34:01,510
o'clock.
Oh you and your protected space.

714
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,880
Yes.
I see.

715
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,793
And that as a,
aside from that you find it personally 

716
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:08,910
difficult.
Yeah.

717
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:12,330
D M yeah.
Just find it really hard being away from

718
00:34:12,331 --> 00:34:15,360
home for the amount of time.
And also,

719
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,690
I mean I like the [inaudible] tif didn't
stand up so you write a joke,

720
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:20,760
he'd go and try it works is in the 
shore.

721
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:25,140
But the idea of then taking that shore 
and like a hundred times,

722
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,770
I mean as it gets less relevant to you 
in them.

723
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,480
I can't,
I'm never doing it again,

724
00:34:30,481 --> 00:34:31,314
I don't think.

725
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,173
Wow.
Really?

726
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:33,780
He didn't think could do it again.
No.

727
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,570
My technique,
I think he's all right.

728
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:36,880
This is three days a week thing.
I was here.

729
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:37,963
I see how it goes now.
I read both of your biographical books 

730
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,580
or other thing your brother said like,
uh,

731
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,770
you're always going to be worried about 
something.

732
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,820
Even when you're,
like I said,

733
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,620
always be worried about something.
You're worried about something.

734
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:51,320
And even if that thing goes okay,
there'll be a new worry.

735
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:53,310
So basically you're always do white 
about some things.

736
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,750
I didn't like that thought very much and
I've had it myself.

737
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,280
Yeah.
A hierarchy of like what is that we have

738
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:03,370
and all we ever really was replace the 
one at the top.

739
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:03,880
Yep.

740
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,511
Yes.
Yes.

741
00:35:04,511 --> 00:35:05,344
This is jostling league table of angst.
Do you have some kind of like have you 

742
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,070
do think that that sort of dynamic of 
you already life,

743
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:13,690
which seems to have pretty fraught to 
me.

744
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,613
So it sounded like it's quite difficult 
and obviously you were an alcoholic for 

745
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,450
a while or is it the uh,
in,

746
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,353
in,
in this of pop popular style 

747
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,690
understanding of the condition will 
remain one like that.

748
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,570
You don't drink no more tech drugs of 
any kind.

749
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,380
No,
I don't do anything.

750
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,011
No.
Yeah,

751
00:35:27,011 --> 00:35:28,190
me neither.
And let's say like,

752
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,820
what do you like,
how do you find solace?

753
00:35:30,821 --> 00:35:33,010
Have you got some sort of spiritual 
program or something?

754
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,160
No.
African across a decadent to work across

755
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,040
the Dixon can catch about your

756
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,260
work.
I,

757
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,233
I don't really get obsessive about it,
but I just do too much or it did more 

758
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:43,380
than makes me happy.

759
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:48,320
Just that part of that can a Catholic 
guilt thing of,

760
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,011
oh,
that's good.

761
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:49,844
Am I happy?
No,

762
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,590
it did so much.
Might not be that's,

763
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,000
that's what it,
who's supposed to be.

764
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,850
Yes.
All right.

765
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:58,900
Do you know what you mean by that?
I didn't know how you got lack of vision

766
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:01,620
for what you want to do.
Does it,

767
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:02,883
do you see yourself becoming more 
involved in like more directly involved 

768
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:06,964
in activism?
Do you see yourself ever wanting to be 

769
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:09,004
in a position of any authority or power?
Does that idea sort of soup simply be 

770
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,323
unpleasant here?

771
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,480
Oh No,
it seems incredibly unpleasant.

772
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,950
Uh,
you've heard that thing?

773
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:18,590
Um,
the once and future king t h wait,

774
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,660
no,
but I mean it's like there's Keds Berkey

775
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:22,370
but king asa,
but it's like,

776
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,930
it seemed as a 12 year olds or 
something.

777
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:24,764
That's where they took him,
the sod and this door and Cuttin from 

778
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:27,834
and kind of where they took monty python
and the holy grail they expect from it 

779
00:36:31,431 --> 00:36:32,550
as well.
But it's all access.

780
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,530
There's fairly jolly can a kid's book 
Cubo Eh,

781
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,600
you know,
young arts and meet Marilyn and they,

782
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,391
they,
you know,

783
00:36:38,391 --> 00:36:40,910
the spins and fork stands on a table and
all that kind of stuff.

784
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,193
And then a few chapters,
then we start to get bit darker in 

785
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:45,240
Maryland.
Tons.

786
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,570
I'm into fashion consumer lives lake,
it's a fashion,

787
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:48,404
he swims around in the mall and he meets
this peak and the peak does this speech 

788
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:53,174
about power and it goes like a love is 
just an evolutionary track and their 

789
00:36:57,771 --> 00:36:59,860
pleasures the same.
All the rides,

790
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,150
his power and he does this free speech.
Right.

791
00:37:02,151 --> 00:37:04,070
And as I can remember reading that like 
12 or something.

792
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,113
But it's just that,
I mean that's the assessment that's 

793
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:12,710
going on and people that want power of 
wellness is all their ads control.

794
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,750
Do you believe that?
Still the,

795
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,630
that pike saying that there's only one 
emotion and love.

796
00:37:19,631 --> 00:37:23,140
I don't believe it.
I reject it completely.

797
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:24,750
You believe in love?
Yeah.

798
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:25,883
Yeah,
totally.

799
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,680
Yeah,
me and not believe in love.

800
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:29,790
Right.
I remember

801
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,170
planes,
my son one day and he was,

802
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,790
he was pissed off a bone and he was 
like,

803
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,481
Oh,
you know,

804
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:38,190
you don't even like me do you?
Or something like that.

805
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:39,024
It's,
we're going to bed.

806
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,043
And I was like,
he to step in front of the bill it for 

807
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:42,840
you.
And he was like,

808
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,943
why?

809
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,410
He was just like this what it is very 
little cat.

810
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:47,244
He's maybe three or four at the time.
And you try and explain that or impact 

811
00:37:49,961 --> 00:37:51,130
that.
Tim is very difficult.

812
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,460
We're really didn't have an intuitive 
understanding of that.

813
00:37:54,461 --> 00:37:57,280
You think of overwhelming love?
I don't think they do.

814
00:37:57,281 --> 00:37:59,750
I mean I think Ted's are quite,
um,

815
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,530
it depends on your bra I suppose.
But selfish little bastards didn't know.

816
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,500
Like this one I've got,
it's only seven months old.

817
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:08,260
At least just I,
I'm diluting it will.

818
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,081
Yeah.
Yeah.

819
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:10,590
No,
I mean,

820
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,530
I mean,
and they have that.

821
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,030
They're really centered on themselves 
for the first few years aren't there and

822
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:18,370
then that's like that.
I think it would kill me for amusement.

823
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,373
I don't think there's,
I mean she's glorious and so beautiful 

824
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:31,471
and it's caused me to plumb new fathoms 
of love within myself.

825
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:36,180
But in return I have received little 
butt grabbed chest hair and

826
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:36,460
hair,

827
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,580
but I think the best thing in my life is
that important.

828
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:40,414
I'm uses my son the most,
is some misfortune be falling me in 

829
00:38:44,181 --> 00:38:46,170
margin in me,
frustrated.

830
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,120
Then I'm stuck in some place.
It's like,

831
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:50,530
what?
What he finds funniest too.

832
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:52,880
Anytime anything bad happens I think 
with,

833
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,180
I tell him this,
I mean he's going to kill himself.

834
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,110
Oh,
he loves it.

835
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,943
Yeah.

836
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,680
He loves nothing more than to hear you 
being trounced.

837
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,100
One of them things that you hadn't 
started.

838
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:03,830
Fuck.
He said when he come in here that bloody

839
00:39:03,831 --> 00:39:04,664
Yanis Varoufakis he came in here.
Tell us about the dynamics of path and 

840
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,620
you're,
hey guys,

841
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:09,381
I'm like,
those people,

842
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:10,610
they've got no power.
There were there,

843
00:39:10,611 --> 00:39:12,620
I've only got power within their 
systemic role.

844
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,100
Like even somebody said like wolf gang 
shall by the German chancellor.

845
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,000
He said out loud to that Yanis 
Varoufakis democracies.

846
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,360
Right.
As long as you don't change anything.

847
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,210
And he was not ever being ironic nor 
dismissive or anything.

848
00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:26,380
He just was state in some data,
democracies are right.

849
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,930
As long as it doesn't change anything 
and that,

850
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,400
that he within like the,
the,

851
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,880
it was sort of like you answer a fuck,
he said from his flirtation,

852
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:33,740
we've actual power structures that 
people were in,

853
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:35,990
it would just inhabit in particular 
roles.

854
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,360
And these were these,
they knew that.

855
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:38,540
Okay.

856
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,430
Yeah.
I think we make the mistake sometimes of

857
00:39:40,431 --> 00:39:42,560
going on from that obviously knows a lot
more than me,

858
00:39:42,561 --> 00:39:46,190
but I think I sometimes think we made 
the mistake of going on.

859
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,810
So the real power,
it's somewhere else.

860
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:49,420
The real powers that Ross child's or 
wherever,

861
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,530
and the real power is the system,
you know,

862
00:39:51,531 --> 00:39:54,580
the real parents systemic is within the 
institutions,

863
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,760
you know?

864
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,370
Yeah.
Well,

865
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,440
so you mean it is not a human power,
it's sort of superhuman or on the human?

866
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:00,730
Yeah.

867
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,640
Yeah.
It's like corporations,

868
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:03,540
you know,
that idea of,

869
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:04,374
oh,
we're going to make corporations liable 

870
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:08,160
for things you can,
there's a blueprints for making money.

871
00:40:08,161 --> 00:40:10,350
You need to look at ways of reducing 
their power,

872
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,670
you know?

873
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,503
Yeah.
That is actually one of the things that 

874
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:16,020
has come up from talking to people.
Let you know these,

875
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,093
you know,
the s and the Yanis Varoufakis and name 

876
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,870
and now yourself is that as long as they
are there,

877
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,560
as long as they are our hubs of power,
centralized power,

878
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:29,410
it's always going to behave according to
the motif of that pipe.

879
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,040
It's always going to perpetuate and 
sustain itself.

880
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:37,100
So the only way of changing it is to 
dismantle it even like it.

881
00:40:37,861 --> 00:40:40,860
So I do think that in like on a personal
level,

882
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,343
are you willing to make big sacrifice?
Do you think the Andy and do you think 

883
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:46,380
that people genuinely generally are?

884
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,500
I mean,
I don't think I need to.

885
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,670
I think it's like there's this,
there's,

886
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,900
there's a kind of equal to that.
You know,

887
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,743
I like that whole thing of lake.
I saw a documentary once to build that 

888
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,090
habit,
edge general,

889
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:02,910
all gays who pin on rocks and they see 
something that's really all,

890
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:04,190
it might be a thousand years old.
And I go,

891
00:41:04,191 --> 00:41:05,480
oh,
I'll just redo the eye,

892
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,580
you know?
And this researcher was seen it,

893
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:09,170
one of them I want you to not for,
you know,

894
00:41:09,171 --> 00:41:11,480
let's say and I'm antique essentially.
And the guy's like,

895
00:41:11,481 --> 00:41:14,690
no we don't just part of the same gate 
in hand that does this.

896
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,810
And I think if you think of yourself as 
oh I'm doing the eye,

897
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:18,943
it's much healthier for you than going,
I'm going to create this thing that 

898
00:41:21,321 --> 00:41:23,450
lasts for 2000 years.
Do you know what I mean?

899
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,620
Well it's a very wise,
very wise soul there sat there.

900
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:29,540
Frankie,
what was that thing I was thinking about

901
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:33,630
everyday you might like here it is.
What's thinking about them Amanda?

902
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,920
Laws like in other people take ages and 
ages to manufacturer them,

903
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,491
right?
Like,

904
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:38,324
you know,
sort of sit there ages than they are 

905
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:41,930
with the sand and it's bull lake takes a
week and then they just sweep it up.

906
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:45,140
And like obviously like me as a person 
that's likes permanence,

907
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,410
like oh no,
no,

908
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,300
don't,
that was brilliant.

909
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:48,134
Fuck.
But of course the pop point of it is 

910
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:51,830
Dean Jews.
That feeling cause you can lose your own

911
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:53,690
body yourself.
Everything's gonna fall apart.

912
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,370
[inaudible] kind old coat that poem you 
again.

913
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,450
But that even a thing like 
Michelangelo's David,

914
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:02,080
it's just a temporary thing.
The moment we'll come with,

915
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:02,923
you know,
so whatever death cult looms up out of 

916
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:05,930
Christianity,
if,

917
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:06,441
uh,
if the,

918
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,720
if the right demographic becomes poor 
enough,

919
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:09,763
if they rise up against idolatry,
chisel in hand to decide to smash away 

920
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:16,880
the renaissance in the Isis inspired 
frenzy.

921
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,893
Like you know,
that the Michelangelo's David is on its 

922
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:20,204
way to destruction and deterioration as 
all of our individual bodies are on 

923
00:42:22,911 --> 00:42:23,744
their way to destruction and 
deterioration and this sort of sense of 

924
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:29,300
oneness.
This idea that this aboriginal aborigine

925
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,520
exhibit eight in our bad just duty,
I,

926
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:33,000
that's a no,
no revere.

927
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:33,843
The deer on the rock.
That's that that is a better type of 

928
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:36,770
connection.
But that,

929
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,173
but that idea of a sort of an an it did 
indigenous connection beyond our 

930
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:44,360
individual understanding of time and 
space.

931
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,100
It's bloody hard to get that out.
There isn't,

932
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:46,731
it may,
I mean,

933
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:49,000
but that's not how people are really 
looking at the world.

934
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,020
Yeah.
I mean it is incredibly hard.

935
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:54,500
I think there's always that thing where 
like I was quite interested in this idea

936
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:55,334
for awhile.
Culture is like every resistance to 

937
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:00,800
civilization.
Do you ever had that?

938
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,800
Yeah.
So it's like this isn't my idea,

939
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:04,634
but it's like the idea is that what we 
call coach for now is kind of comes up 

940
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:12,720
in the time of like Fredric [inaudible] 
in Germany and it's sort of for,

941
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,573
for what became Germany and it's kind of
to resist the French idea of several 

942
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:19,100
eyes and through institutions.
So you know,

943
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:22,250
France has all these different academies
of the arts and so on.

944
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:23,084
And that partly that was a kind of soft 
power way of making everything very 

945
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:26,954
French,
you know,

946
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,920
and culture can arise is up to 
[inaudible] and I kind of think we're in

947
00:43:30,921 --> 00:43:31,754
a kind of late stage in that know where 
part of our problem is we work within 

948
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,480
institutions,
try and produce culture.

949
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,430
So the reason it's difficult to do a 
stand show on the BBC is that the comedy

950
00:43:43,431 --> 00:43:46,100
clubs,
part of the reason comedy clubs exist is

951
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:48,010
to resist things like the BBC.
Mr,

952
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,681
go on.
Have you seen that?

953
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:53,390
Fucking sure you know that part of the,
that's part of the reason for them,

954
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,510
you know?
So,

955
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,330
so where do you go from there?
I mean,

956
00:43:56,331 --> 00:44:00,800
do you democratize institutions or do 
you try and dry the clothes institutions

957
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:04,100
in some way or make them more 
representative or something?

958
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,170
But it seems like,
you know,

959
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:11,200
we'd all stuck in some sense within 
institutions that are kind of Pristina's

960
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,160
yes.
As oppose.

961
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:18,180
So a ref to refer back to that idea that
this,

962
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:21,750
we have ourselves become 
institutionalized.

963
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,250
Who is thinking our thought?
Who is prescribing the stories?

964
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,120
What is it that I'm thinking of when I'm
thinking of myself?

965
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,830
One of the things in our email 
correspondence you talked about was,

966
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:35,683
I can't remember the correct words,
but you talked about the idea of 

967
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:41,640
language being a sort of an effective 
agent of virus in the mind.

968
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,020
Talk me through that again.
I like that.

969
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,140
That's nice.
Here's my idea.

970
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,480
So the idea is like Kim,
Eh,

971
00:44:46,481 --> 00:44:47,314
you know what kit toxoplasmosis is a 
disease that cats or catch it gives to 

972
00:44:52,151 --> 00:44:56,290
mace and it clears tiny little scars in 
and may spins,

973
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,690
Eh,
that never heal the,

974
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,330
makes them nice,
behave in an uninhibited way.

975
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:04,080
So Eh,
when they're on inhabited,

976
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,980
they're more likely to be caught by the 
car.

977
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,040
Sort of like toxoplasmosis has a 
podocyte seat.

978
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,440
Brainpower piracy performs a function of
changing behavior to mace.

979
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:18,490
What if language is that for humanity?
So what if language has been seated here

980
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:19,743
to make us behave,
maybe just behave loader so that we can 

981
00:45:23,651 --> 00:45:24,484
be phoned and consumed by some cosmic 
entity or maybe it's simply something 

982
00:45:29,261 --> 00:45:31,420
that's watch and it makes us more 
amusing.

983
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,490
The fact that we're able to relate 
through language.

984
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:34,970
Is it really

985
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:35,803
beautiful and extraordinary idea?
I like the point of origin that cat 

986
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,190
shit,
cavalier mice,

987
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,630
but they go fucking the shit that makes 
my submit.

988
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,720
Cocksure buccaneer yeah,
the live fast die young mice population.

989
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,470
And you think that language could is 
this is really sort of a quiet,

990
00:45:53,471 --> 00:45:54,710
beautiful,
beautifully complex idea.

991
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,390
This isn't an occupying force because 
what is it manifesting all his metaphor,

992
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,300
all this symbol,
what is being expressed?

993
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,520
I mean,
I suppose it,

994
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,423
it denies the supposition that language 
is a reference to some deeper essential 

995
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:09,920
self.
It's,

996
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:10,783
it's,
it's,

997
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,300
it is.
It's own vessel made a minute done.

998
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:16,140
If we get into trouble with trump's skin
linguistics anywhere along the way.

999
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:16,370
Yeah.

1000
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:19,860
I think Chomsky be on our side on that 
thing turns Mckenna and bill for it.

1001
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,700
Terence Mckenna and nice,
great pioneers of DMT and Iowaska.

1002
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:26,840
That'd be well up for it.
But chompsky I mean he's a,

1003
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,773
he,
he seems quite dour at the best of the 

1004
00:46:29,341 --> 00:46:30,480
Times.
[inaudible] I like,

1005
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:31,314
uh,
yeah.

1006
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,510
Well Russell,
Frankie,

1007
00:46:33,511 --> 00:46:35,730
I don't think that that's of plausible 
at all.

1008
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,670
Like,
if the ice suck,

1009
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,500
you suck my life out at deal.
Oh No.

1010
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,320
Oh No.
What was my other thing there?

1011
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:44,880
Okay.
This is interesting.

1012
00:46:44,881 --> 00:46:47,640
I think he might bring me to the 
precipice of my awareness.

1013
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:48,474
So think like,
cause I never lose the tendrils and 

1014
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,260
threads that are required.
Oh yeah.

1015
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:57,410
Iowaska and DMT Doni above you as a 
person in sobriety and recovery,

1016
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:58,763
whoever is you determine your abstinent 
lifestyle edge that you can't take our 

1017
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:06,210
WESCO cause like you referenced Terence 
Mckenna there that grow cosmonaut of the

1018
00:47:06,211 --> 00:47:08,700
brain.
Like I listened to those.

1019
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,563
I watch youtube seems to borderline 
fetishistic Stickley of people talking 

1020
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:13,884
about,
you know like the describing their 

1021
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:18,540
journeys on dmt and DMT even more than 
Ios guy because you smoke in,

1022
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:21,930
it's such an obvious black crack as a 
hallucinogen,

1023
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,070
but I think,
Oh God,

1024
00:47:23,071 --> 00:47:25,410
I can't get away with that.
I can't sell my cell phone.

1025
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,333
No,
I'm only doing this for spiritual 

1026
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:27,804
reasons of research.
If I find myself with a pipe in my hand 

1027
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,540
fast,
no good look.

1028
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:35,170
Yeah.
So like are you not fascinated by having

1029
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:36,840
the,
some of these metaphors made literal?

1030
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,250
I'm fascinated if you've ever read the 
breaking open the head Daniel Pinchbeck.

1031
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,750
Yeah,
I liked Daniel Pinchbeck.

1032
00:47:42,751 --> 00:47:43,960
I know him.
Do you know what is,

1033
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,660
I'm second bit was called go on.
I am quit so quarter.

1034
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,910
So he did all this for me that don't 
know.

1035
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,180
He did other stuff.
Like we experimented with drugs and he's

1036
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,470
a really good book.
He talks about,

1037
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,010
you know what it's like to take hold of 
various,

1038
00:47:56,011 --> 00:47:58,510
can I listen to tunes?
But like by the second one he saw,

1039
00:47:58,511 --> 00:48:00,350
he was in Mexican guides quiz who 
quartile

1040
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,313
he crazy cold,
some feathered serpent and some inter 

1041
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:06,720
dimensional traveler scarf.
Good job.

1042
00:48:06,721 --> 00:48:08,940
I took all these drugs actually cause 
I've discovered up quick.

1043
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,650
It's a cot.
Oldest a separate thing.

1044
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,520
You don't think that was the drugs?
It wasn't quite the court took the drugs

1045
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:15,360
I'm good at.
Yeah.

1046
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,300
There's the drive sometime self in the 
critical using drugs.

1047
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,333
Um,
but like this for me there's something 

1048
00:48:21,451 --> 00:48:25,260
beautiful about this mystery in the it 
people have archetypal experiences.

1049
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,660
Well I find that exciting when it works.
That terence Mckenna stuff,

1050
00:48:27,661 --> 00:48:28,494
he's holding a minute people to drop in 
its acid and their flood plot of 

1051
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:31,063
plunging inward into inner myths and the
truths and this syntheses is that the 

1052
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:36,474
word we'd like different sense.
He's representing themselves in sort of 

1053
00:48:38,431 --> 00:48:42,480
different media like you're able to see 
visually the zeitgeists trends.

1054
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:43,523
For me that's a sort of a,
that image matrix suggest to me that my 

1055
00:48:47,851 --> 00:48:52,500
own consciousness is such a tiny 
aperture of a total consciousness.

1056
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,190
It makes me start remembering my own 
experiences and I said,

1057
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,280
and it makes you want to do it more.

1058
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:59,623
Yeah.
There's something to be said for that 

1059
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,310
wipeys.
We get older,

1060
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:02,540
we won't care.
Yeah,

1061
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:06,320
because we like as the material form 
disintegrate,

1062
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,920
you'll stuffing out of might as well 
just like dive within,

1063
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:11,750
let it fall apart.
I knew this girl,

1064
00:49:11,751 --> 00:49:12,584
he was on acid every day for a year as a
waitress and she was obviously having a 

1065
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:20,690
bad time and eventually she said to the 
people running the restaurant,

1066
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,913
look,
I've been on like a heavy dose of acid 

1067
00:49:23,121 --> 00:49:23,954
every day,
and they were like,

1068
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:24,891
you know,
I'm going to leave.

1069
00:49:24,891 --> 00:49:25,930
I'm going to go get therapy,
whatever.

1070
00:49:25,931 --> 00:49:27,020
And they're like,
don't leave.

1071
00:49:27,021 --> 00:49:27,854
You're like the best.

1072
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:30,623
Come on just for your brilliant.
Tell us more about that winged serpent 

1073
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:35,170
thing that you are.
Yeah,

1074
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,080
lots of it didn't affect her job as well
because like acid,

1075
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:38,914
like the first time I sort of heard of 
it was like people at school with them 

1076
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:44,170
in it and how can you do score and it's 
like,

1077
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:45,270
cause I didn't take it to a couple of 
years.

1078
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,690
I was like 18 first time I took it and 
forgot you can't do this and school like

1079
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:50,543
oh but everything just completely shut 
down my whole reality shutdown of love 

1080
00:49:54,251 --> 00:49:55,084
because my sense of self,
I remember that like in my 18 year old 

1081
00:49:58,091 --> 00:50:01,930
understanding of what reality was 
realizing oh no,

1082
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,853
there is no such thing as self.
This is just a composite of biography 

1083
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:07,683
and biochemical data and it probably 
wouldn't have known where it's like 

1084
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:12,460
biochemical data.
But I remember feeling that.

1085
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,350
I remember looking at my own anatomy.
Allah,

1086
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,330
you and Hitler not done saying good.
The same thing like I,

1087
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,350
I'm thinking these hands,
what is this occupant force?

1088
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:22,930
What is this energy?
That's not my thinking but is,

1089
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:23,764
is,
is my consciousness and my anatomical 

1090
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:26,044
awareness.
But there seems me that there is some 

1091
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:31,050
truth in that.
Some truth in being able to uh,

1092
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:31,963
add,
transcend my conventional ideas of self 

1093
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,060
and like that sometimes a material life 
with its prescription.

1094
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,240
It's not that I don't feel wonderful.
Moms are transcendent love,

1095
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:43,670
such as with my little kid and even 
decide the l May,

1096
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:46,690
I just went on a bar,
drove that day for 24 hours and a fought

1097
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,900
God.
Life can be so different.

1098
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:49,400
I'm a man on a barge.
Obviously I can work.

1099
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:50,234
The bar's probably so I have to keep 
getting out and why he didn't through 

1100
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:52,450
shallow waters.

1101
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,283
You're not mean it though,
but it seemed like such a renunciation 

1102
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,403
of ordinariness for me to be this bloke 
on a boat with a family as much as it 

1103
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:01,304
was to be a dad in a loft,
putting the crib up there when a baby 

1104
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:04,100
got too big for it.
I'm at that dinner loft.

1105
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:05,720
I'm at that dinner loft.
I'm a man on the board.

1106
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,180
There was blood.
The Indian now go to normally around the

1107
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:09,014
corner.
I've called up and got Indian from the 

1108
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:10,620
place.
I always get it.

1109
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,200
Life hadn't changed that Marshall 
wouldn't,

1110
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:13,034
we weren't dances with bloody wolves,
but it just made me realize this life 

1111
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,050
I'm living,
this is not it.

1112
00:51:18,051 --> 00:51:20,330
This is a selection.
This is a confection.

1113
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:25,331
I'm the curator of this reality.
I'm not like a promethium and trapped in

1114
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:26,870
a sick.
He'll call moment.

1115
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:27,704
I kind of any moment abandoned all this.
I remember once you have a girlfriend 

1116
00:51:30,351 --> 00:51:31,041
going to like,
she goes,

1117
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:31,874
no,
y'all don't like the way you do that 

1118
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:32,901
because,
well listen,

1119
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:36,080
let me know because I can let go of any 
of this shit for you.

1120
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:36,914
None of this is real.
I was just flung this together on the 

1121
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:42,770
off to get myself out of where I was to 
where I wanted to go.

1122
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:45,590
Let me know what you don't like this 
gone.

1123
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:49,310
So I've been absolutely denounced the 
ECENTRA south.

1124
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,840
That's great man.
You're not bow hex thing about um,

1125
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:53,423
Eh,
we all one consciousness experience in 

1126
00:51:54,671 --> 00:51:55,504
itself subject.

1127
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,290
Well,
yeah,

1128
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,123
I keep wanting to say it and then by 
every time I go to say it on the stage 

1129
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,740
before big Cavaday,
I don't say that Russell,

1130
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:03,603
that's Bill Hicks.
I'm actually just say that now because 

1131
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,800
that is one of your favorite bill Hicks 
space.

1132
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,450
But he's like,
because it's so true.

1133
00:52:10,451 --> 00:52:13,180
I keep arriving at it while like while 
riffing,

1134
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,500
it hangs above my,
a toilet in my bedroom.

1135
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,550
Picture poet x.
But that cool.

1136
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,450
This is live at my publisher gave me is 
what he would do his point.

1137
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:26,500
He would have one too.
Have you ever told you that thing?

1138
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,343
A bit.
Gay told me I should go hex for these 

1139
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,780
invasive but comedy,
no,

1140
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:30,571
go on.
So it was like,

1141
00:52:30,571 --> 00:52:31,800
call me.
Do you know Tom Rhodes?

1142
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:32,993
No,
he's not an American guy who I met 

1143
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:38,550
bizarrely on nine 11 and our Gig got 
canceled or in Dublin,

1144
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,400
but eh,
Tom and wrong.

1145
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:44,420
I choose when he did it off.
Now I'm that,

1146
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,190
but we were there.
Um,

1147
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,700
eh.
He said,

1148
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,613
Eh,
he met biohacks when he was blake 

1149
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,493
plainly the texts they suck or whatever 
he was at the time when he was like a 

1150
00:52:52,891 --> 00:52:53,724
really young guy and he's,
he pastored bell hacks for his advice 

1151
00:52:56,761 --> 00:52:59,640
over a couple of nights and biohacks hex
eventually said,

1152
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,170
look,
if you want to notice decrees,

1153
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:02,880
always be nice to the new guy.

1154
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,450
And for a few years I thought,
oh,

1155
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,060
he's having a joke,
Tom,

1156
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:06,983
you know he's going to in the new guy,
pester me and I'm being nice by fobbing 

1157
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:10,563
you off with us.
But now I kinda think in this better 

1158
00:53:12,371 --> 00:53:15,140
have been now,
but engineer working on the eye that has

1159
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,390
kind of a bike that is realizing that 
you are not the be all and end all.

1160
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:19,443
There's the next generation along from 
that and the next generation along for 

1161
00:53:21,821 --> 00:53:22,710
my,
and you're just,

1162
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,530
you're just filling in a little,
you know,

1163
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,720
stuff on this stone.
Is it powerful?

1164
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:30,810
Is Transcendent id just so together the 
aboriginal,

1165
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:34,780
I have a beautiful Bill Hicks story and 
if punctured,

1166
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:36,660
just for a moment,
my narcissism,

1167
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:38,100
but hold on,
I'll get it back.

1168
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:40,620
Wait a minute and it must be some reason
why I'm important.

1169
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:43,470
The eyebrows,
MTV awards was married that time.

1170
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:45,120
Come on,
you can do it,

1171
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:46,820
but have you ever lesson they join it.

1172
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,690
John Lennon talk about it.
No,

1173
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:49,923
Lennon tastes like thousands of trips 
and say he's like eventually Lizard 

1174
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:56,730
Cortana and talking about it.
He says like he eventually just realizes

1175
00:53:56,731 --> 00:53:57,564
he's dissolved his whole legal,
he doesn't experience life as a can a 

1176
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:04,200
narcissist anymore and he can't rate and
some friend comes to visit him.

1177
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:06,380
I guess someone from England and say 
it's Luke.

1178
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,540
Remember that time that you wrote that 
song?

1179
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:11,950
You mean take then that was in like all 
the,

1180
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:12,893
all the different staff that is ego has 
helped him to do and Lennon of 

1181
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:16,864
eventually arrives at the point before 
he has just come back of going do need 

1182
00:54:20,551 --> 00:54:23,220
some ego to get stuff done.
You can just

1183
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:24,603
well in Nail Bhagavad Gita,
they're pretty clear about this is you 

1184
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:30,110
are here,
you are in the material world,

1185
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:34,030
but God's got nothing against material 
we did not denounce material with.

1186
00:54:34,031 --> 00:54:34,864
They're not favor,
absolute asceticism and totaled 

1187
00:54:36,581 --> 00:54:38,710
announcement of this accenture,
you will experience it.

1188
00:54:38,711 --> 00:54:41,880
I mean there's a for luck joyousness in 
Hinduism that I robbery enjoy.

1189
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:42,783
Yeah.
Above the austerity or for some other 

1190
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:47,950
faiths that I know equally lethal about 
and like sort of,

1191
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,610
um,
what I like about that is the,

1192
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,421
the,
the,

1193
00:54:50,421 --> 00:54:51,254
the,
the ego is an artifact that is not just 

1194
00:54:53,651 --> 00:54:58,651
this sort of product of commodification,
commodification and capitalism by its,

1195
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:00,124
it can be this glorious expression in 
that Bill Hicks way of their 

1196
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:04,750
consciousness experience,
limitless consciousness.

1197
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,030
The experience in itself,
excuse me,

1198
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,470
subjectively that it in a kind of like 
an an aesthetic idea,

1199
00:55:11,471 --> 00:55:13,120
like a while to like,
you know,

1200
00:55:13,121 --> 00:55:15,790
owner,
wearable work of art or be a work of art

1201
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,890
that we can become like,
you know,

1202
00:55:17,891 --> 00:55:19,090
the,
it needn't be,

1203
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,160
excuse me,
fuck it.

1204
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:24,140
Now I think I'm going to actually vomit.
It's like I'm drunk high west Scott.

1205
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,250
Cause somehow just by virtue of talking 
about it,

1206
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,490
but that we can become the realization 
of this beauty,

1207
00:55:30,491 --> 00:55:31,324
this facet of the limitless that the 
whole can be experienced in the 

1208
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:36,010
individual.
That's the problem.

1209
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:36,963
I'm curious at this thing goes,
the genie's out of the bottle on 

1210
00:55:38,681 --> 00:55:39,514
individual ism.
You're not going to tell people you're 

1211
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:41,680
part of the parish.
Come on this,

1212
00:55:41,681 --> 00:55:44,050
get together and be a collective.
There's pot on a boiler suit.

1213
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:45,460
I said,
that Shit's over.

1214
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,530
You know,
people are gonna want to be individuals,

1215
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:48,483
but that's why I'm,
I forever find myself banging on about 

1216
00:55:50,441 --> 00:55:53,920
the importance of religion because I 
think it's the only way to transcend the

1217
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:54,754
prohibitions and limitations of 
materialism that you've got to somehow 

1218
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:58,683
engage the mythic imagination of people.
But you're right that it is a sort of a 

1219
00:56:02,441 --> 00:56:03,274
form of propagandizing people and it 
does require that you yourself believe 

1220
00:56:07,181 --> 00:56:07,870
in the metaphor.

1221
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:08,703
And that's,
I guess why I'm interested in 

1222
00:56:10,031 --> 00:56:13,660
hallucinogens and psychedelics because 
it's a way of make the dream real.

1223
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:16,150
I heard this thing frankie about like,
um,

1224
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:17,223
like I think it's apocryphal,
but it's a nice little thing like I was 

1225
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,690
that when the settlers came,
the settlers,

1226
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,980
they shamed the hunter gatherer 
societies and most notably the Shaman,

1227
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,023
the shaman,
they said your rituals are bullshit and 

1228
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:30,970
meaningless.
Your dances,

1229
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,930
your spells and your silliness,
Eh,

1230
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,640
out on the edge of the village and the 
Shaman became clown,

1231
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,790
lost the visa ability to be mythic and 
potent.

1232
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:40,743
The Shaman becomes the clown earth and 
profane nothing but each jokes to guard 

1233
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:49,780
him against these new d as the settlers 
drag him down.

1234
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,913
You know,
and this is what we've become now the 

1235
00:56:52,071 --> 00:56:52,760
shaman.
Okay.

1236
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,370
I've often thought at the center of 
every joke scandal,

1237
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:58,290
you can see why shamans left on the edge
of tone.

1238
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,513
You know,
you've got to make a quick getaway 

1239
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:01,703
sometimes

1240
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:07,070
didn't like that one stick.
Nailed mosques on that same thing.

1241
00:57:08,251 --> 00:57:13,251
My backpack and off I go,
Hello Wickham people,

1242
00:57:14,641 --> 00:57:16,870
you know that got feelings.
Yeah.

1243
00:57:16,871 --> 00:57:19,720
So like what do you feel when you're in 
the midst of some Brouhaha?

1244
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,120
I wonder if the things I most enjoyed 
about you is watching on line,

1245
00:57:22,121 --> 00:57:22,954
how you beautifully articulate it.
The scandal around where the joke you 

1246
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:33,730
made around about Harvey and Katie 
Price.

1247
00:57:33,731 --> 00:57:34,564
I thought it was such a beautiful 
rendering cause I would obviously from 

1248
00:57:36,671 --> 00:57:38,500
a,
a sort of a like a humanist,

1249
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:39,334
I suppose if you want to word 
perspective God k prize wouldn't class 

1250
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:44,740
woman Harvey Meant Leo.
But like,

1251
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:45,370
you know,
like,

1252
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:48,100
but I obviously first and foremost it 
enjoy it,

1253
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,150
the joke,
uh,

1254
00:57:49,151 --> 00:57:50,690
and secondly,
uh,

1255
00:57:50,691 --> 00:57:51,524
your analysis of it,
it was quite beautiful whenever I've 

1256
00:57:52,841 --> 00:57:56,550
been called upon to justify the,
and my Andrew Sachs saying,

1257
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:59,080
ah,
I've always got angry again.

1258
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,720
I've always got angry because I'm like,
it's not even real.

1259
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:03,580
It's not even fucking real.
They weren't even offended.

1260
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,220
It's not this just because of the 
collision of the BBC,

1261
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:08,170
this mainstream media because they saw,
you know,

1262
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:11,440
like I've got an re engaged reenergized 
by it.

1263
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:14,670
How do you feel about sort of like 
justifying your own jokes,

1264
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:15,504
scandal stuff?

1265
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:16,873
I don't believe it.
I've never tried to really justify 

1266
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,470
anything.
Um,

1267
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:22,040
I think sometimes like that thing you're
describing there,

1268
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:22,874
it's just that fact that you understand 
at the center of something that is much 

1269
00:58:25,611 --> 00:58:29,810
more complex than what has been boiled 
down to in a tabloid.

1270
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,411
You know,
and you're like,

1271
00:58:30,411 --> 00:58:31,244
well that routine starts a certain way 
and it goes a different place and when 

1272
00:58:34,491 --> 00:58:36,290
the night is different every night and 
blah,

1273
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:36,711
blah,
blah.

1274
00:58:36,711 --> 00:58:39,750
And why am I getting hoisted for this?
So does that say to,

1275
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:40,993
but there's also the same,
but it's like how many people have 

1276
00:58:44,841 --> 00:58:47,870
really got a sense of humor for this 
kind of thing.

1277
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:51,470
So like if you look at like what we 
would call a of comedy,

1278
00:58:51,471 --> 00:58:53,180
we'd guess we'd see ourselves in that 
tradition,

1279
00:58:53,181 --> 00:58:56,270
wouldn't we've,
we watched probably all the same comics,

1280
00:58:56,271 --> 00:58:58,270
like when we were kids.
Um,

1281
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,310
the back was the biggest alternative 
comedy.

1282
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:02,293
Sure.
Like an hour over the period of our 

1283
00:59:04,551 --> 00:59:06,260
careers,
maybe the office or something.

1284
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,390
So the office maybe got two and a half 
million or something.

1285
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:13,010
3 million people and says maybe 60 
million viewers in Britain.

1286
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:13,973
She charitably you're thinking like the 
biggest desk can go is about 5% of the 

1287
00:59:17,871 --> 00:59:20,870
population is going to be untethered to 
get more than that.

1288
00:59:20,871 --> 00:59:23,100
You've much caught to be like,
come on and a dress.

1289
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,930
I'll do it.
So most people aren't into this.

1290
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:32,000
I know a lot of the problem is like 
you've been asked to justify jokes,

1291
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,020
which is okay,
but not to people who don't particularly

1292
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:39,470
like or even understand like what you're
doing.

1293
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,150
You know?
So that's a huge part of it.

1294
00:59:41,151 --> 00:59:45,170
Is there the papers in particular author
by relocation,

1295
00:59:45,171 --> 00:59:49,820
they're taking something that you said 
to one audience so that you said at nine

1296
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:50,654
o'clock on a Friday night in Newcastle 
and showing it to people over their 

1297
00:59:52,911 --> 00:59:55,140
breakfast and their home,
county and Gomez,

1298
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:57,080
that's acceptable for them.

1299
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,640
Yes.
CSS.

1300
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:01,483
Yeah,
that re contextualization is such a 

1301
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:04,304
vital and neglected component and what 
I've always found it also annoying is 

1302
01:00:08,241 --> 01:00:13,241
the disingenuity of the papers when they
do the repositioning of like that.

1303
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,370
I don't think that they are ever,
he said what?

1304
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,890
Oh Man.
Oh No.

1305
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:20,640
Come on.
We can to have to

1306
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,620
journalist of all people.
Someone who let,

1307
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:25,900
Shirley goes through other people's 
fucking Ben.

1308
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,333
They sitting there like horrified that 
someone's dressed up as the twin towers 

1309
01:00:30,131 --> 01:00:31,360
at Halloween or something,
you know?

1310
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:36,370
Oh my God,
us to people who feel any shock.

1311
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,460
I had one that was like I did a joint is
years ago.

1312
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,353
The guy who did the speaking clock died 
and I did something to call them or 

1313
01:00:43,571 --> 01:00:45,000
something that said hopefully died 
after,

1314
01:00:45,001 --> 01:00:45,834
sees a small strokes and I got an email 
from the journalists or the Daily 

1315
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:51,573
Telegraph who said,
well actually miss through whatever his 

1316
01:00:53,051 --> 01:00:53,884
name is,
dead die from a series of small strokes 

1317
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:56,703
and I'm a bit to foreign his family.
Oh if you can make him ask him if he'd 

1318
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:02,820
find your joy commuters and is there 
anything you'd like times can just don't

1319
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:05,230
the money fucking joke.
Then it's you joke,

1320
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:08,560
you telling them that joke they'd never 
have hair day.

1321
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:09,933
If someone projects upon movie on the 
side of a primary school that police 

1322
01:01:12,161 --> 01:01:13,680
don't erase Ron Jeremy for

1323
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:18,740
the old throne children over there.
Oh No,

1324
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:19,660
I'll get off on it.
Yeah,

1325
01:01:19,661 --> 01:01:20,680
you're quite right.
Yes.

1326
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:24,430
You'll see that it's brilliant the way 
that they've extricated themselves,

1327
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:28,720
that people's sort of shock impulse is 
so readily available.

1328
01:01:28,721 --> 01:01:30,780
The bypasses their bill,
they go,

1329
01:01:30,781 --> 01:01:33,550
oh hang on a minute,
why am I being even told this now?

1330
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,910
It's like cause all of us on a personal 
level,

1331
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,450
no,
that there's things that we would say to

1332
01:01:37,451 --> 01:01:39,970
one another that now if I'm with my 
girlfriend's parents,

1333
01:01:39,971 --> 01:01:41,800
I'm not going to go.
I'll just reframe you boil.

1334
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,673
We had a real laugh about the med Taleah
I recognize it and also doesn't it like 

1335
01:01:47,561 --> 01:01:48,394
it's a language that has a sort of a 
like exact got codes in it that I know 

1336
01:01:51,341 --> 01:01:54,370
that mine are,
my actual attitude is to mental illness.

1337
01:01:54,371 --> 01:01:57,940
I know my actual attitude is to death 
and sadness and grief.

1338
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:02,470
Didn't we not permit ourselves a bit of 
fucking latitude and a bit of relief?

1339
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,180
Well,
there's comedic license.

1340
01:02:04,181 --> 01:02:05,014
I guess this is what we're seeing.
Ultimately there's a comedic license in 

1341
01:02:07,151 --> 01:02:10,090
the same way that there's artistic 
license or poetic license.

1342
01:02:10,091 --> 01:02:10,924
No,
it's just a poet with the fucking sun 

1343
01:02:12,341 --> 01:02:14,020
coming up in the morning.
Isn't it like a lion?

1344
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,530
We cannot put the fuck you talking 
about.

1345
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:16,100
Yeah.

1346
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,320
Clinics lives.
Waking Up Sifford I happen to just say,

1347
01:02:18,321 --> 01:02:19,360
okay,
could happen any time.

1348
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:20,730
It don't make a good point.
The screwed up.

1349
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:22,090
It's rubbish.
But you know we can,

1350
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,970
why don't we get this in license because
I suppose it's,

1351
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,140
well let me look out like,
cause I've often thought of that,

1352
01:02:28,141 --> 01:02:32,370
that that that profanity being a sort of
better nation of territory.

1353
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:33,204
Like I enjoy doing comedy that is like 
disgusting and rude and raw and raw 

1354
01:02:36,221 --> 01:02:38,640
curse I suppose get off in it and some 
very in various ways.

1355
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:39,474
But I think what it also does is it can 
sort of act as a kind of explosion that 

1356
01:02:41,881 --> 01:02:43,920
gives you access to different 
territories that people are a little bit

1357
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:47,880
shaken and then you can sort of say 
something beautiful or whatever.

1358
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,390
But I think that that people would like 
to keep the consciousness,

1359
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:54,570
the common consciousness,
the public consciousness in existence on

1360
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:55,404
certain neurological pathways that exist
on an individual level and on a 

1361
01:02:57,421 --> 01:02:58,254
collective and dialectic level also.
And that if you can untrammeled those 

1362
01:03:01,771 --> 01:03:02,604
circuits,
those grids with explosive behaviors 

1363
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:05,670
that that's dangerous.

1364
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:06,683
Sure.
I mean I think there's three things 

1365
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:09,450
going on.
One is you level late,

1366
01:03:09,451 --> 01:03:10,284
what comedy can do,
because if you're not allowed to shock 

1367
01:03:11,881 --> 01:03:13,920
and you're not allowed to do something 
at the start,

1368
01:03:13,921 --> 01:03:14,754
because often those jokes they get most 
offended about or things you do to open 

1369
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:17,910
up other subjects,
right?

1370
01:03:17,911 --> 01:03:19,860
Yes.
Then that levels out what you can do.

1371
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,780
The other thing is they want to print 
the jock.

1372
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:23,030
You know,
they want to put in the jaw,

1373
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:25,030
they're look of Victorian freak.
Sure.

1374
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:29,360
I look at the depravity but they want to
show it.

1375
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:32,420
But he does have perfectly formed to 
janitor tools from,

1376
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:37,550
I'll just give me a quick give a wag 
their cake and eat it.

1377
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:38,503
Yeah.
And I think the other thing is just a 

1378
01:03:41,811 --> 01:03:46,811
general thing they want to promote,
which is the idea of Eh,

1379
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:51,290
public opinion as synonymous with press 
opinion.

1380
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:53,710
You know,
so it ended up the public would rage but

1381
01:03:53,711 --> 01:03:54,544
us,
we looked on twitter and we find some 

1382
01:03:55,701 --> 01:03:56,534
people at Ridge,
you can literally find anything if you 

1383
01:03:58,221 --> 01:04:01,100
want to prevent the in from either side 
of an argument,

1384
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,140
just the tape and to twitter.
There's people who say,

1385
01:04:03,141 --> 01:04:05,200
I hate yellow,
yellow.

1386
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,083
Um,
so what they want to do is make their 

1387
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:15,270
opinions synonymous with public,
the public domain,

1388
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,340
which is,
you know,

1389
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:17,331
yes,
it's to,

1390
01:04:17,331 --> 01:04:20,730
to validate and mandate there.
I'm going to say it,

1391
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:21,653
Veltin showering I there,
there I've said to allison showing it's 

1392
01:04:23,431 --> 01:04:24,970
been said now,
hmm.

1393
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,010
Yeah,
that's interesting.

1394
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:28,250
So then you think,
ah,

1395
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,860
that bears sort of,
that when we're talking about change,

1396
01:04:31,861 --> 01:04:33,360
social change,
there's kind of an,

1397
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:34,223
uh,
an obligation to reimagine in ways that 

1398
01:04:36,961 --> 01:04:37,794
a role for bold and may initially seem 
sort of a bit mental in their boldness 

1399
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,880
to,
yeah.

1400
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,980
That's what I think as well.
I don't know quite how to do x.

1401
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,823
The problem is,
is because people have been so 

1402
01:04:47,641 --> 01:04:51,180
beautifully schooled in,
I thought that,

1403
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:52,014
you know,
it's in rejecting radicalism of 

1404
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:58,380
associating it with the other nurse is 
the exotic,

1405
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,710
the feminine,
the mysterious,

1406
01:05:01,711 --> 01:05:03,240
the sort of,
what do I want to say,

1407
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:04,230
the,
um,

1408
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,650
orient or to reject it,
to reject that.

1409
01:05:07,651 --> 01:05:08,760
Now,
whenever you say that,

1410
01:05:08,761 --> 01:05:11,970
why don't we just sort of break down all
superstructures and live in small,

1411
01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:14,870
manageable communities.
Like chimpanzees naturally works.

1412
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,713
We can't handle them on 75 relationships
and just municipal infrastructure where 

1413
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:19,744
required around transport and energy 
systems and not have power that exists 

1414
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:23,674
for profit at all.
And that we'll get our kicks and not 

1415
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:28,830
from consumerism,
but by interfacing with the limit.

1416
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:32,290
This beauty of the cosmos that we have 
access to for our consciousness.

1417
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:33,243
Vote for me.
I think you can like there's that thing 

1418
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:37,264
isn't there?
What your seven stages away from the 

1419
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:41,290
public there or would you imagine the 
general public car,

1420
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,570
but then you try and do that like when 
you're rating.

1421
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,433
So I was trying to read a thing this 
week with the British empire and the 

1422
01:05:46,281 --> 01:05:49,450
idea of some people see the British 
empires,

1423
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:50,710
you know,
it was okay.

1424
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,440
It was a mixed bag and it would just 
empirically untrue,

1425
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:54,120
you know,
and,

1426
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:54,953
and,
and for some reason it's not okay to be 

1427
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,150
creationist,
but it has all care to,

1428
01:05:58,210 --> 01:05:59,043
of maybe then poems.
It was massive excess deaths and it's 

1429
01:06:02,441 --> 01:06:04,270
all in paddock.
Provable.

1430
01:06:04,271 --> 01:06:06,790
And I brought some jargon with something
along the lines of,

1431
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,073
um,
there was a tray somewhere who said a 

1432
01:06:10,661 --> 01:06:11,494
stranger is a friend that you haven't 
met yet and I can't imagine who quite 

1433
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:18,490
clear they died out and you know,
so you,

1434
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,050
you sort of approach,
you learn that,

1435
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:20,903
how do I gradually,
it's through five stages may when I'm 

1436
01:06:23,351 --> 01:06:27,490
right and had a good actually bring 
people to the idea which is main,

1437
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:29,660
which is instinctively reject,
you know,

1438
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,713
ideas of empire.

1439
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,700
Yes,
that's right.

1440
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:33,534
Because it's difficult isn't it,
to ravel and discard centuries if 

1441
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:40,640
indoctrination like,
uh,

1442
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:44,460
I mean I myself when abroad will sort of
like,

1443
01:06:44,461 --> 01:06:47,610
I remember the royal wedding was on when
I was in la and I was like,

1444
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,780
oh,
it's good.

1445
01:06:48,781 --> 01:06:50,080
This,
I don't remember.

1446
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:50,923
So I like got swept up in it.
Know there were things where they sort 

1447
01:06:53,161 --> 01:06:55,150
of got it.
This is sort of a broad desire and,

1448
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,390
and sort of possibly the wrong place to 
explore it,

1449
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,433
but they showed how many,
like members of that congregation that 

1450
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:04,470
day were dressed in literal Disney 
costumes if you ever seen that.

1451
01:07:04,471 --> 01:07:05,550
But they kept going,
look,

1452
01:07:05,551 --> 01:07:07,450
here's this person that's a Disney 
costume.

1453
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:08,730
Like they found it,
but loads of,

1454
01:07:08,731 --> 01:07:11,220
I'm not that pepper middle turn.
She's dressed like someone at butte in a

1455
01:07:11,221 --> 01:07:12,150
piece.
There is that one.

1456
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,310
Hang on a minute.
This is bizarre.

1457
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:19,450
There's this sort of blending of the 
world of Disney and royal weddings,

1458
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:20,993
but regardless,
my point was that that a little bit of 

1459
01:07:22,261 --> 01:07:23,940
pageantry and I was war,
right,

1460
01:07:23,941 --> 01:07:26,100
whooped up and you know,
I love a World Cup.

1461
01:07:26,101 --> 01:07:27,810
I love a bit of tribalism.

1462
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:28,813
Well,
the electrically bro,

1463
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:31,730
all that end as if the lost power,
the royals,

1464
01:07:31,731 --> 01:07:33,950
so they didn't use to harm huge royal 
weddings.

1465
01:07:33,951 --> 01:07:34,784
It's a fairly modern trend,
but also they're going to need to like 

1466
01:07:38,571 --> 01:07:41,600
stopped shooting the cameras that can 
lead to stop turning the cameras,

1467
01:07:41,601 --> 01:07:42,434
render in their audience eventually.
So unrepresentative of brand and it's 

1468
01:07:44,721 --> 01:07:47,860
like [inaudible] Sanchez funeral.
You know,

1469
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:50,060
you're just like,
nobody needs to see those people.

1470
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,250
You're going to need to just focus on 
something else,

1471
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,520
right?
The revelation you can no longer,

1472
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:58,420
I suppose now with the ability to 
disseminate information is more and more

1473
01:07:58,421 --> 01:07:59,254
difficult to control the truth.
And while social media is still a 

1474
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:06,010
corporate spear and controlled by those 
kind of,

1475
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,540
you know,
interests,

1476
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:11,500
it's that just the information itself 
starts to have an impact.

1477
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,680
I said Ronins like I went two years ago,
did a pace,

1478
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:17,660
were interviewed Keith.
Richard took about 10 minutes.

1479
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:18,494
We've met to write 5,000
words like so for Rolling Stone Gig and 

1480
01:08:21,651 --> 01:08:22,484
like they,
the stones themselves carefully manage 

1481
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:26,533
the letting you see their audience 
because that's the elderly now altamont 

1482
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:33,830
no more.
And I suppose all empires,

1483
01:08:33,831 --> 01:08:34,664
myths,
emblems brands are held together by 

1484
01:08:36,771 --> 01:08:37,221
saying no,
no,

1485
01:08:37,221 --> 01:08:38,660
no,
we are the populace.

1486
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:39,613
We found one person on twitter who said 
that that just funeral was a lovely 

1487
01:08:42,711 --> 01:08:43,990
event.
Yeah.

1488
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,350
Laser flowers and consuming,
I need a week so badly now I can sort of

1489
01:08:48,351 --> 01:08:51,350
feel it sort of coming out amidst my 
organs.

1490
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:52,483
So,
so before I came reject more urine and 

1491
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:55,214
some people would say that's all of the 
broadcast has ever been a hemorrhaging 

1492
01:08:58,611 --> 01:09:02,420
of micturation by a man floundering,
looking for something to cling to.

1493
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:04,610
Thanks.
No thanks for having me,

1494
01:09:04,611 --> 01:09:05,900
man.
It's really brilliant to talk to you.

1495
01:09:05,901 --> 01:09:07,880
I really enjoyed it.
It was a bit where it got really,

1496
01:09:07,881 --> 01:09:08,714
really,
uh,

1497
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:11,450
I zoned out,
zoned out,

1498
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:12,343
glitched out.
Like where I feel the flexing of the 

1499
01:09:13,731 --> 01:09:15,170
glass,
of my understanding.

1500
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,850
I would quite like that.
Sure man.

1501
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,120
Enjoy that.
What would we do now?

1502
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:20,300
Well,
that's the end of it and we go back to a

1503
01:09:20,301 --> 01:09:21,640
normal life.
So classes it isn't,

1504
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:24,440
it just have to accept this was a little
paddock of time that existed.

1505
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,510
I can't live with you now.
Is it?

1506
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:27,261
Oh,
I've got children.

1507
01:09:27,261 --> 01:09:28,820
You've got children.
That's it.

1508
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:29,810
We just carry on with our lives.

1509
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:31,040
We're all going to go have some ice 
cream.

1510
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:32,930
It's going to be okay,
Frankie.

1511
01:09:32,931 --> 01:09:35,130
Thank you.
They go one shift.

1512
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,673
