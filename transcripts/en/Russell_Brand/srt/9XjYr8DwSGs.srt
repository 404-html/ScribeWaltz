Thank you very much for coming on under 

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,500
the skin.
Pleasure to be here.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,833
This is a big subject to discuss the 
relationship between the senses and 

13
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:50,100
consciousness.
The sense is,

14
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,970
I suppose it's these are the avenues to 
experience these represent who we are,

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,400
but it seems from even a cursory 
examination of your work,

16
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:09,810
there is much misunderstanding about the
framework of the centers.

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,260
Can you talk to us a little about that 
note?

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,720
I believe the I aristotle and idea that 
there are about five.

19
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,970
Yeah,
I mean I think you're right.

20
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:20,790
The sensors are our closest contact with
the world.

21
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,420
You know,
that's how we know where we are,

22
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,273
so we see things in front of us here,
things are in touch with people quite 

23
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:28,014
literally taste and smell,
and we've for a long time thought we 

24
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:34,230
just have five senses that whatever 
we're perceiving,

25
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,630
it's got to be either seeing or hearing,
smelling,

26
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:37,470
tasting,
touching,

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,150
and we get that from aristotle who told 
us we had these five senses.

28
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,290
And it's strange because if you talk to 
neuroscientists as I do know,

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,390
you ask him any senses of we got,
they say anywhere between 22 and 33,

30
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,220
you know,
many senses.

31
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,060
And it's kind of funny that we've given 
up aristotle's view.

32
00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:00,660
There were only five elements that made 
up the whole of the world.

33
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:01,591
Uh,
we,

34
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:03,840
we've rejected that physics has done 
away with it,

35
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:04,674
but,
but the idea that we have five senses 

36
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:06,954
has prevailed and that's what people 
think of when they think about 

37
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:12,000
themselves.
The thing I've just got five,

38
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,770
we go out now and we ask people in the 
street,

39
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:15,210
they'll say five sensors.
Sure.

40
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,630
Lack of a safari.
You sort of think elephants,

41
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,310
giraffes,
lions.

42
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,110
So sight,
smell,

43
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,280
taste,
hearing,

44
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:25,200
touch.
So like bit beyond that,

45
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:26,820
we say,
what is,

46
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:29,950
what is the panoply of sense neglected?
Well,

47
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,893
let's just,
just think of a few more sense of 

48
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:34,500
balance.
If that goes off,

49
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:37,020
you know all about it.
I mean the world starts spinning so it's

50
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:37,870
going to affect,
you know,

51
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,723
how your vision is behaving and your 
sense of balance is clearly important 

52
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,300
and on all the time if things are going 
well,

53
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,520
uh,
if people are home,

54
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:48,510
wants to do this,
you know,

55
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,720
try standing up and standing on one leg 
and they'll wobble at all there.

56
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,653
Okay?
Now try closing your eyes and standing 

57
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:00,280
on one leg and you'll find it's much 
harder.

58
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,473
I know.
You'll know that your sense of balance 

59
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:06,250
is actually made up of three sentences.
Sight,

60
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,653
proprioception,
which is their sense we have of our own 

61
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:13,690
body from the inside.
If you close your eyes,

62
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:14,524
now you know where your feet are on your
hands are without having to see them or 

63
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,610
touch them.
You just feel where they are,

64
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,540
but it's not by not by touch.
So that's your proprioception.

65
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,000
That's knowing where your body is in 
space,

66
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,330
so that sense plus site plus these 
beautiful little ear canals you have,

67
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:38,050
so you've got ear canals pointing up and
down,

68
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,003
backwards and forwards and side to side,
and that tells you whether in a left 

69
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:43,354
you're going up or whether you're 
rushing forward and that combines with 

70
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:51,250
site and with a sense of your body to 
give you your sense of balance.

71
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,293
Am I lying down to my standing upright?
My tipping over incredibly complex 

72
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,270
mechanisms which boundary our sense of 
self sensory deprivation.

73
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Then I suppose is an interesting area 
because it limits how we encode it.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,833
Limits experience and if the sensory 
deprivation tank or people that are 

75
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,110
blind from birth or don't have hearing 
that well,

76
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:25,360
that that makes a big,
big difference.

77
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:26,194
So,
so the funny thing about the senses is 

78
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,510
there a little bit narcissistic.
They tell you about the world,

79
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:35,650
but they also tell you about you.
So they're giving you a sense of how you

80
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:39,820
are and what's going on with you.
So even as we speak now,

81
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,120
we are making sounds that have a echo 
from the wall or from the table,

82
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,963
the floor,
and that's telling us kind of how much 

83
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:51,100
noise we're producing.
But if you've ever been,

84
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:52,840
as I'm sure you have as,
as a,

85
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,570
uh,
as an artist who works in sound,

86
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,853
if you've ever been in an anechoic 
chamber where there's absolutely no 

87
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,010
echo,
it's frightening.

88
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,230
You make assigned nothing comes back and
you actually feel you're almost dead.

89
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,210
There is a feeling that you've,
you've kind of landed in some weird,

90
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:14,044
strange world and the,
and the thing is that your brain is 

91
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:20,620
paying attention to the,
to the sounds you make in the world.

92
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,330
So as you walk along the pavement,
obviously your feet are making a noise,

93
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,330
but you don't realize because you're not
paying attention to it,

94
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,180
that the brain has recording that 
signed.

95
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,073
So colleagues of Mine and at Adora and 
affiliate Darwalla created these 

96
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:40,330
beautiful things.
Sonic shoes.

97
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,493
So you're wearing a,
you're wearing a kind of flip flop and 

98
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,060
their little sensors in it and it's 
sending information up to headphones.

99
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,373
And as you walk,
they can make your footsteps sound 

100
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,400
heavier,
louder,

101
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,563
or make them sound lighter.
And the interesting thing is that 

102
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,174
people's bodies behave completely 
differently when you make the sign from 

103
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,650
their own feet signed heavy,
they slouched the lean forward,

104
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,720
they look as though it's a real effort.

105
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,123
And when you turn the frequency up high,
so you just get this sort of light sign 

106
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:16,670
from the feet.
People start leaping,

107
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:17,504
they actually start moving more happily 
in space and you think that's 

108
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:21,704
incredible.
You didn't realize that your brain and 

109
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:26,720
your body are trying to make everything 
fit together.

110
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,720
You're getting signals from signed,
from touch,

111
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,340
from,
from smell,

112
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:32,174
from everything.
And the brain is trying to put all that 

113
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,550
information together and to see what's 
going on out there.

114
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,850
And how are things with me are 
experiencing realities,

115
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,060
obviously determined by the senses.
What are these studies,

116
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,560
uh,
that,

117
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,673
uh,
demonstrate that if you're asked to 

118
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,400
answer social political questions,
for example,

119
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:56,840
should there be more or less immigration
that your response may vary if there's a

120
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:59,120
presence of an unpleasant smell in the 
room?

121
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,550
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

122
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,473
Well,
that stuff's interesting because smell 

123
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:07,130
is the most neglected sense and if you 
asked people,

124
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,630
I'm sure if I asked you now and you 
think,

125
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,900
which sense of the five would you give 
up?

126
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,760
You know,
if you had to,

127
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,030
you're forced to.
People always say,

128
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,720
I give up sense of smell.
They think not so important,

129
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,540
but they're wrong.
They're actually fundamentally wrong.

130
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,300
Sense of smell is very important.
Is that the oldest one?

131
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,500
Yeah,
I think it.

132
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,950
I think it is.
And and paramecium bacteria in our,

133
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,240
in a jar have got receptors that respond
to orders.

134
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,480
So you know from the simplest animal up,
smell is important.

135
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:35,990
Now what?
Why?

136
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,160
Why is smell important?
Well,

137
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,960
it's,
it's used to give you a sense of danger.

138
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,660
If there's smoke predators,
if you are an animal,

139
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,943
we use it for attraction.
So it turns out that you are most 

140
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:55,361
attracted to people who smell suggests 
that their immune system is further away

141
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,500
from yours.
So we're,

142
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,880
we actually are,
are not attracted to people who smell is

143
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,610
going to indicate that there are too 
close to us genetically,

144
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:06,380
that their immune system is too close to
us.

145
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,543
So you know,
you might find yourself talking to 

146
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:10,280
somebody and you think,
oh,

147
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,350
you know,
they are very attractive,

148
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,910
they're very lovely,
very beautiful,

149
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,700
but if they smell wrong,
there's nothing you can do,

150
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,860
there's nothing you can do to over come 
that.

151
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,203
And on the other hand you might have 
people you suddenly feel very attracted 

152
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:26,450
to and you wonder why.
And it could be love at first smell.

153
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,900
So your sense of smell is,
is about attraction.

154
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,460
It's also about recognizing your kin.
If we give you a tee shirt,

155
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,170
a that your infant has had on,
you will know it's yours.

156
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,270
You will know that an equally,
you know,

157
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:46,271
the infant will be able to tell that 
that's the mother there in front of it,

158
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:51,050
from the sense of smell more so at first
than from sight.

159
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,890
And smell is also one of those things 
that tells us that everything is okay.

160
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,970
So you no longer smell your own home.

161
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,260
Everybody else's homes got smell but 
yours doesn't wise.

162
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,570
That's kind of funny right around this 
unite,

163
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,900
like while you're telling me they stuff,
giving you ideas.

164
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,210
Well and also reminding me of stuff.
Like what?

165
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,310
Like I remember as I'm sure everybody 
does when you're a kid and you go around

166
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:18,510
other people's houses,
you smell it,

167
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,020
smell of fish fingers in.
So it was a beef burgers and you know,

168
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,780
you remember your friend's houses and 
you're a member.

169
00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:27,614
You're relative sizes,
you know how they smell and you and yet 

170
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:30,770
you think yours doesn't.
That's funny.

171
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,550
So what's happened is that you're so 
used to the smell of your own home.

172
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:38,420
You've switched that off,
but it doesn't mean it doesn't mean it's

173
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,510
gone entirely because if you go into 
your home and say,

174
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,100
oh,
someone's been in here,

175
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,830
someone's been smoking,
or did I leave the rubbish out?

176
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:48,260
You know,
so you're on it like that.

177
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,313
So we're touching upon,
I suppose to the idea that the sensory 

178
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:57,021
realm is establishing norms that we 
neglect information once we've judged it

179
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:00,570
to be standardized.
Yeah,

180
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,573
I think,
I think in particular that's right with 

181
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:03,914
smell,
because you might think that smells job 

182
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,240
is to detect change.
If nothing's changed,

183
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,950
leave it alone.
Why?

184
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,843
Why?
Why put the brainpower into maintaining 

185
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:16,790
a permanent of factory landscape the way
we do with a visual landscape?

186
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,450
Why do that?
If it's not checkers?

187
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,090
Still Beef Burgers,
beef burgers,

188
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:24,110
still slightly pointless data.
That's ketchup.

189
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,390
I don't need to bother,
right?

190
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,160
But also remember that when we talked 
about food,

191
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,203
your sense of smell is actually the most
important sense for getting flavor from 

192
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:34,050
food,

193
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,883
so without smell,
they experience of gastronomy or 

194
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:40,110
cuisines.
Nothing is nothing.

195
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,153
In fact,

196
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,413
all you get,
all you can get if you had your a nose 

197
00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:49,730
clip on and we can put a pinch your nose
tightly shot and try eating things.

198
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,070
All your gets what the tongue provides 
salt,

199
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,450
sweet,
sour,

200
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,610
bitter,
savory.

201
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,120
That's it,
and yet you can taste cherry,

202
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,410
pineapple,
mango,

203
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,244
strawberry.
You don't have strawberry receptors on 

204
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:04,880
your tongue.
That's all coming from smell.

205
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,043
So if we took your sense of smell away,
that's all lost and you often get 

206
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,360
patients going to the doctor,
certainly an older age and they say,

207
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,000
I've lost my sense of taste.
Now a good doctor will say,

208
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,250
put your tongue out.
Here's a bit of lemon juice,

209
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:22,380
or here's a bit of salt to taste that,
oh yeah,

210
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,830
taste that,
but that's all I can taste,

211
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,873
and now they realize how much of what 
they thought was taste is actually due 

212
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:29,204
to smell.

213
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,770
It also seems very that the sensory 
realm,

214
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,633
it is highly collaborative and this is 
analogous to what we're learning about 

215
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,950
neurology and psychology.
I suppose that it's not like this is the

216
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:48,260
bit of the brain that deals with fear.
This is the bit of the brain.

217
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,213
The centers are collaborating to create 
a perception of reality in ways that 

218
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,190
with them we may have imagined they 
really

219
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,881
are so,
so.

220
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,530
So that's the second big thing.
You know,

221
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,870
one thing is giving up five,
many more than five,

222
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:03,460
and the second thing is saying their 
senses are massively interacting.

223
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,560
You almost never have an experience.
That's just in one sense modality.

224
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,113
In fact,
the arts is the place where we think 

225
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,750
that happens.
You go to a gallery and you think,

226
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,520
oh,
I'm just using my eyes,

227
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,510
but in fact you're aware of the 
acoustics in the gallery.

228
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,570
That's why if you're in a very big room 
with a high ceiling,

229
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:24,550
it's very different from being in a kind
of small,

230
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,830
tight space,
looking at the same painting.

231
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,010
You're also aware of the smell of the 
gallery.

232
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,220
I'm coming back smell one of my favorite
galleries where I grew up in Glasgow,

233
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,453
a art gallery and Museum Kelvin Grove,
and when it went in for a 40 million 

234
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:43,870
pound refit and it closed for many 
years,

235
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:46,300
the Glaswegians all said,
don't change the smell.

236
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,600
Don't change the smell because they had 
been there as kids.

237
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,740
They had gone back as adults.
They had taken their own kids and it was

238
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:57,430
that familiar smell of old stone and 
furniture Polish,

239
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,670
which they wanted because it was part of
their childhood.

240
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:03,430
It's part of their memory and so the 
sensors,

241
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,610
the sensors do make up the world.
They don't work separately,

242
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:08,770
but let me show you some of the 
interactions.

243
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,850
I mean there are weird ones,
so there are odors and shampoo that make

244
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:15,400
your hair feel softer.
Who Knew?

245
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,960
So that sort of green apple you 
sometimes get in shampoos.

246
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,190
It will sensitize,
touch at the end of your fingers to make

247
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:27,910
everything seem really soft and squeaky 
and lovely.

248
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,570
There are interactions between how 
things look and how they taste.

249
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,240
So if I give you two bottles of juice 
and and they've,

250
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,410
they're just,
it's just water with some sugar,

251
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:43,480
a little bit of sugar in it.

252
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,460
One of them is lime green color died and
the other is red color dyed.

253
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,110
You're convinced that the rate is sweet 
and the lime colored is sour,

254
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,610
so your eyes are overruling what your 
tongue is telling you.

255
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,803
So there's this way in which the senses 
are talking to each other and affecting 

256
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:05,110
each other.
Another nice example,

257
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,990
my friend and collaborator,
Charles Spence and Oxford,

258
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,360
he gives people two bowls of yogurt and 
you get these,

259
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,700
these bowls of yogurt and it's the same 
yogurt in both bowls,

260
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,150
but in one of them there's a little 
weight at the bottom of it,

261
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,000
so it's heavier.
Now I hand you the first bowl,

262
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:25,270
try that yogurt and do the second bold 
try that.

263
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:27,680
You'll get which ones creamier,
rich,

264
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,520
thicker,
and everybody says it's the one that had

265
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:31,354
the little weight in it.
So touch the weight in your hand is 

266
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:36,154
giving you a brain inflammation that it 
uses to say usually something that's 

267
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:44,020
creamier and thicker is a bit heavier.
So if I'm getting something heavier,

268
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,030
it must be creamier,
thicker.

269
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,193
So that's the way in which the other 
senses are working to give you an 

270
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:51,470
estimate of what's going on around you.

271
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,843
Much of our conversation thus far has 
been about how the senses can be 

272
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:58,940
deceived.
All those senses,

273
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:03,941
I suppose operate on detecting patterns,
consistency or differences you said,

274
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,100
and constant begin to be,
uh,

275
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,070
negate or ignored.
So,

276
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:11,843
uh,
what is initially quite interesting to 

277
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:14,634
me is that sensors are our never 
navigational tools for what is reality 

278
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:24,981
and if our senses are to a point 
unreliable or only reliable to a point,

279
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,570
then what is our relationship with 
reality,

280
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,130
how it affect.
So

281
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:36,350
I think it's interesting that we often 
don't know how our experiences.

282
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,680
We often don't realize that our,
our experience's multisensory,

283
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,053
you know,
people think I'm seeing now I'm hearing 

284
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,800
and I'm touching,
but in fact as we sit here,

285
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:48,950
no,
you're looking at my face,

286
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:49,784
you're hearing my voice.
You've maybe got the residual taste of 

287
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:54,020
tea or coffee in your mouth.
Those,

288
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:57,270
the smell of this room,
it's its own particular ordering.

289
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,030
You must know her very well.
And,

290
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,690
and all of that information is not 
coming in separate parcels.

291
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:04,030
No ice,
no out here.

292
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,873
Now I touch.
It's all unified in a single conscious 

293
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,423
experiences,
a unified view of you and the world 

294
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:14,290
around,
you know,

295
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,453
when people have brain damage or brain 
injury and you take out some of those 

296
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,150
multisensory inputs if you remove them,
things can go wrong.

297
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:31,670
And then what gets unified as something 
that seems very strange to them,

298
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,773
very odd.

299
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,530
A lot of people just after having had a 
stroke,

300
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,230
uh,
where you know,

301
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,130
the,
the,

302
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:39,963
the say their left arm is paralyzed.
They're not getting the right feedback 

303
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,463
to know that they are ms dot paralyzed.
And some of them people who have as as 

304
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:51,670
it's called,
I know sick nausea,

305
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,880
think that they've still got movement 
with both of their hands.

306
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,620
And you say to somebody,
you know,

307
00:16:57,621 --> 00:17:00,530
can you lift your right hand?
And the yes and they do.

308
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,050
Can you lift your left hand?
They say yes,

309
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,520
but the arm's not moving,
but they don't know it's not moving.

310
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,930
And so from the outside we think that's 
really strange.

311
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,910
But what,
what the brain is doing is saying,

312
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:15,860
well,
I'm whatever signals I've got,

313
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,790
I'm going to try and make sense of them 
in the best way I can.

314
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,373
And I think,
I think you see the brain's job as 

315
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,810
putting information together and trying 
to make sense of it.

316
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,890
You see it yourself when you're 
dreaming.

317
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,060
So you've noticed in a dream,
really weird things happen.

318
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,010
You're inside,
you're outside,

319
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,110
you're in a car,
you're in water.

320
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,970
This is a man,
now it's a woman.

321
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,920
Uh,
I'm suddenly in a different location.

322
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,610
And the interesting thing is that during
the dream that doesn't seem odd at all.

323
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,600
You just go with it is when you wake.
You think that was very weird.

324
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,080
I was a bit strange.
So when you're in the dream,

325
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,283
you go with all those strange 
distortions and a colleague of mine 

326
00:17:59,471 --> 00:18:00,304
said,
he thinks dreaming is the best way for 

327
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,950
the rest of us to know what it's like to
be brain damaged,

328
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:11,310
where you're getting false and or wrong 
signals from your senses,

329
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,810
but the brain is still trying to make 
sense of them.

330
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,763
That's why in the dream you'll put up 
with all sorts of weird things going on 

331
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:21,630
and in the dream it won't seem strange.
So

332
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,480
the sensors are the tools by which we 
determine reality.

333
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,540
There are various ways of disrupting our
sensual sensory experience.

334
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,670
Recently,
for example,

335
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:37,660
professor either go on a virtual reality
helmet is a mate of mine.

336
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,900
I was on in about five minutes.
I come out of that thing.

337
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,770
It might,
but this is all bullshit.

338
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,120
We really sort of affected my sense of 
connection to reality.

339
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,370
It made me query how valid it was,
um,

340
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,560
to analyze that to your example of the 
dream state on awakening.

341
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,200
I often feel this is a confection and 
some of these experimental examples that

342
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:06,844
you provided or this is a nice creamy 
yogurt or was tails the apocryphal or 

343
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:12,490
otherwise that I've heard of,
you know,

344
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:15,880
if you spell rubbish or suddenly likely 
to be more conserving here,

345
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,110
more pro the legal intervention.
So,

346
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,623
uh,
I suppose what I'm fascinated by them 

347
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,293
and what surely must drive much of your 
exploration is that to what degree is 

348
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:35,480
there an objective reality?
It's so easily alterable and modified.

349
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,920
I think there is an objective reality.
I mean,

350
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:38,490
I'm,
I'm,

351
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,040
I'm perfectly up for that.
It,

352
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,140
you know,
I'm completely up for that.

353
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:43,974
I mean,
I think,

354
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,180
I think,
I think,

355
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:46,380
yeah,
I think the idea that,

356
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,450
uh,
you know,

357
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,500
it's all subjective and it's all going 
on in my head.

358
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,963
We,
the world has a habit of impressing 

359
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,490
itself on us.
You know,

360
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:55,200
we,
we can't resist what it does.

361
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,093
And when you said you had the virtual 
reality helmet on and it was very 

362
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:01,360
convincing,
two things about one is when you get the

363
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:02,194
virtual reality helmet on,
it's pretty important that you don't 

364
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,740
move,
that you sit still with a helmet and you

365
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:09,030
can turn your head,
that's fine.

366
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,730
But when people try to move around a 
room,

367
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:17,180
they're getting a mismatch between the 
visual flow in the virtual reality scene

368
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,310
and what their body is telling them 
about where they are in space.

369
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,990
Even if there's not an object just with 
their people then get really quite ill.

370
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,160
Um,
so,

371
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,350
uh,
in Disneyland,

372
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:29,184
in Paris,
when people are in this tilting a 

373
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:38,150
spacecraft and they've got this 
streaming of stars coming and they're in

374
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:39,684
a star wars scene,
they're going in and out of buildings 

375
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:43,710
and they're moving to the side and 
they're tipping upwards and backwards.

376
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,933
So I'm going terribly well until when 
the film gets out of sequence with the 

377
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,414
movements,
they call that Code v because people 

378
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:52,594
just start vomiting as soon as they're 
not getting the body feeling that the 

379
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:57,664
visuals are giving them an.
That shows you why to be in touch with 

380
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,470
reality in the right way.
Yes,

381
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:02,304
senses.
I've got to work together and they've 

382
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,410
got to give you a lot together.
Fix.

383
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,563
And,
and the only thing about visual route 

384
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,620
is,
you know,

385
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:12,040
the sense that maybe that maybe we rely 
on for reality,

386
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:12,940
most is touch.

387
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,200
I mean if you see something and you're a
little bit doubtful about it,

388
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,200
you know,
think of Macbeth looking at the dagger,

389
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,990
is this a dagger I see before me,
but I cannot grasp it.

390
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,270
He wants to touch it to see if it's 
real.

391
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,430
He's not going to take it that just 
because he's,

392
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,660
he's,
he's leaking,

393
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,430
it's real.
And if people say,

394
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,013
Oh,
I was pretty sure there was a ghostly 

395
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:34,330
figure.
Well they want to do is they want to put

396
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:37,000
their hand in it.
So our sense of touch,

397
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,260
even though we rely most on sight sensor
touches,

398
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,240
one of those,
I think gives us more confidence that we

399
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:45,880
really are connected to an objective 
reality out there.

400
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,750
I wonder if this is underwritten by the 
idea of rational materialism.

401
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,270
Wow.
That's a big thought.

402
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,850
And that unpack that for me,
a little cry fest,

403
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,060
but it was a beautiful little dot.

404
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,550
Unpack that for me a little.
Well,

405
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,393
Barry,
what I feel is that it really beginning 

406
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:05,794
to see,
whilst you say there is an objective 

407
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:08,734
reality and I certainly can't provide 
any evidence that any reason it'd be 

408
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:12,154
difficult for me to do that it seems 
that there is a forms that are gay that 

409
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,743
are verified more quickly.
It's difficult to query that we live in 

410
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:24,510
a culture that is materialist and that 
means just incentive consumerism is that

411
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,350
rationalism.
What can be measured,

412
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:27,184
what can be rezoned to post 
enlightenment thinking governs our 

413
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,500
times,
our politics,

414
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,640
our economics.
So it seems to me that the,

415
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,650
the US ideologically placing precedent 
on I can touch it,

416
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,120
I can spend it,
I can fuck.

417
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:48,121
It seems to me quite animalistic and it 
seems to me that given that presidents,

418
00:22:49,021 --> 00:22:51,820
he's quite a political idea rather than,
well,

419
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:54,880
I can see this dagger in my mind and 
perhaps other people will see daggers in

420
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:56,880
their mind and all the sides.

421
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,640
All right,
good,

422
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,340
good,
good,

423
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,130
good thought.
Let me,

424
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,870
let me get back to,
you know,

425
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,020
give us a cuddles.
Good look,

426
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:04,360
because rationalism,
as you're saying,

427
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,223
the kind of rational economic drivers,
especially among economists who used to 

428
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:09,490
think of us as,
well,

429
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,120
we're rational decision makers.
You know,

430
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:15,760
we're,
we've got economic preferences and we'll

431
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:16,594
figure out what we want and you'll be 
able to assess what people are more 

432
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:19,684
likely to buy in,
in terms of what they believe and what 

433
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,380
they desire.
And you'll just,

434
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,243
you'll just do rational decision theory,
terrible idea because we're much more 

435
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:28,414
moved by our bodies and you have a 
little bit of a fight back against 

436
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:33,094
rationalism when you realize we're 
embodied creatures and if we're paying 

437
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:38,470
attention,
not just to,

438
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,910
you know,
our senses,

439
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,720
bringing information from the outside,
but say your heart.

440
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,943
So lovely.
Work new work by Sarah Garfinkel and 

441
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,124
Hugo critchley in Sussex showing that 
there's enormously interesting 

442
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:54,440
connections between the heart and the 
brain.

443
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,110
When every,
every time the heart beats,

444
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,520
it sends a signal to the brain and the 
brain has got a representation of all of

445
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:04,130
its organs.
The slow waves of the stomach,

446
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,210
the liver,
everything.

447
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,613
And it's.
And it's giving you an estimate of how 

448
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:11,480
things are with you.
So here's the funny thing,

449
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,523
some people can use that signal from 
their heart to estimate how they're 

450
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:20,470
doing and then that way to know their 
emotions better.

451
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,993
So people who are good at being in tune 
with how the heart's rhythm is and how 

452
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,380
it's beating.
They feel their emotions,

453
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,283
their emotions more intensely,
and they're quicker and better able to 

454
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:35,950
detect emotions in others.
And we often say,

455
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,470
if people are good at this,
we often say,

456
00:24:38,471 --> 00:24:39,220
well,
there,

457
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,100
they've got good instincts or they're 
going on gut instinct.

458
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,680
So we now are beginning to understand 
what that might mean.

459
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,873
And I think that's been neglected.
And I think when you imagine in the 

460
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:53,080
rational economic model that people are 
going to behave in the,

461
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,340
um,
you know,

462
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:58,330
the most reasonable way to get what they
want given what they believe in desire.

463
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,840
You're leaving out the sense of from 
time to time.

464
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,120
How are they feeling?
How anxious are they?

465
00:25:04,121 --> 00:25:05,620
How,
how upset,

466
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:06,454
high relaxed I come.
And the people who really can pay 

467
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:10,834
attention to that heart signal,
they're the ones who are going to be 

468
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,193
more in tune with them and maybe less 
taken in by all the attractions and the 

469
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:21,990
distractions that materialistic world 
throws at them.

470
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,193
Yes.
Because we live in a world is 

471
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:29,590
overstimulating,
and just with your shampoo example,

472
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,510
you touched upon how I'm

473
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,473
necessarily mark in Hasta mislead 
overstimulate over demonstrate the 

474
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:43,410
capacities of certain products.
Consumerism,

475
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:44,244
in a sense,
he's built upon the idea that a product 

476
00:25:47,251 --> 00:25:51,030
can deliver an experience that's beyond 
the rational.

477
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,760
Yeah.
It's all about experience.

478
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:55,130
So people in marketing no longer talk 
about products.

479
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:55,964
They talk about experiences really.
And they also have this new thing which 

480
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,123
is interesting.
They talk about we must get beyond 

481
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:04,220
liking.
It's not about liking,

482
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:06,920
it's about an emotional attachment to 
the product.

483
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,173
So if you can get somebody sort of 
emotionally engaged as people are with 

484
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:15,440
their equipment in a apple Mac users,
an iphone users,

485
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,600
they're really emotionally invested in 
it.

486
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:19,340
It's not.
It's not just a that's good.

487
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:20,810
That's useful.
I like that it works.

488
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,213
There's an emotional attachment to it 
and you might even look sniffily at 

489
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:27,800
somebody sitting beside you in a cafe if
they are on a pc and not a Mac.

490
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,083
So,
so a lot of that is being cultured and 

491
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:33,680
cultivated.
That's right.

492
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,173
But I think there's,
we've got to be careful because while I 

493
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:41,530
think there's a lot of wow materialism 
that's about misleading people,

494
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,490
I also think it doesn't,
it's not,

495
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:49,140
it's not harmful if we think of better 
uses of,

496
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,420
of marketing,
not to mislead,

497
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:52,254
but to lead people to experiences that 
they want and they need and that they 

498
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,210
could,
that could be better.

499
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,440
Making People's food healthier,
making people eat less fat,

500
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:02,274
salt and sugar,
but not making it so horrible that they 

501
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:05,430
don't want to have it,
you know,

502
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:07,320
making something delicious,
desirable,

503
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,900
getting them to pay attention,
slow down,

504
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,590
be mindful of the food they're eating.
If we can think of ways of doing that,

505
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,100
you might give people experiences that 
were more satisfying and they'd be sated

506
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:22,350
sooner and they weren't constantly 
stimulated and craving,

507
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:22,951
you know,
give me more,

508
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:25,770
give me more.
Is that unlikely that that will happen?

509
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Because there is no imperative really 
other than profit and what?

510
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,410
Oh,
I don't know.

511
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,570
I mean,
I think there's an imperative,

512
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:34,760
certainly,
uh,

513
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,633
when,
when you see governments are very 

514
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:39,590
worried about the amount of money 
they're spending on,

515
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,950
on,
on obesity,

516
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,740
they're very worried about,
uh,

517
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,910
you know,
health risks to people.

518
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,590
Now government do really is the 
imperative for profit still in it.

519
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,423
You're in a different form.
It may be because they want them to be 

520
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:56,180
healthy and be able to contribute to the
picture being ill.

521
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,103
No,
to contribute to the capitalist culture 

522
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,300
at well,
enjoy life and,

523
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,330
and,
and work and,

524
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,940
and,
and spent well,

525
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,783
look,
I mean all of us want to try to slow 

526
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:10,350
down that cycle where we've made fruit 
so hyper palatable.

527
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:12,300
It's so delicious.
It's so full of salt,

528
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:14,460
fat,
sugar that people just want it,

529
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:15,294
want it,
want it.

530
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:20,040
And also it's not surprising to see 
obesity numbers grow,

531
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:24,450
especially in areas of poverty.
Now that's just not fair because,

532
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,151
you know,
we're,

533
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:27,000
we're,
we're advertising to people.

534
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:29,520
We're trying to get them to have these 
things,

535
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,570
which,
you know,

536
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,980
a lot of companies now are,
are bad few,

537
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,600
but you know,
people whose lives are hard,

538
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,793
they're,
you know,

539
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,320
they're sort of left out of the great 
race.

540
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,670
They're not feeling it's going to.
Well,

541
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:42,923
they are being encouraged just to dose 
themselves with something that's 

542
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:50,400
immediately gratifying.
Look at supermarket,

543
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,490
Look at supermarket advertising.
I think it's really pernicious.

544
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,950
So you've got.
You've got it really is.

545
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,780
I mean like you've got that thing.
I'm a taste the difference now.

546
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:01,614
What's that about?
That's about saying if you're a bit 

547
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:03,774
aspirational,
I'll offer you something a little more 

548
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:09,120
expensive and you will,
you will reward yourself by saying,

549
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,830
oh,
I was able to taste the difference.

550
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:13,340
I noticed this was better quality.
It's fine now.

551
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,920
So the other trying to get people to buy
something a little more it.

552
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,880
Which one is that?
Which,

553
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,960
which kind of makes sense.
Now the other thing that just,

554
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,020
just,
just,

555
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,080
just,
just bloody habit.

556
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:28,914
It's just habit.
It's what I'm worried about because at 

557
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:32,334
the bottom end of the range,
the people that they know are not going 

558
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:36,190
to pay more.
For our final question.

559
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,024
You're not going to be.
They've got products that they say be 

560
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:42,270
good to yourself and I think that are 
trainable.

561
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,830
Yeah,
look,

562
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,720
I bought donut.
Your life is.

563
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,613
Your life is pretty hard.
You're feeling oppressed and and hard 

564
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,900
pushed.
You can't manage things.

565
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,390
How about right now?
Just a little bit of comfort.

566
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:57,080
Take that fat and salt and sugar.
I think that's a terrible thing to do to

567
00:29:57,081 --> 00:29:57,914
people.
You're working in a fascinating area 

568
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,110
because the perhaps thinking about it 
now,

569
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:04,400
it seems like the most fascinating 
because these,

570
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,613
these are the roads between reality is 
one field that in reality as it is and 

571
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:13,810
that the unreliability of either of 
those preconditions,

572
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,230
what is self?
What is otherness?

573
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,090
The subjective and the objective and how
these two worlds a community.

574
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,103
How do you use that?
How does having access to this kind of 

575
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:29,850
incite change your life on a daily basis
or we should changed it

576
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:30,981
for the better.
I mean,

577
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:33,290
I'm like everybody else.
I'm as vulnerable to,

578
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,240
you know,
to mood changes or to,

579
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,820
to suddenly feeling hunger or to wanting
some gratification,

580
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:38,240
but you know,
when,

581
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,600
when I'm thinking it through,
I'm realizing that,

582
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,380
you know,
if,

583
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,080
if,
if things are going well inside of me,

584
00:30:45,081 --> 00:30:48,540
if I'm not having bad reactions,
um,

585
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,503
and I,
and I feel that I'm kinda getting okay 

586
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:52,060
with the people around me,
the,

587
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:54,770
and the things around me.
I must be in tune this.

588
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:59,120
This is where the subject of an object 
of our gear shifted to fit each other.

589
00:30:59,121 --> 00:31:01,540
That's nice,
but it often comes astray.

590
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,610
I mean,
people are sleeping badly.

591
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,180
People are eating more than they want.
People are drinking more than they want.

592
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,130
Um,
why is that happening?

593
00:31:10,131 --> 00:31:13,250
And it's happening because of the 
stresses and strains,

594
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,103
the,
the feeling of being left out and you 

595
00:31:16,431 --> 00:31:17,440
see people,
you know,

596
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,473
the dispossessed that cheated of 
sunlight just being offered really bad 

597
00:31:21,501 --> 00:31:22,040
goods.

598
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,620
Really kind of simple,
immediate pleasures.

599
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,220
Now can we encourage people out of that?
You've got to get them very young.

600
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:29,054
It's got to be in schools.
It's got to be a way in which you get 

601
00:31:30,501 --> 00:31:35,501
people to be interested in not just a 
screen or or headphones,

602
00:31:36,651 --> 00:31:38,840
but,
but think of the other senses as well.

603
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,293
Think of the way in which you could get 
kids to be interested in what they're 

604
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:45,560
eating and picking out part and being 
kind of,

605
00:31:45,561 --> 00:31:46,970
you know,
thoughtful and,

606
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,833
and,
and a good at describing it and being 

607
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:50,534
critical.
In France they do this little kids are 

608
00:31:52,821 --> 00:31:53,654
asked about the age of eight to,
to ask their parents to send them into 

609
00:31:57,411 --> 00:31:58,244
school with some unusual thing to eat.
Maybe an unusual fruit or an unusual 

610
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:03,734
cake or whatever and the other kids are 
asked to try it and they're there to 

611
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:08,330
talk about it and they see,
oh,

612
00:32:08,331 --> 00:32:10,370
that's interesting.
That's a bit like pineapple.

613
00:32:10,371 --> 00:32:11,204
And you watch these little kids getting 
fascinated because they're learning 

614
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,490
about the foods,
but they're learning about themselves,

615
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:17,324
their own reactions.
That's getting them better in tune to 

616
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,223
what's good for me,
not just what is everybody telling me I 

617
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:24,200
should well until she'd have.

618
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,333
Can you sense though,
professor that places the onus on the 

619
00:32:27,441 --> 00:32:29,510
individual and that is this a lot like,
well,

620
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:32,910
if you want to mark it to be a better,
you should be a demand.

621
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:36,230
There's a consumer,
a recycling aisle where things are a bit

622
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:39,860
more expensive when we all know that 
this is gonna be social,

623
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:39,980
it's

624
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,660
a social,
it's a social problem,

625
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,793
but we just think of we're getting 
better now at thinking about social 

626
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,480
factors that affect us.
Um,

627
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,240
so neuroscience used to be all about the
individual brain,

628
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,303
you know,
it was a very individualist sort of 

629
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:56,330
discipline.
You're thinking,

630
00:32:56,331 --> 00:32:57,164
you know,
what's going on in the brain of this 

631
00:32:58,491 --> 00:33:01,400
person and how are they reacting to the 
inputs and the stimuli,

632
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,960
how are they likely to behave?
But now there's social neuroscience.

633
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:06,794
People are really interested in how 
you're affected when having experiences 

634
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:11,714
by the presence of another person.
I mean we all know if we're sitting in 

635
00:33:14,511 --> 00:33:15,344
front of a screen watching a film,
it's not the same experience as if we 

636
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:18,404
were side by side with people around us.
If we were kind of sharing that and you 

637
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,353
know,
setting up experiments where you're 

638
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:29,561
trying to see the extent to which people
are aware of one another's reactions and

639
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:31,454
judgments and that's a,
that's a way of tuning their own being 

640
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:35,174
sort of emotionally regulated,
not just by yourself but by how it's 

641
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,523
going with other people,
how much pain I feel and how I react to 

642
00:33:42,201 --> 00:33:43,034
pain will be affected by whether there's
someone present in the room with me and 

643
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:47,804
also whether they're a relative and 
whether this is someone I take care 

644
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:51,860
over,
they take care of me.

645
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,630
So I think there's,
there's,

646
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,450
there's a kind of sense in which we have
been very individual,

647
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,284
but we're getting better now at looking 
at how socially things are organized 

648
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,263
because these are further suggestions 
that there are modifications to our 

649
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:10,220
perception that are difficult to 
mechanically account for.

650
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,500
They are difficult to mechanically 
account for.

651
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,910
But,
but here's the other thing.

652
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,390
When you're making perceptual judgments,
um,

653
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,450
you know,
is really boring.

654
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:21,320
You're in a,
you know,

655
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,183
we're in a scanner and you're just 
watching a set of images being flashed 

656
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:29,240
up and you're asked,
is the one in the left brighter than the

657
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:30,074
one on the right or you know,
tell us which one's brighter and you're 

658
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:33,104
just pressing buttons.
If you get people to do that 

659
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:37,820
individually,
a,

660
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,030
they'll come out with a score,
how accurate they are,

661
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:46,360
but we are now looking at new research 
where if people make their judgments and

662
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:51,470
express their confidence rating,
how confident were you that that you got

663
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:52,304
that right?

664
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:57,310
Seventy percent or 80 percent and then 
people having done this individually are

665
00:34:57,981 --> 00:34:58,814
allowed to discuss with each other what 
their judgments were and to share their 

666
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:07,841
confidence ratings and then you ask them
to come up with a collective decision.

667
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,313
Turns out that the payers are better 
than the strongest of the two peers 

668
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,890
doing it individually.
In other words,

669
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:19,610
two brains are better than one.
When you're making perceptual judgments,

670
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,593
if you're a light to discuss it,
you'll arrive at a better judgement if 

671
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,613
you do it together.
Now just think of that and the 

672
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:31,820
consequences that has in general that a 
lot of the decision making that we go in

673
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:35,090
for probably if we were allowed to 
discuss it with people,

674
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,950
but it's got to be discussed in a way 
where,

675
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,630
you know,
nobody is dominating the discussion.

676
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:43,920
Nobody's taking it over to brains being 
better than one is a,

677
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,020
is a kind of new view because it,
it,

678
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,820
it affects not just,
uh,

679
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,420
thoughts about society,
but even our perceptions,

680
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,283
even our perceptions might be improved 
if we're light to discuss them with 

681
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:56,070
people of reality itself.

682
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:00,480
I have a cool something that Eei,
he said when we spoke,

683
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,750
uh,
that there is no self.

684
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:04,584
We exist in dialectic.
What is reality if you're in an hour 

685
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:10,200
minium,
captual drifting through space,

686
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,034
which I suppose is a way of physically 
recreating the idea of a world stripped 

687
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:15,114
of senses,
a world stripped of virtuous to 

688
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,370
otherness.
Do you meditate?

689
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,690
No,
I'm a,

690
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,970
I do other things that get me into that 
state.

691
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:28,290
So,
so here's what I don't meditate.

692
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:29,124
I'll tell you why I don't.
So I remember when I was a much younger 

693
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:36,390
academic and feeling all the pressures 
and very stressed and you know,

694
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,060
suffering all the things that high 
stress will get stress.

695
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,580
Well,
stress because you're under pressure,

696
00:36:42,581 --> 00:36:45,270
you go to publish and you've got to what
you're working on.

697
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,860
At this point I,
I was,

698
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,200
I was doing very technical philosophy of
language and logic and so it was.

699
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,290
And you're aware of your own science.
Very interesting.

700
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,900
But I was glad when I started working 
on,

701
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,123
uh,
the connections to the sensors and 

702
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:02,280
started working in psychology,
neuroscience.

703
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,800
It's great to collaborate.
I love collaborative work.

704
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,910
You're not alone.
But,

705
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,800
but before that,
when I was a younger academic,

706
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,430
philosophers often work in their own 
study on their own,

707
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,570
having the hard thoughts having to come 
up with something that's original.

708
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:16,404
That's good,
that's clear.

709
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,880
But under those sorts of pressures I was
getting very,

710
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:21,900
very stressed and doctors would say to 
me,

711
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,700
I think you should meditate.
And I thought,

712
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:24,170
okay,
I'll,

713
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,560
I'll try that.
That may be coming down.

714
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,080
And then what they do is they tell you,
you know,

715
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,700
you're,
you're lying on the floor,

716
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,070
your eyes are closed,
you're very calm,

717
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,150
and I want you to concentrate on the 
word relax.

718
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,840
And of course I'm a philosopher of 
language and thinking the word relaxed.

719
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,580
It's like relax.
But it's not actually combined a relax.

720
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,330
And I'm starting,
my mind is just racing,

721
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:47,550
thinking about the bloody word.
So I thought,

722
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:49,800
that's no good.
That's not going to work for me.

723
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:54,600
What I need to do is turn words off.
I've got to make sure that,

724
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,730
you know,
I'm not having a word,

725
00:37:57,731 --> 00:38:01,080
the conversations that restless internal
monologue that's going on.

726
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:01,914
So do I do that.
And for me it's always been looking at 

727
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:07,000
paintings and I would,
you know,

728
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:07,834
get myself along to the national gallery
or wherever was close and I would spend 

729
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,793
a very long time in front of a painting 
until the voices in my head commenting 

730
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:22,470
on it,
noting things calm down.

731
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:27,420
And there's a moment when you stop sort 
of competing with what you're looking at

732
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:31,350
and you stop giving your own imposition 
and you just let.

733
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,243
What's their come to you and then you 
begin to really see what the artists or 

734
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,813
you begin to just let a painting speak 
and at that point the word SCO and it's 

735
00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:45,314
a lovely meditative,
calm state and I and I remain sort of 

736
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:50,844
emotionless,
very peaceful in that state and it's 

737
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:54,534
very interesting that I must give off 
something because people who are 

738
00:38:57,901 --> 00:39:00,810
inclined to sort of walk in front of you
and the painting,

739
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,033
they sort of noticed me and they make 
around the back as if not wanting to 

740
00:39:05,581 --> 00:39:10,581
interrupt and I think that's the nearest
I can get to kind of meditative state.

741
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:16,540
It feels very good and the body feels 
very grateful.

742
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:18,044
I think in some way for being in that 
state because everything has calmed 

743
00:39:20,511 --> 00:39:23,240
down.
The level of adrenaline has dropped.

744
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:26,420
You're not on a layer,
you're not sort of ready to react

745
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,703
for you.
Then it's difficult to surrender their 

746
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:30,434
process of analysis and adjudication.
But as you described the process of 

747
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:39,520
looking at a painting,
you seem to me that you were saying that

748
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,710
eventually you kind of melt into an 
experience of the creator,

749
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,440
loss of self,
which my own experience of meditation is

750
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,060
somewhat about achieving sensory 
experience.

751
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:58,090
Perhaps could be regarded as this 
forcing one's position.

752
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,200
I am here.
I can smell that.

753
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:01,034
I can see that.
I can hear that if that vibrations 

754
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,910
bouncing back at me,
it means I'm in this kind of environment

755
00:40:04,911 --> 00:40:07,670
and those early example you gave of how 
we react to that,

756
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,160
the device that makes our footsteps 
louder,

757
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:15,110
it means that we continually 
reevaluating the parameters of self,

758
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,910
what we are,
who we are.

759
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,763
I'm very interested in challenging the 
relationship between between self and 

760
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:26,060
reality because I'm curious about who 
authors,

761
00:40:26,061 --> 00:40:26,894
what reality is and what our role is.
We talked already of the way that 

762
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:31,004
different supermarket brands would mark 
it at their potential customers who is 

763
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,210
designated in a kind of casual net crow 
politics to eat the salty,

764
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:43,900
fatty foods and who can eat the lash 
tasteful goods.

765
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,820
I'm assuming if you don't meditate,
and I have not for years,

766
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,450
but uh,
um,

767
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:53,060
taken psychedelics,
I wonder if you're curious about your,

768
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,110
uh,
with your knowledge of neuroscience,

769
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,600
about the,
how Oh,

770
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,190
mind altering substances and what they,
if what can be a.

771
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,090
So I think they are interesting and I 
think the,

772
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,900
there's a lot of interest in them in the
field of psychiatry,

773
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,000
neuroscience at the moment now because 
you get that.

774
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,110
Uh,
I mean,

775
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:17,010
like I,
I can,

776
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,060
I can remember when,
you know,

777
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,260
when you're hideously drunk and you're 
really,

778
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,153
really off your face and your eyes look 
one way and then when you move them you 

779
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:29,354
feel the image didn't quite come with 
you at the right time and things are 

780
00:41:31,881 --> 00:41:32,714
sort of shuddering and you see what 
you're doing is breaking down the way 

781
00:41:35,121 --> 00:41:37,670
the sentence is normally cooperate with 
each other.

782
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,223
And at that point you probably start to 
get a dissolving of the boundaries of 

783
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:44,210
the self.
But no,

784
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,650
no,
not in a good way.

785
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,960
A good way.
And I think,

786
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,063
I think that is interesting to see how 
the self is not as some philosophers 

787
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:57,860
thought indissolvable single constantly 
present thing that was there.

788
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,230
Which philosophers think that,
well I mean Rene Descartes,

789
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,363
I think therefore I am.
And that self was a kind of enduring 

790
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:06,170
continuing presence.
That was,

791
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,033
that was you.
You could take all the bits of the body 

792
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:11,360
away and there would still be there 
self,

793
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:14,330
which was the thinking thing and it's,
it's,

794
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,253
it's absolutely not like that.
I mean the way in which our sense of 

795
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:19,754
self is composed of so many components 
and parts that all have to be working 

796
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:25,634
seamlessly together like an orchestra.
And then when they're unified you get 

797
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:32,960
that probably illusion that everything 
is,

798
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,890
is in a single unified space.
And,

799
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:41,040
and actually I think you look at people 
either with psychedelic drugs or again,

800
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,183
under extreme conditions of drink,
or you look at people with brain damage 

801
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,053
and you see the way in which some of 
those things are breaking down and that 

802
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:55,661
tells you that it's not so obvious that 
that sense of self is in a permanent and

803
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,630
reliably always going to be there.

804
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,260
It's fragile.
It could be disintegrated.

805
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:04,094
It could kind of fracture and fragment.
And when you see people with brain 

806
00:43:08,811 --> 00:43:10,010
damage,
I think,

807
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:11,960
uh,
you know,

808
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:12,823
people who disowned a limb or people who
neglect everything on the lefthand side 

809
00:43:17,871 --> 00:43:21,020
of their visual field or people who 
believe that they're dead.

810
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:23,870
Or people who,
who think that their relatives have been

811
00:43:23,871 --> 00:43:24,704
replaced with aliens or whatever.
Those cases are often used in a very 

812
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:33,020
annoying way.
Like a kind of a freak show circus where

813
00:43:33,021 --> 00:43:33,831
they say,
oh look,

814
00:43:33,831 --> 00:43:34,370
you know,
here's a,

815
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,350
here's a man who mistook his wife for a 
hat.

816
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:37,693
All of that stuff.
And I think what we should say instead 

817
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,113
when we look at people with these funny 
conditions is why aren't the rest of us 

818
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,800
not more like them?
Why is it that we don't have these weird

819
00:43:48,801 --> 00:43:51,800
and funny experiences and it's you know,
there,

820
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,400
there,
there,

821
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,440
but for the grace of God go,
I mean if,

822
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,333
if anything did breakdown of some of our
systems fail to deliver what they 

823
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:00,980
usually do and what we don't notice they
do.

824
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:06,340
You would get a fragmentation of the 
self and we would end up in the way that

825
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,423
a lot of patients describe her in the 
way that people who've been on lots of 

826
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,730
our to Jen's describe so,
so,

827
00:44:12,731 --> 00:44:13,564
so we,
we can be more sympathetic and more 

828
00:44:15,591 --> 00:44:17,120
understanding.
I think,

829
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:18,523
of other people not like us.
When we realized how much it takes to 

830
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:25,940
sustain this illusion that everything is
unified and self-like and present.

831
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,073
Furthermore,
only a non anomalous experiences 

832
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:31,950
wouldn't warrant

833
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,880
observation.
So we could be behaving in a way that is

834
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,400
collectively hysterical.
Yeah.

835
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:43,580
Without it ever causing a glitch on the 
graph because it's because of.

836
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,400
Because of our understanding of norms.
Have you got any interest in the sort of

837
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,713
changing morality,
changing norms tastes the role of taste 

838
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:57,470
as in like,
like this is good taste,

839
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,280
this is bad taste.
This is elegant,

840
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,473
elegant.
Yeah,

841
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,000
I have.
I mean I think.

842
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,220
I think that when you talked about 
norms,

843
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:06,054
that's interesting because that which is
most familiar we think is a permanent 

844
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,280
and has to be like that and it's only 
under conditions of brain damage or or,

845
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:19,210
or an extreme or unusual anomalous 
experience.

846
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,150
We suddenly realize,
oh my God,

847
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,850
it doesn't always have to be like that.
Things could change radically.

848
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,990
So I think the familiar is taken for 
granted.

849
00:45:28,991 --> 00:45:31,700
The familiar is taken as bedrock.
It'll always be like that.

850
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,593
This,
this is just what it is to be human and 

851
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:35,660
then we realize,
you know,

852
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,170
slightly late and to our shame it's not 
like that.

853
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:43,370
I think in terms of morals,
the something like the same issue here,

854
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,813
there's a lot of interest in,
in clinical neuroscience on people 

855
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:52,881
who've had brain damage leading to them 
behaving in some morally a porn way.

856
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,200
What like p two failures.
So there's a famous case,

857
00:45:58,201 --> 00:46:02,220
you probably heard about the case in 
Virginia where there's a man who,

858
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,083
who suddenly starts behaving 
inappropriate to his daughter and his 

859
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:09,234
wife report some and he gets sort of 
banged away and he's going to be given 

860
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:17,160
some remedial training,
but he's got these ptfe like thoughts,

861
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,900
but he's also complaining about 
headaches now.

862
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:19,734
They take them in to the hospital.
They eventually scanned him and find 

863
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:26,730
that he's got a huge tumor in the 
prefrontal Cortex,

864
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,600
orbital frontal cortex here and the 
operating,

865
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:33,000
the resect it,
and they take most of it out.

866
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,360
And then the pedophilic tendencies have 
gone away.

867
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:39,840
Now the tumor hadn't completely gone 
away.

868
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:43,950
It regrew and the pedophile tendencies 
come back and again,

869
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:44,784
he had to be incarcerated.
Now what's really interesting about him 

870
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,770
is that he knew it was bad to do this.

871
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,230
He tried to hide what he was doing and 
he just,

872
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,600
it's.
He says,

873
00:46:56,601 --> 00:46:59,390
couldn't stop himself doing it.
Now a lot of people,

874
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,750
lawyers get very worried about those 
cases because they say,

875
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:05,210
wow,
the lowest be a defense in court saying,

876
00:47:05,211 --> 00:47:06,830
you know,
my neurons made me do it.

877
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:11,480
It wasn't me golf,
but actually actually that's,

878
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:16,310
that's they don't realize that's worse 
because if somebody says I couldn't help

879
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:17,144
doing it,
you're probably going to incarcerate 

880
00:47:18,621 --> 00:47:21,410
them and keep them locked up for the 
safety of everybody around.

881
00:47:21,411 --> 00:47:23,480
It's not as though they're going to walk
out of court free.

882
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:24,523
If they say I couldn't.
I couldn't help myself that they're 

883
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,690
going to be in a restrained,
but what's interesting about his cases,

884
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:35,850
he knew it was wrong and then said,
but I had no way of controlling it.

885
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:41,650
Whereas we often tend to think of people
behaving in some morally apparent way.

886
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,840
They don't know the difference between 
right and wrong.

887
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,690
That's why they do it because they don't
know the difference.

888
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:49,270
They don't realize it's wrong.
Now here's somebody who knows it's wrong

889
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:53,440
and can't stop himself doing it,
so we realize a bit more like addiction.

890
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:56,260
There's something here which we need to 
separate out.

891
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,123
It's not enough just to have good 
intentions to know what's right or 

892
00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:01,024
wrong.
How are you going to have the means to 

893
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,470
be able to follow it up,
carry it out,

894
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,600
resist something,
not do that,

895
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,600
and we're relearning that.
It's a,

896
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,453
again,
it's an orchestration of lots of little 

897
00:48:11,591 --> 00:48:15,310
systems and if something goes wrong,
you're not in control of it.

898
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,153
You're inside of your reach is an 
interesting ethical question because I 

899
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:24,410
suppose it's to do with determinism and 
personal foreign aid if,

900
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,493
if at,
because I suppose perhaps in centuries 

901
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:32,230
to come that will be seen merely as a 
obvious example,

902
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:33,064
an outlier of the ways that all of our 
personal autonomy is being and the 

903
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,213
written or fueled by sort of 
neurological events that could be seen 

904
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:44,380
as a meet urology.

905
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,260
Just the weather of our consciousness.
I like that.

906
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:48,710
I think it is the weather of our 
conscious.

907
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,650
I think we're,
I think we,

908
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:50,663
we fluctuate and we're fickle.
It's not surprising therefore that 

909
00:48:52,841 --> 00:48:54,420
people,
uh,

910
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,330
are often compared to the weather,
you know,

911
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,760
because blue or stormy or sunny 
disposition.

912
00:49:00,761 --> 00:49:03,760
Yeah.
But also we're not very good.

913
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,400
Even though we've now got all these 
satellites and we're trying to predict,

914
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,780
we're not very good at predicting the 
weather.

915
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,063
Have you ever noticed when you get 
weather forecasts that the first thing 

916
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:12,640
someone who tells you is what happened 
today?

917
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:13,621
Well,
you know,

918
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:15,140
there's was a high,
uh,

919
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:16,623
it was very high pressure and the winds 
were coming in from the south and then 

920
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:19,690
that led to the,
you think,

921
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,250
I know what happened.
I was there.

922
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,180
What they're trying to do is build up 
your confidence that once it's happened,

923
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:26,283
they know why they can explain it and 
they're hoping that that will let you 

924
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,153
believe that they can now predict,
but things still happen in the weather 

925
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:34,090
that were not predicted.

926
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,150
And we suddenly had a rush of snow in 
the UK and boy,

927
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,950
nobody was expecting that.
It didn't.

928
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:40,780
I didn't hear the weather warnings about
it.

929
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,020
So I think people are the same.
Once somebody has,

930
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,790
has,
has acted.

931
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:46,624
Once they'd done something,
you can probably try and figure out why 

932
00:49:50,171 --> 00:49:51,004
they did it and an attribute motives.
But what we can't do is really predict 

933
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:55,540
what people will do.
I mean,

934
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:57,000
we're,
we're just really not good at that.

935
00:49:57,001 --> 00:49:58,650
That's why people are like the way there
we are.

936
00:49:58,651 --> 00:50:02,800
We're really not able to see in advance 
exactly what they'll do.

937
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:05,250
They'll have tendencies.
There'll be things that you,

938
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,780
you kind of expect them to do,
but I,

939
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:08,703
I like the fact that people can always 
behave out of character and you can 

940
00:50:15,401 --> 00:50:19,480
still make sense of it is challenges,
doesn't it?

941
00:50:19,481 --> 00:50:23,050
The systems of taxonomy that we put in 
place that are,

942
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:25,660
these group of people are likely to 
commit crimes.

943
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,493
These group of people that are there,
these people or be elevated and 

944
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,443
respected because there's too much 
complexity for these systems to be 

945
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:34,964
reliable and these categories are 
usually constructed with a particular 

946
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,500
narrative in mind.
They are an just that phrase,

947
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:43,700
these people.
I mean,

948
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:44,563
how dangerous does that sound when you 
decide that you're going to castigate a 

949
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:49,874
whole group of people as though you,
you know exactly what they're like and 

950
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:55,490
how they're going to behave.
Here's the terrifying thing.

951
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,470
The more that we get information from 
neuroscience in courts,

952
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:01,663
we see pictures of brains with areas 
that are lighting up and of course we 

953
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,790
know areas don't actually.
It'll light up.

954
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,730
This is just sale.
Yeah,

955
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,650
exactly,
and it's also how we create the pictures

956
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:16,450
that demonstrate where we think travel 
through language,

957
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:19,670
but the power of image and a court is 
very strong.

958
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,083
A lot of studies going on recently with 
Laura's neuroscientist showing that 

959
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:27,920
courts are incredibly moved by somebody 
flashing up,

960
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:29,063
you know,
an image inside a skull and here's a 

961
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,004
little patch of activity where it seems 
to be going orange and that's obviously 

962
00:51:33,921 --> 00:51:35,830
why somebody behaves like that's his 
says.

963
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:40,930
That's exactly what it is.
And of course what the public don't know

964
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:48,500
is that that image is not a single 
brain.

965
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:52,100
It's none of a single brain never is.
When you're doing scanning,

966
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,080
you get say 30 subjects,
your scan them all performing a task and

967
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:57,914
you scan them all when they're 
performing some contrast task and what 

968
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:06,581
you're looking at is a computer 
representation of the average brain that

969
00:52:08,451 --> 00:52:13,130
shows the average activity difference 
between performing one task and another.

970
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:17,780
So that's not an individual that's a,
that's a statistical generalization.

971
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:22,040
So while you might say,
look for any 30 people,

972
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,220
26 of them are definitely in this 
condition,

973
00:52:25,221 --> 00:52:26,054
going to behave this way,
there could be the one person who who 

974
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:30,944
want and who doesn't.
And I think when it comes to making 

975
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:36,140
decisions about people's individual 
liberty,

976
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:40,880
you're probably not wanting to go buy 
well statistically.

977
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,580
People like this have,
you know,

978
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,653
re-offended or whatever it is.
There's a study that was done in a New 

979
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,663
Mexico I think where they scanned the 
brains of a longterm inmates and then 

980
00:52:57,081 --> 00:53:00,170
had follow ups of when they were 
released,

981
00:53:00,171 --> 00:53:01,004
if they were paroled and whether the 
rear fender and it turned out that 

982
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:09,920
getting people to perform go nogo tasks 
where they're,

983
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:10,754
they're,
they're excited and ready to press a 

984
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:12,854
button,
but they might go to hourly and they 

985
00:53:13,701 --> 00:53:14,181
might,
you know,

986
00:53:14,181 --> 00:53:15,014
make an error.
People who had no impulse control or 

987
00:53:18,051 --> 00:53:19,400
very little impulse control,
they,

988
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:20,283
they,
they very little activation in the 

989
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:24,590
anterior singular singular cortex and 
the brain,

990
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:26,063
they reoffended more often,
more reliably than people who had 

991
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:34,720
greater activation and more impulse 
control.

992
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:39,160
Not turned out that when the study was 
done over I think a 10 year period,

993
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:40,903
the,
the neuro imaging scans gave something 

994
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:49,641
like 66 percent reliable judgment about 
whether someone was lightly to refund.

995
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,423
Whereas the parole board who are 
deciding it only had a success rate of 

996
00:53:55,011 --> 00:53:59,210
25 percent.
Now what do we do about that?

997
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,730
You kinda think,
look,

998
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,910
I'm,
you'd want to get better than 25 percent

999
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:05,744
of your guessing.
Should we let this person out now or 

1000
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,070
early or should we let them complete the
sentence?

1001
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:13,610
You want to do better than I'm 25 
percent right?

1002
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,380
That they'll,
they'll dreadfully low.

1003
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,600
So 66 is better.
And at the same time,

1004
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,273
again,
remember the scanning data is averaging 

1005
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,670
the result.
So you might say,

1006
00:54:26,671 --> 00:54:27,421
wow,
you know,

1007
00:54:27,421 --> 00:54:31,620
in general people with low activation 
here in the ACC,

1008
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,900
you know,
on average most of them will re offend,

1009
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,350
but if you're the one who's not part of 
that data,

1010
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,593
a summary,
are you going to stop that guy from 

1011
00:54:44,241 --> 00:54:46,580
being paroled?
Just because you say,

1012
00:54:46,581 --> 00:54:48,750
well,
on average people do so that,

1013
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:49,584
that raises.
I think for society that raises huge 

1014
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:52,340
moral problems,
this,

1015
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:53,203
this new knowledge is not neutral.
We have to make some really tough 

1016
00:54:56,571 --> 00:54:58,010
decisions about how we use it

1017
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:03,400
know so little is because of often where
funding comes from.

1018
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:04,234
There's a usually a bias in that area.
The incentives and objectives of 

1019
00:55:08,741 --> 00:55:13,741
particular institutions usually vested 
interests involved.

1020
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:18,670
A particular picture of reality is 
usually presented and preserved.

1021
00:55:18,671 --> 00:55:21,280
One of the things I've learned over my 
personal,

1022
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:22,323
I was personally incentivized to 
undertake a process of conducting these 

1023
00:55:24,911 --> 00:55:28,720
interviews because I do a degree in 
religion,

1024
00:55:28,721 --> 00:55:33,100
in global politics so vast,
and over the course of these interviews,

1025
00:55:33,101 --> 00:55:38,080
one of the things I've discovered and 
I'm sort of crystallizing in my mind,

1026
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:38,914
is the invisible caveat.
Unless it affects the interest of the 

1027
00:55:43,211 --> 00:55:44,044
powerful,
we must do something about climate 

1028
00:55:45,401 --> 00:55:48,700
change unless it affects the interests 
of the powerful.

1029
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,240
Every single conference,
that ongoing conversation,

1030
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,313
it has this obscured never discussed 
piece of information that we are driven 

1031
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,223
to conserve.
We are driven to keep institutions 

1032
00:56:02,741 --> 00:56:04,750
invested,
interests protected.

1033
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,793
Very seldom that they are challenged and
one of the ways I've noted that that 

1034
00:56:08,681 --> 00:56:12,160
happens is placing a great deal of 
owners on individual choice,

1035
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:14,790
well,
these people have done that and that you

1036
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:15,643
know,
like that rather than acknowledging the 

1037
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:22,800
role of states or transnational 
organizations in influencing people's.

1038
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:24,783
So the work that you do where in in its 
complexity and understanding the 

1039
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:30,334
mechanics of the relationship between 
Invokana as an individual and an 

1040
00:56:34,721 --> 00:56:35,640
inverted commas.
Again,

1041
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,633
reality seems quite vital because there 
are so many modifications that are 

1042
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:44,290
altering what reality

1043
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,570
is or our perception of reality.
They're not altering relative,

1044
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,200
but they're altering our view of 
reality.

1045
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:52,500
We look at climate change as you said,
that's a crucial one.

1046
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:56,730
The problem with climate change is not 
the science.

1047
00:56:56,950 --> 00:57:00,400
The sciences in the science has done.
The problem is people.

1048
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,410
There are companies,
as you say,

1049
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,273
who do not want government into 
interrupting their business and telling 

1050
00:57:05,891 --> 00:57:06,724
them they have to reduce emissions and 
telling them they'll have to do 

1051
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:09,260
something that,
that,

1052
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,430
that threatens their profits.
So that's our problem.

1053
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,230
How do we do with the people?
That's the issue.

1054
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,153
It's not one more paper.
One more piece of evidence is actually 

1055
00:57:19,851 --> 00:57:20,684
going to convince anyone.
It's how do you deal with those sort of 

1056
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:25,560
political agents of change?
How do you hide?

1057
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,260
You Hide,
you monopolize that.

1058
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:29,270
How do you get people on site to do 
that?

1059
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:32,520
That wonder.
I wonder that too,

1060
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,120
but

1061
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,220
it doesn't seem to be with rational 
information because as you said,

1062
00:57:36,221 --> 00:57:37,270
the affirmation is,
yeah,

1063
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,600
it seems like it would need to be where 
power is,

1064
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:41,463
needs to alter as long as power.
The ability to influence remains with 

1065
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:48,683
people that are in profit rather than a 
large number of people as long as power 

1066
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:53,160
is not disseminating.

1067
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,060
So that will be careful with the talk of
power.

1068
00:57:56,061 --> 00:57:56,894
I mean,
I know people will often just sort of 

1069
00:57:58,101 --> 00:57:59,030
reached for the word,
but I,

1070
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,850
you know,
I remember Tony Benn always saying,

1071
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:04,340
uh,
if people have power,

1072
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,790
where did they get it?
Who gave it to them?

1073
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,430
How do they use it often and yeah,
and how they use it.

1074
00:58:10,431 --> 00:58:11,070
Right?
So,

1075
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:11,903
so,
so now you begin to see we've got to 

1076
00:58:12,831 --> 00:58:13,664
look at those stages.
You've got to look at power wasn't just 

1077
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:16,903
in a,
suddenly it was there and it was 

1078
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:21,170
exercised.
There had to be people who were,

1079
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,110
uh,
agents of,

1080
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:25,840
you know,
acquiring it and others who gave,

1081
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,550
gave in and seeded and said,
you can have this power and I'm,

1082
00:58:28,551 --> 00:58:29,384
I'm happy to grant it to you.
So that's where those individual 

1083
00:58:31,391 --> 00:58:32,224
decisions and those,
those judgments and those influences 

1084
00:58:34,991 --> 00:58:36,460
come in and they need to be looked at

1085
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,840
really carefully.
What fascinates me is that how much work

1086
00:58:39,841 --> 00:58:43,110
goes into concealing power.
We now sort of live in a time where it's

1087
00:58:43,111 --> 00:58:43,710
like,
well,

1088
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:45,800
where is this power now?
If,

1089
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,793
if,
if democracy at the level of the state 

1090
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:54,900
seems to be retained within quite 
limited borders.

1091
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:55,853
It's difficult to access transnational 
corporations that they know that we 

1092
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,373
purport to live by rationalism,
but a rational decision on discovering 

1093
00:59:05,161 --> 00:59:05,994
that climate change is real and can only
be effected if agriculture altars in 

1094
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:15,981
this way and if energy and power 
companies or in this way.

1095
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,690
As soon as you know that,
where is the resistance?

1096
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,910
And as soon as you could determine it,
other,

1097
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,093
he's here

1098
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,610
until you have purchase in that area.
It's irrelevance.

1099
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:26,453
No point in telling people,
put your bottles in this Bin and that 

1100
00:59:28,101 --> 00:59:28,934
bin.
But it's never a good telling people 

1101
00:59:30,831 --> 00:59:33,940
what to what to do.
They often don't mean think a thing of,

1102
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,770
I know more about his food and health 
issues,

1103
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:40,370
people telling them,
telling others what to eat,

1104
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,450
what not to eat,
what's good for you,

1105
00:59:41,451 --> 00:59:42,284
what's bad for you,
try to keep away from these particular 

1106
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,730
types of food and so on.
It never works.

1107
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,440
So what you've got to do is incentivize 
people in some other way.

1108
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:55,040
And with food it's always deliciousness.
Deliciousness will win out.

1109
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:56,143
It doesn't matter whether you tell 
people you know this is the healthy 

1110
00:59:57,741 --> 00:59:58,574
option and that's the unhealthy option.
They'll eat what they prefer and what 

1111
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:02,900
they find delicious.
But remember,

1112
01:00:02,901 --> 01:00:07,370
as you're trying to get messages across 
about how you can find delicious food,

1113
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:08,593
if it's Vegan or vegetarian,
I mean a lot of people becoming Vegan 

1114
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,670
and a lot of people resisting it because
they think,

1115
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:15,170
well,
the food won't be so delicious.

1116
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,540
So then we've got to make delicious 
Vegan food.

1117
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:19,250
If you're going to actually convert 
people to say,

1118
01:00:19,251 --> 01:00:21,650
you know,
you give up lots of,

1119
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:22,543
uh,
uh,

1120
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:25,190
uh,
heads of cattle,

1121
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:26,024
which are very expensive to be.
If we can make something so delicious 

1122
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:29,504
that you don't mind doing it,
that's the thing rather than the moral 

1123
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:33,380
argument.
Some people are very principled,

1124
01:00:33,381 --> 01:00:34,610
some people are very moral,
they'll do it,

1125
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:36,290
but we'll move them.
But remember,

1126
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:37,363
as you try to get people to eat better,
you try to get people to have better 

1127
01:00:40,161 --> 01:00:40,994
experiences.
You're up against multinational 

1128
01:00:43,521 --> 01:00:48,521
companies who are fantastically good,
who've got lots of research arms.

1129
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:52,430
They are to find out how to grab people.
If you look at mark,

1130
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:53,680
uh,
uh,

1131
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:57,470
just jacket norris extra cars,
shanker's book,

1132
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:58,663
the Dorito effect.
It's fantastic when you see just how 

1133
01:01:01,071 --> 01:01:01,904
much work goes into making a Dorito so 
much more delicious and desirable than 

1134
01:01:05,721 --> 01:01:08,150
any other food from the,
from the luke of the bag,

1135
01:01:08,151 --> 01:01:11,360
from the feel of the bag from the moment
you open it from the order that comes up

1136
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:13,820
from the slight spiciness on your tongue
and everything else.

1137
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:19,130
Multinational companies are doing a lot 
to get you to engage with that product,

1138
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:22,900
so it's going to be a very hard fight 
and the way you're gonna be able to sort

1139
01:01:22,901 --> 01:01:25,880
of wean people off things that are easy,
cheaper,

1140
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:27,173
a desirable and delicious to something 
that's healthy is not telling them it's 

1141
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:32,990
healthy.
You just got to make better stuff.

1142
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,960
You're going to make things that will 
actually move them at the gut level,

1143
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,013
at the,
at the smell and taste and the look and 

1144
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:40,580
feel,
or perhaps even beyond that gut level.

1145
01:01:40,581 --> 01:01:41,414
Because if as soon as system in that,
if I may say that the suggestion that 

1146
01:01:46,221 --> 01:01:50,180
people will only act,
at least in this example on the basis of

1147
01:01:50,181 --> 01:01:51,014
self interest of deliciousness,
the experience of deliciousness is 

1148
01:01:54,831 --> 01:01:55,664
there.
Not a moral equivalent to the delicious 

1149
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:01,310
as sense of beauty,
of connection,

1150
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,413
of gut shot and fraternity for sure,
but I wonder how we access the access 

1151
01:02:06,441 --> 01:02:07,274
that you've got to have time and 
patience and a certain amount of 

1152
01:02:09,561 --> 01:02:10,394
leisure.

1153
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:11,443
I mean the people who pay a lot of 
attention to but you have got rather 

1154
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:18,170
comfortable lives and an ability to sort
of take time out and stop and be mindful

1155
01:02:18,171 --> 01:02:21,090
and thoughtful about what they're 
interacting with and we,

1156
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:24,240
we didn't pick up on a point that you 
raised but we can come back to that just

1157
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:25,074
briefly on matters of taste.
So it used to be that the way that you 

1158
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:33,600
influence society was the idea of seeing
that's very bad taste to,

1159
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:34,813
you know,
to watch this television show or it's 

1160
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:38,410
very bad taste to,
to eat this thing or is there any,

1161
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,253
you know,
it's very naf to have pineapples stakes 

1162
01:02:41,311 --> 01:02:42,144
with,
you know,

1163
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:45,410
I'm a gammon stakes with a pineapple 
ring on it.

1164
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,040
The Cherry on the top,
you're very knife let's,

1165
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,120
let's aspire to something else.
But,

1166
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:54,210
but that was often those ideas of tastes
and what people wanted to identify with.

1167
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:59,300
We're often in a dictated by people who 
had a,

1168
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:03,250
a kind of elite position who were 
frightening others into saying,

1169
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:04,850
if you're not like,
as you know you're,

1170
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:09,870
you're not really making it.
But I do think what we eat,

1171
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,150
what we do with our leisure time,
what we,

1172
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:14,680
uh,
what we drink,

1173
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:15,663
how we,
how we spend any spare money that's all 

1174
01:03:20,321 --> 01:03:23,350
about who we want to identify with it 
is.

1175
01:03:23,351 --> 01:03:28,300
It is a kind of identity thing and,
and some very nice entity and otherness,

1176
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:29,163
identity and otherness.
Louise excluded in this group who's not 

1177
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:31,950
choosing what I do,

1178
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:33,310
who's making an apple.

1179
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:35,391
Yeah.
You know,

1180
01:03:35,391 --> 01:03:37,810
one of us prawn cocktail really,
you know,

1181
01:03:37,811 --> 01:03:41,380
so that,
that sense of wanting to identify.

1182
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,693
It's very powerful and it,
and it does come through food and 

1183
01:03:44,531 --> 01:03:46,510
clothing and music and all the rest of 
it.

1184
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:47,723
And politically there's a,
there's an angle here because once 

1185
01:03:50,671 --> 01:03:51,504
you've decided who you identify with,
when decisions come along that you 

1186
01:03:55,681 --> 01:03:58,290
haven't thought through,
it's much easier to say,

1187
01:03:58,291 --> 01:03:58,771
well,
who did it?

1188
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:01,140
My,
what did the group identify with?

1189
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:02,010
Tend to say,
oh,

1190
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:02,844
I'll go with that.
And you're seeing more and more of that 

1191
01:04:04,981 --> 01:04:05,814
in social media.
And I the fact that having already 

1192
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:11,520
decided who you belong to,
if there's an issue and you haven't made

1193
01:04:11,521 --> 01:04:16,350
up your mind if your group,
if your people decide one way,

1194
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:18,790
it's very easy to tag yourself on the 
back of that,

1195
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:21,730
but no,
we are starting to get islands or people

1196
01:04:21,731 --> 01:04:24,940
separated from each other because you're
talking to the people who are.

1197
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:25,953
You're identifying with a not 
necessarily engaging with and listening 

1198
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:29,314
to the others,
and of course will make better 

1199
01:04:30,401 --> 01:04:31,234
decisions.
Although it's uncomfortable if we have 

1200
01:04:33,221 --> 01:04:35,050
more diversity of opinion,
we've got more.

1201
01:04:35,051 --> 01:04:36,430
People are kind of challenging.

1202
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,900
It's almost like we don't have geo 
tribes.

1203
01:04:39,901 --> 01:04:44,901
Now we have an atomized online opinion 
groups to return to a point about beauty

1204
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:47,334
there for a moment,
if you think of it from an artistic 

1205
01:04:49,891 --> 01:04:53,430
perspective,
specifically the keats quote,

1206
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,050
beauty is truth.
Truth is beauty.

1207
01:04:55,051 --> 01:05:00,051
That beauty is value is only in that it 
is an Avatar of goodness rightness.

1208
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,300
So I don't mean,
but in terms of other,

1209
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,233
of course I do.
And in terms of aesthetics and perhaps 

1210
01:05:07,651 --> 01:05:08,484
Oscar Wilde is a good vehicle for this,
can you think of sort of like wild 

1211
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,610
initially superficial seeming sense of 
aesthetics?

1212
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:15,903
Uh,
on examination it seems that Wilde was 

1213
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:23,050
particularly interested in truth,
purity,

1214
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,290
innocence,
like,

1215
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,970
so some charming ideas around 
Catholicism in these,

1216
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:30,490
right in about children.
So like,

1217
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,260
you know,
again,

1218
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:33,363
when we talk about the senses,
it seems that there are ways of dialing 

1219
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:38,430
up,
dialing down in the bowl of yogurt,

1220
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:40,320
you know,
optical illusions that we,

1221
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:43,200
even when you see them in a tabloid 
newspaper sort of dazzle you.

1222
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,043
When I was a kid,
there were these things that seemed 

1223
01:05:44,831 --> 01:05:47,680
three d when you're standing,
it's like a dinosaur was coming out.

1224
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:48,693
And like,
I'm always fascinated by that because 

1225
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:50,463
there's something of,
I guess what Freud would call the 

1226
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:52,534
uncanny.
There've been moments I've had with 

1227
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:56,650
psychedelics when I think reality is not
what I think it is.

1228
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:01,320
And this is just but one bandwidth and 
talk for a moment of,

1229
01:06:01,321 --> 01:06:01,910
uh,
you know,

1230
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:02,830
the,
the,

1231
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:03,873
of course,
we live within a limited spectrum of 

1232
01:06:05,141 --> 01:06:05,974
color.
We live within a limited range of sound 

1233
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:10,300
vibration.
Is it a,

1234
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,110
is it pointless to speculate,
but we.

1235
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,003
There are realms of senses for which we 
do not have the instruments that we're 

1236
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:20,973
surrounded by waves and all or his 
lights and fields for things for which 

1237
01:06:27,071 --> 01:06:30,460
we don't even have the language because 
we don't have the instruments to receive

1238
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:30,740
them.

1239
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,120
Well,
we could think that,

1240
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:33,010
but I actually,
I'm,

1241
01:06:33,011 --> 01:06:35,240
I'm,
I'm more intrigued by the idea that,

1242
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:36,103
that we're already in receipt of so many
sensory inputs that we don't pay 

1243
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:43,160
attention to it we don't know about,
but we're influenced by them.

1244
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,353
The fact that we are not aware of them 
doesn't mean they're not shaping our 

1245
01:06:47,911 --> 01:06:50,220
experience conditioning what we're 
about,

1246
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:52,980
but here's another thing that to go back
to beauty,

1247
01:06:52,981 --> 01:06:56,460
which I think links with the political 
in a way that might interest you.

1248
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:02,950
We all operate a kind of everyday 
aesthetics.

1249
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,770
We choose which Mug to have in which 
ball.

1250
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,580
When we're having our breakfast,
we like things arranged a certain way.

1251
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:14,850
We will make little efforts to make our 
surroundings feel more pleasing,

1252
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:17,450
happier,
and it's,

1253
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:18,643
I think,
a terrible sign of the poverty of the 

1254
01:07:20,331 --> 01:07:24,350
spirit when people are really crushed 
when they no longer even do that.

1255
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:25,643
So there was a sociologist in Glasgow in
the seventies who went and lived in the 

1256
01:07:30,771 --> 01:07:31,604
Gorbals uh,
and she had to kind of manufacture an 

1257
01:07:34,521 --> 01:07:36,710
accent so people didn't treat her as an 
outsider.

1258
01:07:36,711 --> 01:07:38,330
She wanted to do anthropology,
you know,

1259
01:07:38,331 --> 01:07:40,480
I'll be among the people.
Yeah.

1260
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:41,510
And I'm going to

1261
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:45,770
exactly.

1262
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:46,603
Okay.
So she was able to sort of see roughly 

1263
01:07:48,291 --> 01:07:49,940
fake,
but like an anthropologist,

1264
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:54,110
I'm going to go and brilliant and she.
But she said it always struck me.

1265
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:54,944
She said the people I was living amongst
who were most deprived didn't even make 

1266
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:04,350
any effort to make their immediate 
surroundings prettier or pleasant.

1267
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:05,483
Other people,
it put a painter Cota and on the door 

1268
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,650
they'd have a plant part outside the 
window.

1269
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,633
There are ways in which they just wanted
to make their environment a little 

1270
01:08:13,471 --> 01:08:14,304
nicer.
And then you saw people who couldn't 

1271
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,630
even do that.
They were so broken.

1272
01:08:17,631 --> 01:08:18,464
They were so crushed.
They were so beaten down that even that 

1273
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:22,064
attempt just to make your immediate 
surroundings feel more pleasing had 

1274
01:08:25,071 --> 01:08:25,904
gone,
so I think that urge to have a little 

1275
01:08:27,981 --> 01:08:31,340
bit of everyday aesthetics to make our 
surroundings nicer,

1276
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:34,940
to make a choice,
a choice about what,

1277
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:36,060
what,
what spoon.

1278
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,000
We'll use what Mug we'll use,
what you know,

1279
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:40,280
how will we just want things to look on 
the table.

1280
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:42,043
That's very basic about being okay about
wellbeing and about humanity and when 

1281
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:48,970
that goes,
we're really in trouble in a few things.

1282
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:49,913
I'd like to pick up like a technique for
people in addiction for measuring your 

1283
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:58,160
wellness and sort of a personal wellness
index where you can sort of ask yourself

1284
01:08:58,161 --> 01:08:58,994
a series of questions and give yourself 
a one to 10 evaluation on how clean is 

1285
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:06,440
your car at the moment.
How well is your diet?

1286
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,360
How often are you arguing with your 
spouse?

1287
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:10,550
These sort of tiny.
When I think myself,

1288
01:09:10,551 --> 01:09:14,860
there've been times in my life where I 
would almost eat the cereal out of box.

1289
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:19,130
Typically tippecanoe chew now into Udl 
because I've got.

1290
01:09:19,131 --> 01:09:21,370
I've got no demonstration of 
selflessness,

1291
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,220
no idea of the beauty of the self,
you know,

1292
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,100
the idea of the beauty of the world.

1293
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:25,910
Yeah.
There's,

1294
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:26,743
those values have totally broken down.
And also I'm Grayson Perry and he's 

1295
01:09:31,311 --> 01:09:34,700
brilliant documentaries about taste and 
class where he sort of,

1296
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,450
what he,
uh,

1297
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,313
like he's,
I suppose he's thesis was that like are 

1298
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,753
the higher up the class,
the less demonstrative class structure 

1299
01:09:44,121 --> 01:09:48,740
that less demonstrative taste was in 
working class culture,

1300
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:52,130
big Larry vehicles with staff on them,
jewelry,

1301
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:53,143
tatters.
And then when you get into the upper 

1302
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:55,424
class,
upper class is sort of everything 

1303
01:09:56,751 --> 01:09:58,610
understated no labels in the middle 
class.

1304
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,270
It was a wonderful way of tracking class
when,

1305
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:07,380
how classes exemplified and further on,
tasty sort of showed like there's a clip

1306
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:12,730
of warm metal work in men's club,
sort of at the front with some kind of a

1307
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:13,673
crooner guy and she was all drunk and 
having a wonderful emotional experience 

1308
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:18,380
and crying.
And he said like,

1309
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:21,470
but why do we think of that as somehow 
sort of vulgar?

1310
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:24,290
Whereas a woman generally weeping in a 
box at lover him,

1311
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,110
we think of the height of 
sophistication,

1312
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:31,400
who is deciding what is beautiful,
who is deciding what is good tastes.

1313
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,230
Very often it's about distance,
isn't it?

1314
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:37,880
A lot of people when they consider the 
high arts at the fine arts,

1315
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:38,321
they,
they,

1316
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:40,880
they,
they want to embrace it,

1317
01:10:40,881 --> 01:10:42,710
but they want a kind of distance from 
it.

1318
01:10:42,711 --> 01:10:45,170
So I think our prayers like that.
It's so staged.

1319
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:49,430
It's so artificial that you know you can
exercise those emotions,

1320
01:10:49,431 --> 01:10:50,264
but only because it's clearly not 
reality and it's a little bit further 

1321
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:55,730
away.
Whereas the crooner in the club,

1322
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:59,180
she's getting very near to kind of 
affecting you.

1323
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,870
This is her real life.
It's probably some of the sadness in her

1324
01:11:02,871 --> 01:11:03,704
life that you're immediately hearing and
that way in which some people like art 

1325
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:10,100
to be a safe space to exercise their 
emotions.

1326
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,750
As long as there's a bit distant from 
them,

1327
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:12,973
it's not going to.
It's not going to be bad to have 

1328
01:11:14,821 --> 01:11:15,654
tragedy.
It's not going to be bad to have 

1329
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:17,304
something side.
It's not going to be bad to have 

1330
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:22,950
something that's kind of powerful.
That's also as a skirt.

1331
01:11:22,951 --> 01:11:25,620
I think I can say that a 
characteristically English thing to want

1332
01:11:25,621 --> 01:11:27,480
to do a certain level of society.
Yeah,

1333
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,353
we,
we're living,

1334
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,600
we're aloof.
You don't want your feelings and there.

1335
01:11:30,601 --> 01:11:31,434
I mean,
Scott's very funny because they imagine 

1336
01:11:32,491 --> 01:11:34,740
they're full of reason,
but they're actually full of passion and

1337
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:35,460
you know,
they get,

1338
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:39,630
they get very wound up and worked up so 
they feel the strain between those two.

1339
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,270
But I think,
you know,

1340
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:46,230
the English often volume,
the lack of overt expression of emotions

1341
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:49,520
and yet we'll still go to an opera and 
weep in a,

1342
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,920
as long as it's in a safe space,
as long as it's not,

1343
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:56,460
you're not going to have to get up and 
talk to your neighbor immediately beside

1344
01:11:56,461 --> 01:11:58,500
you when you were feeling a little raw 
and emotional.

1345
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,633
So I think that's right.
And I think also that expression of 

1346
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:07,110
exercising your taste again,
um,

1347
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:12,510
people with terminal illnesses who've 
got limited periods of time,

1348
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:13,583
they often say they know,
pay attention to their everyday 

1349
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:19,980
experience and to the pattern of it.
The texture of it and a new way,

1350
01:12:19,981 --> 01:12:20,814
you know,
they instead of just putting the milk 

1351
01:12:22,051 --> 01:12:24,090
bottle on the table,
they'll put it into a jug.

1352
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,730
They'll want to sort of pour it on the 
on the cereal.

1353
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:28,920
Why make that effort?
You might say,

1354
01:12:28,921 --> 01:12:29,754
you know,
you only have to wash out the drug 

1355
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:34,040
because it makes that particular moment 
nicer.

1356
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:36,440
Brighter.
I'm looking after myself.

1357
01:12:36,441 --> 01:12:37,274
I'm taking care of each of these moments
because they're precious and if we had 

1358
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:41,863
endless amount of time to live,
nothing will be precious because we 

1359
01:12:44,541 --> 01:12:47,570
could always do it later.
We can always do it at some other moment

1360
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:48,763
and I think it's being in the moment,
being aware of how you make the 

1361
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:53,840
immediate environment and the 
environment of others better.

1362
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:55,930
That's the thing that we want to 
concentrate on.

1363
01:12:55,931 --> 01:12:56,700
That's the thing that makes me feel 
good.

1364
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,290
Live.
Yes.

1365
01:12:58,380 --> 01:12:59,213
To create somehow a kind of art 
throughout life to be reverential 

1366
01:13:05,401 --> 01:13:06,234
towards beauty,
our our own beauty in the beauty of 

1367
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:13,971
others and that the senses can be 
instruments for measuring beauty.

1368
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,530
Not Tools,
tools,

1369
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:21,780
but ways in which we remediate the 
beauty in ourselves and others.

1370
01:13:21,781 --> 01:13:24,810
And actually are really literally in 
touch with it.

1371
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:25,740
Yeah,
I think so.

1372
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:26,703
Literally in touch.
This is where the external world is 

1373
01:13:28,151 --> 01:13:31,990
entering our lives through these fields,
through the portals.

1374
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,570
This is where we access.
That's very beautiful.

1375
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,670
Just darkness and possibly a lighter 
note though,

1376
01:13:36,671 --> 01:13:39,820
it may not be your like a connoisseur of
wine.

1377
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:41,760
You must be bloody good at that.
Ah,

1378
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:42,803
God,
I always terrified of this question 

1379
01:13:44,401 --> 01:13:45,234
because the one thing that people who 
are pretty good tasters and pretty 

1380
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:50,004
knowledge about wine as,
they never want to say that they're 

1381
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,670
experts because they're also very easily
fooled.

1382
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,780
It's from Tesco because it's two 99.
Oh,

1383
01:13:57,781 --> 01:14:01,260
I found this delicious tasting a belief 
in a barrel.

1384
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:04,200
That's.
I remember.

1385
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,900
Here's a nice story about,
about wine experts that I think is,

1386
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,690
is better.
Uh,

1387
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:12,470
I talked to German who was a uh,
uh,

1388
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:14,200
the world,
Somalia.

1389
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:17,440
He won the championship world some lea.
So there he is looking after people in a

1390
01:14:17,441 --> 01:14:18,274
restaurant with wines and he said,
what do you think you need to be a good 

1391
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:22,630
Somalia?
He said,

1392
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:23,464
you probably imagined someone who can 
taste any wine and tell you immediately 

1393
01:14:26,231 --> 01:14:30,760
where it came from and who's venyard and
what year or you think you're someone.

1394
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,520
It's someone who will tell you,
Oh,

1395
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:34,900
you know,
Sarah Motto,

1396
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:36,580
if this is what you're reading,
this is what you should drink.

1397
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,800
He said,
what you need is humility.

1398
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,560
You need modesty and humility.
He said,

1399
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:46,561
because your job is to try to find out 
what the customer likes and wants and to

1400
01:14:47,201 --> 01:14:50,680
help them to find something that's right
for them and good for them.

1401
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:51,880
And he said,
and also,

1402
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:54,400
you know,
every day of the week I'll have to blind

1403
01:14:54,401 --> 01:14:57,190
taste and I will get a wine wrong.
You know,

1404
01:14:57,191 --> 01:14:59,500
it will make me humble again.
Don't make me no.

1405
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:02,590
I still don't understand everything 
about this world of wine.

1406
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:06,610
And he talked about having a client who 
came in to the restaurant,

1407
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:12,070
guy knew nothing about wine.
Your does a a steak dish.

1408
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:12,993
And he picks up the wine list and he 
goes through it and he finds a dessert 

1409
01:15:16,991 --> 01:15:18,650
wine,
Chateau de cam,

1410
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,920
perhaps one of the world's most 
expensive,

1411
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:22,180
most beautiful wines.
But it's a,

1412
01:15:22,181 --> 01:15:25,030
it's a sweet dessert wine and,
and he,

1413
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,980
he,
he either knows the name or he's looking

1414
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,210
for an expensive wine,
so he says,

1415
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:31,810
I'll have this,
and the smelly lea didn't say,

1416
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:32,650
Oh sir,
no,

1417
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:34,450
you don't have a dessert wine with the 
state.

1418
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:35,283
You want something from the Rhone or 
from Bordeaux and let me find it for 

1419
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:38,613
instead he came,
he went to the sheriff and he came back 

1420
01:15:41,381 --> 01:15:45,000
and he said to the guy,
since you're having the Chateau de cam,

1421
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:48,220
the chef thought that you might want it 
with a for grass source.

1422
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:52,180
So they had changed the food to make 
something more acceptable,

1423
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:55,550
more suitable to go with the wine he had
ordered and he said,

1424
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:56,384
and that guy now trusts me and he's 
learning more and he's becoming quite 

1425
01:16:00,341 --> 01:16:01,174
enthusiastic and you know,
he lost my advice and I think that's a 

1426
01:16:04,391 --> 01:16:06,610
lovely story.
Didn't humiliate him.

1427
01:16:06,611 --> 01:16:09,850
He didn't show off.
We didn't sort of impose his knowledge.

1428
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,810
He find out what this guy wanted and 
what it was about.

1429
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:19,090
And then showed him gradually found ways
to show how do you match food and wines.

1430
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:22,060
And that's what I always want to do,
if I'm,

1431
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,730
if I'm trying to get people interested 
in wine,

1432
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:30,160
I do not want to do that thing that so 
often we see where someone's standing at

1433
01:16:30,161 --> 01:16:31,930
the front of the room and they're 
saying,

1434
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:34,030
well,
this is a particularly tight knit,

1435
01:16:34,031 --> 01:16:35,350
Clara it from the left bank.

1436
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:36,240
I think your show,
it's,

1437
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,113
it's,
uh,

1438
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:39,670
I think you'll find it's showing a 
little bit of maturation,

1439
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:40,540
you know,
very fantastic.

1440
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,540
And everybody in the room thinks I don't
know what he's talking about.

1441
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:46,090
I don't get that and I'll never get 
that.

1442
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,930
And they feel left out.
So instead I think what I always want to

1443
01:16:49,931 --> 01:16:54,670
do is give people a chance to discover 
something about themselves while they're

1444
01:16:54,671 --> 01:16:58,480
having a wine.
So the hardest thing people do is,

1445
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:01,780
is getting a single glass and you see 
how is it?

1446
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,520
And they say,
oh,

1447
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:04,750
I don't know.
I like it,

1448
01:17:04,751 --> 01:17:06,640
I don't like it.
But you see,

1449
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,500
can you say anymore?
No.

1450
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:11,240
But now if you give people two glasses 
of wine,

1451
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,270
two glasses of different lines,
you said try them both.

1452
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:17,180
Which do you prefer?
I prefer the one on the right.

1453
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,940
Is it different from the one that left?

1454
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:20,301
Yeah.
Hi.

1455
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:20,911
Different.
Oh,

1456
01:17:20,911 --> 01:17:21,744
well.
It's slightly more juicy or fruity or 

1457
01:17:23,391 --> 01:17:25,850
it's slightly more sour or the one is 
light sour inside.

1458
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:27,223
Now they start comparing and now they're
beginning to understand something about 

1459
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:31,874
what's going on in the wine and also 
something about what's going on in them 

1460
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:38,000
and I love that because then when they 
learn about it,

1461
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:40,430
they'll go and pass it onto someone 
else.

1462
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:42,980
They'll get someone else to practice and
to try this and you say,

1463
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:45,950
with our red wine,
what do you think of it?

1464
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,090
Or describe it.
They'll say,

1465
01:17:47,091 --> 01:17:48,830
well,
it's fruity and you can say,

1466
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:49,664
okay,
red fruits are black fruits and that's 

1467
01:17:52,521 --> 01:17:54,140
kind of an easy thing for people to 
think,

1468
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:57,140
is it more blackberry black currant or 
is it strawberry raspberry?

1469
01:17:57,141 --> 01:18:02,000
They can do that and now you just give 
them choices and you get them to explore

1470
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:02,834
and either exploring not just the wine.
They're exploring their response and 

1471
01:18:05,091 --> 01:18:05,924
reaction to it and you find out what 
they like and what they don't like and 

1472
01:18:08,991 --> 01:18:10,850
now they can choose better than they 
can,

1473
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:12,470
you know,
they can now take an interest,

1474
01:18:12,471 --> 01:18:14,420
they can go on and exploring for 
themselves.

1475
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:16,000
And that's what I want to do.
I want,

1476
01:18:16,001 --> 01:18:17,540
I want to give people the means to do 
that

1477
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,750
quite early in that I realized that I'm 
an alcoholic.

1478
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:25,990
No one do that to take,
to take black fruit.

1479
01:18:28,131 --> 01:18:29,630
Red Fruit actually.
Typically,

1480
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:32,690
what are you doing?
That's fantastic.

1481
01:18:32,691 --> 01:18:33,960
I think that was a,
um,

1482
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:34,863
a beautiful analogy for the world of 
knowledge in general that we have to 

1483
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:45,070
invite people to have a degree of 
authority in their experience of sensual

1484
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:48,110
world and the philosophical world.
And again,

1485
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,180
only the things that there are words 
for,

1486
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:51,223
uh,
being described when you were talking 

1487
01:18:52,131 --> 01:18:52,964
about one there.
My wife wrote this brilliant book when 

1488
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:59,620
we're before our daughter was born and 
they in this book,

1489
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,513
it was really excellent skill.
It said it gave you the vocabulary for 

1490
01:19:04,641 --> 01:19:08,100
describing the types of sensation you 
would go through him.

1491
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,100
Birth.
Is it burning?

1492
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:14,870
Is it stretching is in actually in sort 
of when it broke down the pain,

1493
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:15,883
it took away works that were very 
generic and also catastrophic and 

1494
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:24,821
provided you with a means to articulate 
what your experience is,

1495
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,073
you that moment,
and I think my wife certainly said it 

1496
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:31,460
removed much of the fear around that

1497
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:34,730
probably became a connoisseur of her own
pain.

1498
01:19:34,731 --> 01:19:36,830
She was interested in it.
What was it like?

1499
01:19:36,831 --> 01:19:38,450
Was it stinging?
Was at burning?

1500
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:40,660
Was it stretching?
Is it pulling in Sun and,

1501
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:41,593
and the more she's attending and 
thinking about the particular texture 

1502
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:48,260
the last year,
just feeling the raw yuck of pain,

1503
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:52,370
the more you're able to cope and pain 
management is often about that.

1504
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,590
Getting people to actually pay attention
to the,

1505
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,040
you know,
the real we've and fabric and texture.

1506
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,113
Do you think that neurologically that's 
because moving you to a different part 

1507
01:19:59,841 --> 01:20:02,990
of your consciousness and possibly 
remove brain and uh,

1508
01:20:02,991 --> 01:20:04,520
and limiting distractions?
Yeah,

1509
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:05,403
it is,
but it's better to do that than just 

1510
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,640
sedate you.
Have you kind of comatose.

1511
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:09,261
I mean,
I,

1512
01:20:09,261 --> 01:20:11,580
I really think pain management is 
difficult but,

1513
01:20:11,581 --> 01:20:12,414
but more attention rather than less.
And more discrimination rather than 

1514
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:17,460
less.
You'll be able to manage it.

1515
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:18,583
Yes.
Oh,

1516
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:20,130
well,
Professor Barry Smith.

1517
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:20,964
Thank you so much.
That was a really interesting and quite 

1518
01:20:22,771 --> 01:20:24,300
intense journey.
I thought.

1519
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,590
Wide ranging.
It was a pleasure.

1520
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:26,920
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1521
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:28,140
Thank you for your time.
It's brilliant.

1522
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,840
That show was sponsored by my book 
recovery,

1523
01:20:30,841 --> 01:20:35,841
which is available now on Amazon.
Six quid on a bargain price while way to

1524
01:20:35,881 --> 01:20:37,890
get your head straight in January.
Look at the world.

1525
01:20:37,891 --> 01:20:40,590
Everyone's addicted to their phones.
Everyone's addicted to everything.

1526
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:44,700
The world is falling apart.
What is the solution I am finally.

1527
01:20:44,701 --> 01:20:47,640

1529
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,560
I can't justify it,
but hopefully the quality of the product

1530
01:20:55,561 --> 01:20:57,210
speaks for itself,
but even if it doesn't,

1531
01:20:57,211 --> 01:20:59,130
why don't you speak.
Thanks guys.

1532

Hope you enjoyed the show.
Bye.
