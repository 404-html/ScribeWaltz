00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,790
Thank you for downloading under the skin

00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,180
Well,
I mean I prefer genuine ones,

9
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,014
but we will take fake ones.
It helps us to glean power and may help 

10
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:25,464
us to at some point get a sponsor,
but for now under the skin with Russell

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,560
Russell brand,
rebirth tour under the skin.

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,630
Have a look,
but never smelled it.

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,790
Today's guest is Adam Curtis do now.
Adam Curtis.

23
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,620
Have you seen hypernormalization his new
film?

24
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,560
Did you watch that thing better leg?
Did you see the power of nightmares?

25
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,570
Did you see century of the self,
the Mayfair set?

26
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:37,710
I've seen all them things and that is 
why a much more clever than what you are

27
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,903
in this episode of under the skin.
I talked to Adam about what all manner 

28
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,070
of things actually,
but he's a brilliant political mind.

29
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,670
If you want to understand what's going 
on in the boat,

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,580
trump,
brexit,

31
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,563
terrorism,
the way that media news narratives or 

32
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,850
contrived conspiracy theories,
what their value,

33
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:57,000
then you could do a lot worse than to 
watch Adam courtesies films.

34
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:57,834
I've become friends with him actually,
and I find them to be an absolute 

35
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:01,530
darling man.
Do you know?

36
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:02,364
You may not know that he was actually 
made films for that life and that if 

37
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:07,920
you're a person that's about my age who 
were born in the seventies or eighties,

38
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:08,730
you meant protocol.

39
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,450
That's life of restaurants and where she
would get sort of like,

40
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:13,590
you know,
good news type stories like a dog.

41
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,424
Don't start talking.
The same sausage is sort of pap 

42
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,410
mindlessness,
what Adam coast made that,

43
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:24,180
but he went on to be one of the great 
narrators of our complex media age.

44
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:26,700
If you're an American listener and not 
familiar of Adam's work,

45
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,730
you want to get familiar with it right 
now by checking out his blog.

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,390
But,
uh,

47
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,223
he's a fantastic storyteller on great 
sort of cultural events such as a 

48
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,453
leaner,
like defining events such as nine slash 

49
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:39,174
11,
the grip of the Berlin Wall coming down 

50
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:42,540
and it gives us an interesting 
perspective there.

51
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,850
Check out his stuff.
Check out this interview,

52
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:47,490
remember to go and give me a nice 
positive review.

53
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,140
You're listened to Russell brand under 
the skin.

54
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,313
I've been giving you your intro the 
whole time that you've been shambling 

55
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:55,924
through the corridor.
It's like a gray ghost laundry like 

56
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:00,880
Jacob Marley,

57
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,123
with the chains being your own archive,
saying most wonderful things about 

58
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:08,380
hypernormalization.
What do you mean that we're living in an

59
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:13,180
unreal world as some sort of simulate?
What do you mean by it?

60
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:15,280
What is the point of this film?
Hypernormalization.

61
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,330
Tell us what you mean.

62
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,430
What I remember happening,
I mean it's done.

63
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,883
What I meant by hypernormalisation is 
that it got the term comes from a guy 

64
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,533
rather than just guy who write about 
what it was like to live in the Soviet 

65
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,263
Union.
That late in the middle of the 19 eight 

66
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:35,454
is where the Soviet Union was collapsing
because it wasn't really any protest at 

67
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:40,074
the time,
but what he pointed out he is that 

68
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,090
everyone knew that everything was not 
right.

69
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,660
They knew that those in control had no 
control.

70
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,940
They knew that those running the 
economy,

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,553
we're not in control,
that everything was corrupt and often 

72
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:57,660
completely faked because the leaders 
were pretending they were in control.

73
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,540
Everybody knew this and the leaders knew
that.

74
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:04,530
Everybody knew this,
but nobody did anything about it because

75
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,423
there was nothing else.
It was normal and he coined the phrase 

76
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:13,290
hypernormalization to describe this,
but somehow you knew that everything was

77
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,710
a bit odd and a bit unreal and often 
fake,

78
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,940
but because there was no other picture 
of the world and you were so within this

79
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:21,774
system,
you accepted it as normal and just went 

80
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,330
on and what I'm trying to argue in this 
room is not in any way.

81
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,630
We're like the Soviet Union were a very 
different society,

82
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,913
but what we do share with that time is a
sense among a lot of people that things 

83
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:37,104
are a bit odd,
an unreal and sometimes fake and those 

84
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:45,270
in charge know that they're not in 
charge and they know that.

85
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:49,080
We know they're not in charge of things,
that everything is a bit chaotic,

86
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,300
uncertain.
We distrust everyone in charge.

87
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,283
We also know those in charge allow a 
great deal of corruption to carry on 

88
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,443
without doing much about it.
We know that they're not in control of 

89
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:01,770
their economy and they know we're not in
control.

90
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,663
They know that.
We know they're not in control of the 

91
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:07,300
economy and in that's,
but at the same time we.

92
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,393
We are so much a part of that system 
that we don't have any vision of an 

93
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,730
alternative,
and I include by that the left,

94
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,850
the people who argue that they do want 
to change things,

95
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,340
they don't have a vision of an 
alternative.

96
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,490
So we accepted as normal.
So when you,

97
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,760
when you see another newspaper article 
coming out saying,

98
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,170
Oh look,
they were actually supplying arms to the

99
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:34,540
Yemen to allow the Saudis to bomb Yemen.
We go,

100
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,750
yeah,
well we sort of expect.

101
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:37,584
Yeah man,

102
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,483
I know what you mean because I did hear 
that we were supplying arms to the 

103
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:47,550
Saudis to bomb Yemen.
They have a day on a four.

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,190
Oh yes.
That's it.

105
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,693
A very good example.
The reaction is the most interesting 

106
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:56,260
thing of our time.
We sort of expected the,

107
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,363
the,
the arms industry and the government in 

108
00:05:58,821 --> 00:05:59,654
this country would allegedly allow arms 
to be supplied to this war that we know 

109
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:08,120
is causing horrific civilian deaths and 
we have no way of controlling it.

110
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,870
We know that and we just accepted it's 
normal,

111
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,700
but actually it's wrong,
isn't it?

112
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,450
But we know that however much we feel it
might be wrong,

113
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,040
nothing's going to change.

114
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,980
Is it a condition of five?
Normalization then Adam impotence.

115
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,630
It is impotence in the face of a chaotic
world.

116
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,040
We think that was in charge.
I have no control over,

117
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,130
but we accept it.
So it's not just impotent,

118
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,160
it's we're passive and we accepted.
So in a way we are as complicit in it as

119
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:39,324
our leaders,
but but we do that because no one has 

120
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,590
gives us any alternative.
We accept it as just normal.

121
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,050
When the thing,
when you have an alternative,

122
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:52,320
you can see suddenly something.
It puts it in perspective.

123
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,390
You've got an alternative,
you see,

124
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,110
you see things truly for what they are,
and you can pull back,

125
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:57,944
detach and go,
I don't like that this is better or you 

126
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:02,490
don't.
At the moment there isn't an.

127
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:03,324
I think one of the great faults lies 
with the left who say they do one 

128
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,253
change.
I mean the real changing moment is 

129
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:09,834
coming from a strange,
weird mixture of right wing nationalism 

130
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:14,820
and racism as far as I can see.
Yes,

131
00:07:14,821 --> 00:07:17,460
but they're failing to offer any 
alternative.

132
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:18,963
Yes.
Alternative visions is that what you're 

133
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:20,734
saying is that the alternative visions 
are always going to come from the 

134
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,913
periphery or from the subculture and 
that the left is unable to provide a 

135
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,590
legitimate and genuine alternative.
There are in fact involved in it

136
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,753
rhetorical exchange.
Now it feels more and more like 

137
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,780
rhetoric.
I mean,

138
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:37,614
I.
I point out in the film how strange it 

139
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:39,654
is that in the recent years,
all the attempts to change the world 

140
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:44,574
radically,
which had a great deal of force behind 

141
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:47,700
them.
The occupy movement,

142
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,150
the Arab spring and tire square in 
particular in Egypt,

143
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,450
seretse in Europe,
all of stalled.

144
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,373
They had great power behind them.
They had great goodwill behind them and 

145
00:07:58,471 --> 00:07:59,304
they stalled and I argue in the film,
it's because they confuse process with 

146
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:06,270
content that they did.
They they assembled.

147
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,133
They were very powerful.
They had a great slogan behind them in 

148
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:09,484
the occupy movement,
great deal of emotional goodwill from 

149
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:12,294
people who would not normally support 
revolutionary movements and they just 

150
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:15,834
stopped.

151
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,920
So what I said that sounds.
There's two things.

152
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:18,950
One,
it tells us the,

153
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:19,301
the,
the,

154
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:23,950
the bleak observation one can make is 
that there is no coherent,

155
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,813
clear alternative vision,
but the other thing is that there is a 

156
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:28,384
desire for change.
That's the positive thing that we can 

157
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,624
draw from that,
that when all put their mouse or 

158
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:38,440
whatever rises up in those cases from,
I suppose I'm more close to there,

159
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:39,274
to the left,
if not a traditional leftist movement 

160
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:42,580
because it's embracing technology and 
sort of populism.

161
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:45,520
In some ways it seems novel if not 
entirely new.

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,360
Uh,
there,

163
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,760
there is a genuine appetite for it.
Yes.

164
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,020
What do you imagine Adam is the,
what,

165
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:55,680
what is the problem that,
what I mean in a way,

166
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:55,980
why

167
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,250
would we expect if the world is changing
as radically as it is,

168
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,203
if it's a result of technology and sort 
of a racing or rapidly advancing 

169
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,923
economic realities that are conventional
and traditional left would be the 

170
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:11,700
answer.
Why would we imagine that?

171
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:12,720
I mean,
in a sense,

172
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,643
these are centuries old ideas that have 
not been modified it because we're no 

173
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:21,730
longer living in a version of 20th 
century capitalism are we.

174
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:26,731
So why would like so why would a 20th 
century socialism be a response to it?

175
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,343
In a way,
I argue in the film where I try and 

176
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:33,240
demonstrate journalistically in the film
that we know we're not living in the old

177
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,460
idea of capitalism than we used to think
about.

178
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:40,170
What we've shifted into is a a new 
system of power,

179
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,290
which I see as being fundamentally 
managerial.

180
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,260
It's the reverse new bureaucracies 
around us,

181
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,183
including things on the Internet,
but also in finance and in and in 

182
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:53,440
management systems in all the closest 
that many people work in.

183
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,700
The aim is to essentially keep the world
staple.

184
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,250
I mean that's what finance is desperate 
to do it.

185
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,200
It's always wanting to monitor the 
world.

186
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,230
Looking for risk.
Risk is a fascinating word.

187
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,303
I,
I.

188
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,200
This is Oregon.
I did a word search on Lexisnexis,

189
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,390
which is the cuttings filed of all 
newspapers up until about 1988,

190
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,920
1990.
The word risk hardly features in German,

191
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:18,803
so obviously there and then suddenly in 
the nineties it rises up and it's this 

192
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,920
what drives modern managerial 
capitalism.

193
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:30,921
If you can give it a word like that is 
this desire to avoid instability,

194
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,030
to analyze the past,
look for patterns that are happening now

195
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:39,200
that looked like dangers in the past and
then adjust that.

196
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,600
There's always a sort of a right thing 
to be,

197
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,633
and I.
I see it in our own personalities as 

198
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,134
well.
There's always a right way to be 

199
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:47,820
psychologically.

200
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,010
There's always a right body mass index 
to have.

201
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,730
There is always the right stable thing 
to be understand.

202
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:55,940
Now I'm going to insert for like first 
availity.

203
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,950
One can place conservatism keep things 
the way they are.

204
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,913
Stop things from changing over that 
necessarily mean conservative in the 

205
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:06,240
conventional political conservative 
party.

206
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:09,090
I mean don't let things change and for 
risk,

207
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:14,210
the tool that's being used to preserve 
this basis it fear is a synonym.

208
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,690
So the fear is being used.
Fear of change.

209
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,500
Yes,
that's it's very deep.

210
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,020
Not just within the conservative 
mindset,

211
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:29,040
but also within the liberal mindset in 
our society is fear of change.

212
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,370
Look what happens when you try and 
change things.

213
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,543
They point to Iraq for example.
Look what happens when you try and 

214
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:37,290
change a country.
They point to nature and they say,

215
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,510
look what happens when you try and 
change an ecosystem.

216
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,640
You can never tell the consequences of 
it.

217
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,590
And then they point back and they go,
well,

218
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:45,540
look what you try and do with the 
Russian revolution.

219
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,463
Look what happened there.
So you always have this constant being 

220
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:50,370
blind.
Look what you tried to do the,

221
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,390
Oh no,
I'm sorry,

222
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,463
but what they ignore is the fact that 
you live in a society that comes out of 

223
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:57,960
a revolution which has got fantastic and
wonderful freedoms at it.

224
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,080
It we had a revolution in this country.
It can be good,

225
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,973
but it can be dangerous at the moment.
We live in a static world where were 

226
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:07,234
absolutely terrified of all change.
Whereas someone like me would argue is 

227
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:12,460
the change can be dangerous,
but can also be thrilling.

228
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,401
Yes,
of course.

229
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:14,061
No,
of course.

230
00:12:14,061 --> 00:12:15,830
Someone like he would argue that.
Now,

231
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:19,640
what I think is very interesting about 
what you're saying Mr Curtis is that,

232
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:23,330
um,
is that when I listened to the arguments

233
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,353
that can be sort of rather complex on 
the things I very much enjoyed about 

234
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:27,614
your films,
is there the accessibility and the 

235
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,480
populism probably coming from your 
inaugural sausages,

236
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,250
the movie in which a deluxe says 
sausages or seems to because Mr Darcy,

237
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:41,480
she revealed to me that the man 
manipulates the docs larynx.

238
00:12:41,481 --> 00:12:43,170
So the,
they'll probably wouldn't have said so.

239
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:45,440
I suggest if left alone long enough.
Well,

240
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:49,160
I think what is the ultimate resource if
all of these things,

241
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,140
and don't be afraid of a little bit of 
comedy,

242
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:53,570
Adam Curtis,
is that a little pal?

243
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,583
Allow the GNOMIC peculiar presence,
the Elfin presence of mischief to be 

244
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:01,850
present in the room.
Allow a tender law to,

245
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:02,684
to advance up your thigh high school,
the on pondering whether you use comedy 

246
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:10,250
as a way of defense.

247
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,880
I use it as a means for attack as a 
matter of fact.

248
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,380
So what,
what I was saying is,

249
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:18,440
is that all of these things come from 
the personal.

250
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,320
But when you talk about keep things 
like,

251
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,820
because one of the themes of your ipad 
normalization is we're saying,

252
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:23,840
oh well,
who's like,

253
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:25,070
you know,
the politicians aren't powerful.

254
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,960
That's one of the great tropes of our 
age.

255
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,933
It doesn't matter if you switch out 
cameron for Theresa May or indeed 

256
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:30,614
anybody,
because there's a self seems to be some 

257
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:32,534
self regulating system that asserts 
stability regardless of what a opposing 

258
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:38,540
force a place in this way.
Now we're like,

259
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,850
Ooh.
Then is a certain.

260
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,753
There's power.
Where is this power upon which we can't 

261
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:44,444
get any purchase that evidently isn't 
the political establishment as we 

262
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:49,340
understand it.
Where is this power actually situated?

263
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,010
Would you say?
It's as simple as that.

264
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,943
You know,
follow the money is the great economic 

265
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,770
interests.
Global economic interest.

266
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:57,330
This is a good place to start as any.
I think it's

267
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,803
John bureaucracies are grown up which 
are intimately related to our politics 

268
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,280
like finance.
I mean,

269
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,343
the interesting thing about the 19 
eighties is everyone thinks that 

270
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:08,134
Thatcher Reagan really were successful.
But actually if you look back and 

271
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,730
increasingly historians looking back and
go,

272
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,070
no,
they weren't they,

273
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:16,240
they came in saying they're going to 
regenerate industry.

274
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,250
But by about 1986,
87,

275
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,263
most of the industry is in Britain and 
America had collapsed because of the 

276
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:22,474
economic experiment.
So what factor and Reagan did was they 

277
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:27,760
said they turned to finance and they 
said,

278
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,313
can you help us?
I mean this is effectually what 

279
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:32,680
happened.
And what finance did said is,

280
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:33,880
well,
we'll lend the money.

281
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,130
Wages weren't going up,
wages.

282
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:39,820
We're actually collapsing at that point.
So what happened is you had a switch and

283
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:40,654
they gave power to finance and finance 
came in an introduced the idea of 

284
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:48,760
lending on a much grander scale.
And the politicians allowed that because

285
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:51,290
they facilitated all sorts of new acts 
of parliament

286
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,113
that allowed for that to happen.
So what you've got is a shift away from 

287
00:14:56,181 --> 00:15:00,020
the idea that you are on a constant 
travelator have increased wages,

288
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:02,420
increased security in the industries you
worked in,

289
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,810
the,
the,

290
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,643
your income stagnated.
And it was supplemented by lending 

291
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,220
money.
So finance,

292
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:12,230
for example,
I've got a great deal of power now.

293
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:16,170
Underlying finance is a deep desire to 
keep the world stable,

294
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,023
to avoid chaotic situations.
So we began to move into that world 

295
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:26,231
where we're always trying to avoid risk.
What then that happens is that that idea

296
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:27,674
begins to spread out,
not just literally in terms of you 

297
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:31,064
lending money,
but the idea avoiding risk becomes a 

298
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:37,160
central thing in our society and I would
argue that we've all become terrified of

299
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:38,190
change.
I.

300
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,550
One of the things that I've sort of.
She's conservative,

301
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,300
yes,
of course,

302
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,520
of course.
One of the things I've intuited,

303
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:46,790
but not yet fully articulate it because 
I imagine it's rather complex and have a

304
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,624
tendency to be a bit sort of a ad hoc 
shoot from the hip of spit from the lip 

305
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:51,680
ask questions later.

306
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Type of a character is that Qa chaos and
their use of chaos is required.

307
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,813
That there's this sense in me that the 
induction of chaos will be beneficial 

308
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,850
when looking at this sort of 
contemporary politics.

309
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:05,684
I've felt as you have articulated and 
from my own experience with the truth 

310
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:08,864
and one of the reasons I was very keen 
to have you as a guest as a matter of 

311
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:10,934
fact,
that is of course like a sort of like 

312
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:15,020
waist deep in like the political 
discourse,

313
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,943
get an ed miliband round the flat and 
interviewing him and sort of being very 

314
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:22,460
outspoken in what became a very 
combatative.

315
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,323
And uh,
what I want to say dialect it kind of 

316
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,290
difficult exchange with Britain's media 
particularly,

317
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,070
is that I felt like this is really hard 
to get any traction.

318
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,590
It felt.
I felt very quickly myered,

319
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,750
you know,
and like being around like the political

320
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:36,380
class.

321
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,380
It will be briefly around Ed miliband 
and the cheeks.

322
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:40,214
It felt like this doesn't seem like it.
It felt like a very sort of a kind of 

323
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,880
jangly and neurotic sort of Coterie of 
people I didn't think like,

324
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,470
oh,
this is the advancement of power.

325
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,200
And then from being the recipient of the
kind of,

326
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:51,970
um,
uh,

327
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,850
sort of,
uh,

328
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:57,260
what I would say a curtailing of 
managing forces from the media.

329
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,423
That was interesting as well.
It felt like it's so interesting to 

330
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:01,334
become the subject of such negativity,
not only from sort of established media 

331
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:06,620
but from people in general because when 
you talk about change,

332
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:09,090
when you talk about chaos,
when you talk about letting you know,

333
00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:09,924
like people like it's very interesting 
like what I felt like he's like in the 

334
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:14,900
story of the emperor's new clothes is 
like that.

335
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,090
In the end you'd say that kid just shut 
up.

336
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:21,920
Stop saying that about the emperor 
parades like the in the.

337
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:24,410
And people get angry to let people get 
angry with you.

338
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,420
If you say something like,
right,

339
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,830
doesn't make any difference who you vote
for,

340
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:29,300
you'll get the same political system 
anyway.

341
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,760
People know that's true and they know 
it's wrong.

342
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,643
And so they become angry with in this 
case me for saying it instead of like 

343
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:37,574
sort of thinking,
well bloody hell that is a pain in the 

344
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:40,910
ass.
But that's reality that that's true.

345
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:41,840
Or you know,
so.

346
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,920
So what,
you know now I find myself interested in

347
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:48,210
sort of bigger and broader topics like 
you know,

348
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,860
both historically and sort of a,

349
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,863
I know historically history.
I think what is likely to be the next 

350
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:56,004
transition given that you know,
liking your film hypernormalization and 

351
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,124
like you've just said,
it seems that the political world is at 

352
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:05,880
least a once removed narrative that 
doesn't seem to respond to protests,

353
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,720
doesn't seem to respond to activism.
It merely absorbs,

354
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,770
it digests seretse,
presumably pajamas.

355
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,763
It can handle the occupy movement and as
you've said in a in hypernormalization 

356
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:18,504
than in other aspects of your work that 
people that have got an established 

357
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:23,610
idea,
which usually comes from religion,

358
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:24,460
like the,
the,

359
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,480
the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
When people can go,

360
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,710
look,
we have got an idea.

361
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:31,380
It's this,
it's fundamentalist Islam.

362
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,363
That those,
those ideas are more potent and 

363
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:36,420
powerful.
What do you think that we can learn from

364
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:37,280
that with take from that,

365
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:38,763
but you see,
I think that why it doesn't have any 

366
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:48,040
traction change.
It's our fault as much as them.

367
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,280
You can't just blame the politicians.
It's us as well.

368
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,080
One of the great,
enormous changes of our time is the rise

369
00:18:56,081 --> 00:19:00,000
of individualism is the.
It started really in the 19 seventies in

370
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,450
modern terms and it's this idea that you
and I believe that what we want and what

371
00:19:04,451 --> 00:19:08,530
we think and what we feel is the only 
authentic thing and we shouldn't be told

372
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:11,770
what to do by people.
It's really strong.

373
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:14,490
It's really powerful and it's it,
it.

374
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,333
Mrs Dutcher was on the coat tails of it.
Punk movement was on the coat tails of 

375
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:19,204
it.
It was.

376
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,480
It's really it.
It dominates our society and the problem

377
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,500
for politics of the rise of 
individualism is that it can't deal with

378
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:28,744
it.
Politics requires you to say to people 

379
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:34,120
as a political party,
come with me,

380
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,193
join with us together and we will use 
that collective power to change the 

381
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:38,914
world.

382
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,100
But to do that you have to accept that 
you're part of something.

383
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:43,960
You have to surrender yourself to 
something.

384
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,960
And for the radical movements,
that was a disaster,

385
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,870
but more than that,
it was a disaster for politics generally

386
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,440
because political parties understand 
fell away.

387
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,910
So what?
Then politicians there.

388
00:19:54,911 --> 00:19:58,150
Let me finish what politicians being 
aggressive.

389
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,220
Jeremy Paxman no,
this is.

390
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,393
This is important thing,
which I don't think because it's not 

391
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:07,960
just the politicians.
What they were then faced by is the fact

392
00:20:07,961 --> 00:20:08,794
that they didn't have mass support,
so they couldn't do the main thing that 

393
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:18,190
mass democratic politics rose up to do,
which is to be your representative,

394
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:19,024
your bridgehead into power.
Because we had become like scurrying 

395
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,723
little piglet.
It's going all over the world and not 

396
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,733
have become a Skyrim piglet.
I've been a strident cantaloupe and not 

397
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,210
joining together to form a collective 
action.

398
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,520
I understand that.
Now what?

399
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,720
There's one thing I wanted to pick up on
that.

400
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,740
When you say something that Adam.
This is a popular podcast,

401
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,613
right?
So when me say something like the rise 

402
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:43,680
of individualism,
what you're,

403
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:44,940
what you're saying is that like,
you know,

404
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,640
I think we can all say that I primarily 
my worldview comes from,

405
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:49,690
but I'm me,
I'm Russell,

406
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:50,770
I want this.
I don't like that.

407
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:51,350
I've got.
Right.

408
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,183
So I've got feelings now like in that 
that's something that people haven't 

409
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:56,014
really examined individualism as a 
component and a sort of an unavoidable 

410
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:03,940
evolution of a mechanistic worldview and
of materialism.

411
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,260
Now we're like,
what are you saying?

412
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,180
Like when they became chronic or more 
noticeable in the seventies,

413
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,014
so my assumption would be then that 
these conditions of individualism is a 

414
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:13,954
side effect of marketing of liked,
but the reason why is it convenient for 

415
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:18,694
people to see themselves primarily as 
individuals because that's how people 

416
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:22,100
really are better.

417
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,703
No,
it's not a side effect of marketing 

418
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:29,701
marketing comes in to make it work.
Individualism comes basically out of the

419
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:30,694
hippie movement,
the counterculture movement to the 19 

420
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:36,901
sixties where you were encouraged to be 
authentic by responding to yourself.

421
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,303
That was the idea and it was a reaction 
against what was seen as conformity and 

422
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:46,600
it was a reaction against old style of 
politics where you were told what to do.

423
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,090
It was just,
I want to do what I want to be.

424
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,090
You know?
It was just that.

425
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,870
That's what happened and it was about 
finding the authentic self.

426
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,330
Yes,
but that was a

427
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,400
the defined as much as anything else,
bites,

428
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,340
cohesion and bias,
this pursuit of civil,

429
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,203
civil liberties.
These were people that were were like a 

430
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:07,630
lot of change came out of that.
On a,

431
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,330
on a civil rights level in the United 
States,

432
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,290
right?

433
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,123
That's absolutely true,
but that didn't come out of the hippie 

434
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:16,090
movement,
the civil rights movement,

435
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:20,440
which is incredibly important movement.
In the 19 fifties in the 19 sixties,

436
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,503
white activists and black activists 
joined together and they spent years 

437
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,013
giving their lives and many cases 
literally up to try and change the 

438
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:30,814
world,
which they did and they surrender 

439
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,584
themselves to that.
Out of that civil rights movement came 

440
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:37,930
what was called the new left and the new
left said,

441
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:39,970
well,
if we can do this for civil rights,

442
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:40,804
we can do this for everything.
And then the movement stalled somewhere 

443
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:44,584
in the mid 19 sixties because what began
to happen was I knew what was called 

444
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:48,604
counterculture rose up and the counter 
culture was different for the new left 

445
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,440
because what the counterculture said 
was,

446
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,710
you're never going to check all the man 
the power.

447
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,450
You haven't got the power to do it.

448
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,130
The way to do it is to change yourself.
It was the rise.

449
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:03,964
It was the.
It was the sign of a new individualists 

450
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:07,064
and it didn't want to be part of it.
Didn't want to go down to the south and 

451
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:13,660
spend years at an anonymity in danger,
trying to change the world.

452
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,330
It wanted to change.
Here.

453
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,410
I don't want to go down to south New 
York named Ian Danger.

454
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,253
If I might say say you are an arch 
example of hyper individualism of our 

455
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:25,270
time.
I find that I'm going to write that down

456
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:29,110
or look out when I get in.
All your responses are characteristic of

457
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:32,350
exactly what I'm describing.
So what then happened is that the,

458
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,193
the the argument shifted away from the 
idea of saying we can work together to 

459
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:41,611
change the world to saying no,
if we can actually be be the vanguard of

460
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:44,530
changing ourselves as people.

461
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,793
Then you change the Saatchi like that.
You change the people first and then 

462
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:53,420
society will transform and that sort of 
work for a bit,

463
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:57,830
but then bit by bit the politics moved 
away and you are left with this idea.

464
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:58,664
You just transform yourself and you have
all these radical psychotherapy 

465
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:05,480
movements of the 19 seventies come up,
which is you need to find your authentic

466
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:06,314
feelings.
That became the goal and the idea that 

467
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:10,880
you actually changed his society as a 
byproduct began to disappear,

468
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,953
and what then happened was that this 
strange thing began to emerge is if you 

469
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,610
are going to be a self expressive 
individual,

470
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,473
which was the ultimate goal,
where you're authentically expressing 

471
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:20,780
yourself,
how'd you do it?

472
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,650
Because actually not many people knew or
had the confidence to do that,

473
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,143
and I argued in a series of films I made
that that really what happened was the 

474
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,100
modern consumer capitalism said,
we can help you do that.

475
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,550
We can actually supply you with lots of 
different things to allow you to express

476
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:38,384
yourself from ranges of cost ranges of 
close to all sorts of products that you 

477
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:45,980
can use to express your individual 
identity.

478
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,993
Which was fantastic for consumer 
capitalism because they could make lots 

479
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:50,264
more different things.

480
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,520
Yes,
but you're not saying then that consumer

481
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:53,354
is like that.
You're saying that the consumer is in 

482
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,550
mass market culture was a response to 
that need?

483
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,630
Yes.
That's interesting.

484
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:00,800
I like because I'm,
as you know,

485
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,600
a fan of the films of century of the 
Self,

486
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,720
which doesn't qualify me to know more 
about them.

487
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:08,510
In the new [inaudible] you've made those
films but like what it means,

488
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,120
but what how I see,
I said,

489
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,013
look,
on one level we're deal the source 

490
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:15,044
material for all of this is human beings
feeling so even when you say something 

491
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:19,740
like,
I'm an arch example of individualism.

492
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,593
For me that means that I'm closer to to 
the precipice of breaking through to 

493
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:25,184
realizing the limitations of 
individualism and what the implications 

494
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:31,070
of the individualism is.
Limits are which is transcendence.

495
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,993
What happens when one,
once more transcends willingly and with 

496
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:36,854
volition through the limitations of 
individualism and back to a communal 

497
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:44,300
experience and back to a cohesive 
experience as a member of a tribe have a

498
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:45,890
community of a society.

499
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,550
Experiences that are somewhat the night 
as a pathway to somewhat being dug up.

500
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:50,384
It's not so.
It's no longer clear what is the 

501
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:55,520
direction for people that feel this 
yearning and feel the limitations of our

502
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,650
experience of individuals of forever 
living in our head,

503
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,693
of living,
in our anxieties of not knowing what is 

504
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:04,040
real because we are living in a very 
limited version of what is real,

505
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,390
the fulfillment of our base drives and 
base desires.

506
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,770
That's a limited experience of being 
human.

507
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,561
Who Will,
who,

508
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:11,394
oh,
anthropologically history historically 

509
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,563
are designed to live communally 
connected as a harmonious part of a 

510
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:21,470
group in a harmonious part of nature.
And what's interesting for me about what

511
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:22,490
you sit there,
Adam,

512
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:26,120
is the.
I've always regarded the consumerism and

513
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,510
mass market culture,
uh,

514
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,483
has recognized all right,
there's this need in people that can be 

515
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:33,350
fulfilled through selling them stuff.

516
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,110
But by you know,
by your own unique ipad,

517
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,130
ipad,
Ipod,

518
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,993
by your own unique torn jeans,
participate in culture and expressive 

519
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,263
individualism for consuming.
But I suppose what we've not yet gotten 

520
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:46,634
to is the,
the architecture of these concepts if 

521
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,350
phenomena.
Like,

522
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,910
do you think there's someone behind it 
designing this or,

523
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:56,843
or some interests.
Because like when you're saying these 

524
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:01,680
bureaucracies are organizing this state 
system stability,

525
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:04,140
like the financial bureaucracy,
you know,

526
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,003
who benefits from this,
who benefits from people seeing 

527
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:11,670
themselves primarily as individuals 
because it certainly isn't the people of

528
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,520
the Yemen and it certainly isn't us as 
individuals.

529
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,360
So who is it that's preventing change 
from happening?

530
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:18,970
Yes,
of course.

531
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,100
Ask because we can say we're not 
participating in a,

532
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,283
in a,
in a like a potent movement because one 

533
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:28,290
doesn't seem to currently exist,
but what is the.

534
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,500
What is.
Why is this idea continuing to dominate?

535
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,930
I think the point is depart consumer 
capitalism is capitalism is not a.

536
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,720
there's nothing inherently evil thing.
It's a,

537
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,573
it's a moral.
It will always spot an opportunity and 

538
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:42,444
it will go for it.
And what it spotted in the late 19 

539
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:44,454
seventies that were there were these 
people rising up who wanted to be 

540
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:52,461
themselves and they realize that that 
allowed you to make lots of a much wider

541
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:53,964
range of products that you have 
previously done before and people went 

542
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:57,744
for it and that allowed capitalism to 
make lots more money and become much 

543
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:01,260
more.
You know,

544
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:02,880
you saw those adverts in the 19 
eighties,

545
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,710
19 nineties,
express yourself,

546
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,390
be yourself through Nike.
Just do it exactly because I'm worth.

547
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:10,224
It was the great phrase,
but then what happened was I think a 

548
00:28:14,851 --> 00:28:17,120
great shift happened,
which we haven't fully recognized,

549
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,973
which is of what I'm trying to get out 
of the film is that is the genius of 

550
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:22,224
modern power,
is that it managed to do what politics 

551
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:25,254
failed to do.

552
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,363
Politics can't deal with individualism 
because how can you have a political 

553
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:33,000
party where everyone wants to be an 
individual and not be part of something?

554
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,080
What modern manager or system has 
managed to do with square the circle?

555
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:42,230
Look at modern social media.
It manages to allow you to feel that you

556
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:45,570
are totally yourself expressing yourself
online,

557
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:50,310
typing it angrily or beautifully or 
whatever you want to do out into the,

558
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:54,150
into the Internet what you feel or the 
time yet at the same time,

559
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:57,930
what you are as a component and a series
of very complex circuits that is looking

560
00:28:57,931 --> 00:29:00,000
at you.
Doing that and saying,

561
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,560
I'm on.
If he's doing that,

562
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,950
then he's very much like these people 
over here,

563
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:08,280
which we've categorized like that,
so we can say back to that person in the

564
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:10,350
circuit.
If you're doing that,

565
00:29:10,351 --> 00:29:11,550
would you like this as well?

566
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,710
And you go,
whew.

567
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,760
All right,
because it's a bit like what you've just

568
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:19,761
done and it makes you sort of feel 
secure within your individuality.

569
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,723
So what they've finished to do 
increasingly in the modern systems of 

570
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:23,814
management is except your individualism 
and your expressiveness allow you to 

571
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:31,410
feel that you're being more and more 
expressive.

572
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:33,270
Where's the same time managing you 
quietly,

573
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,104
unhappily,
so you become part of a very large 

574
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:38,220
group.
That university because you are just the

575
00:29:38,221 --> 00:29:42,040
little components and the circuit,
but the computers look at you and go,

576
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,113
oh,
well there's about 300 million of those 

577
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:47,060
sort of types.
We're putting them in that group and I'm

578
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,510
not a conspiracy.
It's not a group of people going,

579
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:50,344
Oh,
we'll do this.

580
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,333
It's a system that can see from the 
information that it's reading from you 

581
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,643
and lots of other people,
the patterns that you are part of and 

582
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:00,581
saying,
well,

583
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:02,260
we'll fit them all together into that 
pattern.

584
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,640
Absolutely.
So sort of complex interlocks,

585
00:30:04,641 --> 00:30:06,530
taxonomies that designed ultimately to 
go,

586
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:07,680
if you like this,
your property,

587
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,153
that it's benign in terms the.
If you talk to the tech utopians from 

588
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,290
from Silicon Valley,
they will go,

589
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,330
this is incredibly efficient and they're
right.

590
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,343
It's an incredibly efficient way of 
managing the problem that politicians 

591
00:30:22,461 --> 00:30:23,294
can't manage,
which is our individuality and our 

592
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,980
desire to be self expressive.
It's problem is,

593
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,360
is that it's fundamentally conservative 
because it's feeding back to you more of

594
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:34,690
what it knows you like or things will 
change.

595
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,643
Yeah,
but it sounded like a bit like 

596
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,543
Christianity in a way offered a kind of 
have a peg around personal interaction 

597
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:43,424
with Christ.
Your own person or salvation Christ 

598
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,910
loves you as an individual.
Yes.

599
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:51,440
You could argue that modern 
protestantism especially was again,

600
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:56,441
another way of trying to deal with the 
growing desire for individuality,

601
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:57,524
which has been going on since the 
renaissance or before the enlightenment 

602
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,260
decide.
Did you want to be yourself?

603
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,270
So question to some said,
no,

604
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,523
you don't have to be what Catholicism 
says is just part of something you're 

605
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,673
told to do.
You can have a personal relationship to 

606
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:12,164
God and there is a very important posh 
academic book written back in the early 

607
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:18,104
part of the 20th century which argues,
but my uncle Max Faber that argues that 

608
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,573
protestantism and the idea that you have
a personal relationship to God was one 

609
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:31,190
of the great motor forces that allowed 
capitalism to come up because if you can

610
00:31:31,191 --> 00:31:32,024
actually achieve a relationship through 
your own actions with God and achieve 

611
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:39,860
salvation,
then you can actually say what?

612
00:31:39,861 --> 00:31:44,570
I can achieve all sorts of things myself
in the here and now before I dive,

613
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:49,400
which may save me for when I die.
So it actually made you more of a heroic

614
00:31:49,401 --> 00:31:50,234
figure.
Protestantism certainly that advances 

615
00:31:52,641 --> 00:31:53,474
the idea of individualism used their 
sort of star of your own life accruing 

616
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,780
goods and services so that when you and 
when you die,

617
00:31:59,781 --> 00:32:00,614
you will,
you will be a good person and you will 

618
00:32:01,881 --> 00:32:02,714
go to heaven and that gave capitalism 
this idea that it was a fundamentally 

619
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:09,710
good thing to try and achieve you where 
we will work,

620
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,693
and you'll see this in the 19th century 
novels where they depict great 

621
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:12,950
capitalists.

622
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,940
They see themselves as heroic figures 
who are not only helping the world,

623
00:32:16,941 --> 00:32:18,520
but they're saving themselves.
Yes,

624
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,913
I suppose in a way don't we have to get 
beyond the kind of a journalistic 

625
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,390
judgment so of like ideas like 
capitalism,

626
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:25,224
socialism or any individual is either 
good or bad sort of is it that we need 

627
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:31,314
to sort of look up functionally what's 
occurring or like this seems to have 

628
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:34,704
very positive results.
This seems to very detrimental results 

629
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:39,680
and when you're talking about this 
online collation and people put together

630
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:44,681
into 300 million man or woman hurts,
that can be marketed to and as you say,

631
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,300
it's benign.
These things,

632
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,910
not this not happening in a vacuum is 
there is like,

633
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,870
so when you're talking to these that 
that is the exertion and that's the ex,

634
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,740
that's the exercising of power.
We're witnessing witnessing there,

635
00:32:57,741 --> 00:32:58,574
Adam,
that's not happening sort of in a 

636
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:04,970
arbitrary and natural light because the 
people's interests are being represented

637
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,110
through those resources.

638
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,943
Facebook is not neutral.
One of the things that I'm sort of 

639
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,570
learning about because you know,
I'm going to university,

640
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:15,050
she very kindly wrote me my reference 
which have not yet seen and I would like

641
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:15,884
to see because I want to know what kinds
of things you said about me and sweet 

642
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,680
and adorable,
sweet and adorable students.

643
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,250
I hope that I'm right now looking at the
context you're using that in.

644
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:27,990
It makes me think that you fought sweet 
and adorable.

645
00:33:27,991 --> 00:33:29,700
It was patronizing which,
uh,

646
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:34,160
I suppose in a way it is,
but it's also being nice is patronizing.

647
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:34,994
Then I'm patronizing.
So in one of the things I'm learning 

648
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:42,401
about in that Adam Curtis is a,
like the way that secularism.

649
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:46,620
And just so for those of you that were 
new listener to this type of podcast,

650
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,833
the division of Church and state,
that division of political interest and 

651
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:55,751
religious interest has always posed as I
neutral force like addicts,

652
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,540
expansionism and interventionism has 
been justified by that we can go over to

653
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:03,350
Iraq and stick our origin because we are
a secular society,

654
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:04,184
a neutral society,
and they're doing all sorts of Wacko 

655
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,763
stuff with that where the government has
got a mustache and metal from that and 

656
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:15,061
they need to be brought down to people 
to now this a positive as neutral of a,

657
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,043
whether it's secularism or the sort of 
cyber world is one of the ways that 

658
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,420
power has always concealed itself by 
saying this isn't power tool,

659
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,860
this is normal,
you know,

660
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,120
sort of social services,
normal markets.

661
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,110
So sort of a sort of a capitalism 
derived from protestantism,

662
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,200
normal Islam not normal.
And therefore subject to regulation.

663
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,490
The threat someone wants to the great 
the,

664
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,353
the sign of a great ideology is 
something that doesn't look like an 

665
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:45,470
ideology that you just accept as natural
and normal.

666
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,940
So for example,
if you talk to technological enthusiasts

667
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:50,774
or utopians from Silicon Valley,
are you talking about facebook shutting 

668
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:57,050
people off into their own little echo 
chambers,

669
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,093
but they'll say,
but it's sufficient and what they mean 

670
00:34:59,451 --> 00:35:02,870
by that is it works.
It's actually dealing with the problem I

671
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:03,704
was talking about of individualism and 
it's allowing people to be assembled in 

672
00:35:07,431 --> 00:35:11,210
groups yet feel individuals and they're 
absolutely right.

673
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,073
It is incredibly efficient.
But maybe the whole idea of efficiency 

674
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:16,364
used in those terms is actually a 
political ideology because what they're 

675
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:19,814
saying is we constantly keep people in 
this situation by reading stuff and 

676
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:27,530
feeding stuff to them.
And that's conservative.

677
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,110
That's a conservative idea because then 
people but get get,

678
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,143
they'd get frightened of change and if 
you get frightened of change then you 

679
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:38,190
are actually feeding the power.
And what I keep

680
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,840
on trying to point out in this film is 
the real power works not just,

681
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,840
it doesn't work by saying you must do 
this,

682
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:46,943
it works well when we are complicit 
within it because we accept it as 

683
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:51,480
natural.
Yes.

684
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,930
And we are guilty of that.
So for example,

685
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,940
do you remember the,
the um,

686
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,810
March against the war in Iraq and in 
London in 2003.

687
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:06,050
I think it was about 3 million people 
went on that march was terrible.

688
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,933
Did you go on it?

689
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,370
I was still on drugs to care about that 
actually.

690
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:12,204
I think I did go,
but it was still on drugs to care about 

691
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:15,234
it.

692
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:18,300
But the interesting thing about that 
march is it was really the biggest,

693
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,134
probably the biggest protest march since
the suicide thing in 1956 or even 

694
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:23,034
bigger.
And everyone thought that's going to 

695
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:25,460
change everything.
Yeah.

696
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,710
And then everyone went and they had a 
slogan which was not in my name,

697
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:31,920
which is again a very individualistic 
like it as a slogan to you.

698
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,610
Well,
I'm not in my name,

699
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:34,444
you know,
but it's the wild doubt my finishing 

700
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:38,080
your name I think because we've got some
more lemonade we got.

701
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:38,914
Okay.
I suppose it was an interesting slogan 

702
00:36:40,561 --> 00:36:41,394
of its time.
I don't know how the pomposity of it 

703
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,063
sincerity you.
Everyone marched 3 million people march 

704
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:50,040
and they were totally sincere about it.
Not In my name.

705
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,350
And they then went home,
all right,

706
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,770
it's not in your name.
And they said,

707
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:53,604
well,
that's not important.

708
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,513
Well,
that's exactly what what the profession 

709
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:56,544
was.
You go back and the war is not in my 

710
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:00,684
name.
That's not what you don't anything more 

711
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:04,350
about it.
Whereas real change,

712
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:05,184
real political change would have 
happened if those 3 million people had 

713
00:37:08,071 --> 00:37:12,210
again and again and again marched and 
again and worked and given themselves to

714
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:14,520
that they might.
What I've had a chance of stopping.

715
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:15,930
The horror has now happened in Iran.

716
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,110
It's a bit of my Adam,
I've heard you argued before,

717
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,003
the stability is the enemy of change and
we are obviously participants in this 

718
00:37:22,101 --> 00:37:22,934
because we like,
oh,

719
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,773
do you know what?
I don't know if I will be going on a 

720
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,513
million person March every day because 
I've got an x box and I'm moderately 

721
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:32,080
comfortable.
Isn't in fact the ingenuity of a much of

722
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:37,150
contemporary secular life is that we're 
for the significant majority.

723
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:42,340
We are sustained at a comfortable level 
and we can tolerate in our insular cells

724
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:43,844
of comfort the discomfort of others.
Because our empathy and altruism has 

725
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:48,434
been eroded,
these impulses and instincts have long 

726
00:37:50,781 --> 00:37:53,690
been undernourished because they're sort
of familiar.

727
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,010
Communal institutions of themselves 
began to disappear.

728
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,960
What protest becomes feeling?
Well,

729
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,853
it,
yes it does add him and actually that 

730
00:38:05,391 --> 00:38:06,224
shouldn't be to our disadvantage because
when you sort of talk about me as the 

731
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,373
arch narcissist of our time on what I 
think this means is it's like that for 

732
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:15,984
all things.

733
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,103
Returning to the point makes my point 
for me that you are the narcissist of 

734
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:22,520
our time.
I did it as a passing comment.

735
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:23,801
No,
because,

736
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,860
um,
it's something that I'm,

737
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,103
I'm interested in because I actually 
think it's legitimate as well as this 

738
00:38:28,731 --> 00:38:30,830
sort of a blip aside,
you know,

739
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,480
that sort of,
what is it about my,

740
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,580
my personal conditions and the 
conditions of our time that make soaks,

741
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,990
that make me so infatuated with my cell 
phone,

742
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:44,050
my own perceptions because in a way,
how is that different from,

743
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,180
you know,
really from anybody else.

744
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:47,500
It's not really,
it's more pronounced,

745
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:49,450
it's more observable.
I don't imagine that.

746
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:50,111
It's not like,
you know,

747
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:50,944
how could anyone possibly know because 
no one except me knows how to be inside 

748
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:53,974
my own consciousness and I'm not even 
sure that I'm that convinced of how to 

749
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:56,940
do it.
That my point,

750
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,813
my point is,
is that everything's a source is 

751
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,420
people's negotiation with the external 
world at source.

752
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:05,254
Everything is the way I feel when I'm 
interfacing with a society or another 

753
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:13,531
human being or a product or my own 
feelings coming back to me and because I

754
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,733
have experienced many of the sort of the
sort of the icons of success or the 

755
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:20,830
icons of consuming,
you know,

756
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:23,770
have been famous being a proper drug.

757
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,870
Addicts being proper,
promiscuous.

758
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,000
I've like seen,
oh right,

759
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:28,834
these things are not that nutritional or
that helpful is that he's helped me to 

760
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:34,683
reach a point where I'm willing to 
consider ideas such as being part of a 

761
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:41,150
community,
you know,

762
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,350
and like isn't that is law.
That means surrender.

763
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:44,861
Right.
You know,

764
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:45,694
sort of like the idea of surrender comes
up again and again in a sort of 

765
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:51,400
spiritual and religious ideologies that 
these drives.

766
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,780
In fact,
it was the other one said to me like,

767
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:53,614
you know,
like a,

768
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,840
we've been told that freedom is freedom 
to fulfill,

769
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:56,674
are trivial and petty desires,
but real freedom is freedom from our 

770
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:01,390
petty and trivial desires.
But you know,

771
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:06,280
in being able to sort of by yourself an 
iphone or have a Wang in a train toilet,

772
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,323
you know,
think of this as a kind of blissful 

773
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:09,064
utopia.
But what have you just fobbed yourself 

774
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,130
off with?
In my case,

775
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,390
it was a 10 pound fine.

776
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,460
No fear.
So serious.

777
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:19,830
Why are you being so serious today?
What I decided.

778
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,350
You're the funny guy,
so that doesn't matter.

779
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,050
We can all,
we can all be silly together.

780
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,250
You know,
what are the lights?

781
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,970
So the reason I'm using like returning 
to make a serious point at that point,

782
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:31,620
that's what I was working serious is 
because.

783
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:32,521
No,
no,

784
00:40:32,521 --> 00:40:33,354
no.
Because you've touched on something 

785
00:40:33,571 --> 00:40:38,571
really important to note that there are 
to calm you down.

786
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,070
Honestly necessary.
I consider this a form of resuscitation.

787
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,213
This is,
this necessary was if you were lying on 

788
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:51,780
a beach now.
So we are all clever in those edits with

789
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,623
your archive,
but really what he needs is a cuddle 

790
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,920
that come on.
I think I'm actually trying to show that

791
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,890
I don't want to be controlled by your 
comedic persona.

792
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,650
Power of comedy is very controlling 
messages.

793
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,070
That's what I.

794
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:09,120
my point is,
and I am as much a narcissist as you.

795
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,190
I want to set the agenda as well,
right?

796
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,500
What I want you to see that that's the 
trail and what I wanted to point out was

797
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:23,220
that it's not that there is the real 
kind of freedom isn't.

798
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,650
It's a religious one.
It's a different kind of freedom.

799
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:26,484
There are all different kinds of freedom
and the idea of freedom that we believe 

800
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:34,280
in now and we believe is inevitable or 
natural and natural to state is not.

801
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,263
It's a construction.
The version of us at the moment is a 

802
00:41:37,651 --> 00:41:41,660
country of freedom is a construction 
because there are many others and one of

803
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:42,494
the most powerful is the very opposite,
which is a religious one which says in 

804
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:47,354
whose service is perfect freedom.
Is that what the religious idea is that 

805
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,790
the self which we worship at the moment 
is actually a terrible prison.

806
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:58,370
It's a cage that you are trapped and 
again,

807
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:02,010
you are an example of this in and in 
what you've taught them.

808
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:05,570
A terrible presentation is that when you
give a young offenders,

809
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,840
when you get trapped atriox short term 
desires,

810
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,030
it's a cage.
You've got,

811
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,933
you got locked acuitus.
I mean even your logically one could 

812
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:16,190
imagine that the process of consuming is
this stimuli and response.

813
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,073
Maybe it's good to escape from that 
daily grind of having to listen to your 

814
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:24,200
consciousness constantly saying,
I want this.

815
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:25,034
I want this,
I want this.

816
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,530
Which we're encouraged to believe is 
liberation.

817
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,580
Yeah,
maybe it's not.

818
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,230
No,
I think you're quite right.

819
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:31,100
I mean,
when I like,

820
00:42:31,101 --> 00:42:31,934
I like Eva,
I'm sort of quite pop spiritual orators 

821
00:42:34,581 --> 00:42:39,581
such as Eckhart Tolle will say to you 
that this incessant in a narrative,

822
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,590
the relentless thinking,
there's no freedom in that,

823
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,660
you know,
in some and watched where those thoughts

824
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:45,830
take you.
Sometimes.

825
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:46,420
You know,
I sort of,

826
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,130
I'm,
I'm,

827
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:47,963
I'm walking my dog in the field,
so everything's basically not the 

828
00:42:50,091 --> 00:42:53,750
reality.
This material reality is I am a man in a

829
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:55,430
field with a dog.
I mean in my head,

830
00:42:55,431 --> 00:42:56,710
what's happening is,
Oh God,

831
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:59,630
what did I do that for?
This will probably go wrong.

832
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,760
What's going to happen?
Who are those people over there,

833
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,400
but I'm not trying to stick again.
He keeps bringing it back,

834
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,353
you know?
So that is that there is like a sort of 

835
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:08,690
a self imposed tyranny to that and I 
don't,

836
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:09,524
you know,
and obviously like you have just a sort 

837
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,180
of implied capitalism or consumerism or 
modern culture,

838
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:16,760
whatever the hell it is,
isn't gonna solve that.

839
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:20,420
In fact it perpetuates that would.
Because the interesting thing about time

840
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:21,254
is you're right,

841
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,870
people live inside their heads very much
because they're encouraged to.

842
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:28,540
They're encouraged to think that is,
that is the end point.

843
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:29,870
That's what we're heading towards.
Yeah.

844
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,343
But,
but actually what's going on in those 

845
00:43:32,981 --> 00:43:37,480
heads of things that people don't really
want to tell who all the sorts of things

846
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,760
theory,
learning a stout.

847
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:43,570
Because actually if you are going to be 
the right kind of individually,

848
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,443
don't have that,
you mustn't have that and you see this 

849
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,910
on social media at the moment.
Everyone,

850
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,073
the,
the politician who is going to get real 

851
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:54,790
power and take us somewhere in the 
future,

852
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,490
it's going to have to deal with the 
things that are inside our cubs,

853
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,950
which is loneliness and fear.

854
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,530
I'm lonely.
Fright.

855
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,080
I woke up this morning.
I was so lonely.

856
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:06,490
I'm a tell you something else.
God.

857
00:44:06,491 --> 00:44:08,610
I was shit scared.
It took me.

858
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,070
I'll give you a bloody pajamas on.
Foreign knew it was sad.

859
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,870
I'm lonely.
I'm understand is coming down.

860
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,190
Bloody wanted me.
Slippers fallen off.

861
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,310
That scared me.
Stepped up.

862
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:19,000
Appalled that misread his bloody things.
Maybe it will only ever and ever.

863
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,650
And I'll say time you have to tiger on 
the box.

864
00:44:20,651 --> 00:44:22,390
And frosties.
Well I was scared.

865
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:23,470
Witless.
It's great.

866
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,820
It's too bloody late.
Tony.

867
00:44:24,821 --> 00:44:27,730
I said to you this little opportunity to
have a sip of water.

868
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,700
So anyway,
like what people obviously want is I say

869
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:31,350
like,
you know,

870
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:33,730
the solution to this.
There were two solutions as they,

871
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,430
uh,
to submit.

872
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:37,740
There's a subjugation of self self in 
terms of,

873
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:38,574
you know,
because of course self is an amorphous 

874
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:40,440
idea,
isn't it all.

875
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:41,283
So we're talking about the kind of self 
which is this sort of relentless driven 

876
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,620
in a narrative that the two ways I have 
found,

877
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:50,760
because I've had to do this because 
being serious for a while to snatch your

878
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:54,060
mantle of pompous,
pious back backpacks for 10 seconds,

879
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,133
I myself have had to battle quite sick 
because I believe that the disease of 

880
00:44:58,231 --> 00:44:59,064
addiction has it its core,
a kind of circuitous self centerdness 

881
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:03,894
that can only be ended well first by the
removal of the initial substance that 

882
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,000
one identifies with,
in my case,

883
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:10,830
it was like crack and heroin at the time
I got clean.

884
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,873
Once those things gone,
you recognize those drives are still 

885
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:15,060
present.
If you,

886
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,070
what is it?
And it become obsessed with food.

887
00:45:17,071 --> 00:45:17,904
You become obsessed with sex,
you become obsessed with work and other 

888
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:22,620
people's opinion.
And in the end,

889
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:25,230
you recognize that the only way to end 
this,

890
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:26,540
this,
the,

891
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,373
the torture of self obsession is for 
ideas that have always been present in 

892
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:34,410
spiritual and religious doctrine,
service,

893
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,270
connection in it.

894
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:37,500
What was that?
In his service,

895
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:41,300
we are free in whose service is perfect 
freedom and whose service is perfect for

896
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,680
self up to something beyond yourself.
So beautiful.

897
00:45:43,681 --> 00:45:44,514
Even give yourself up is an idiom that 
implies that there is an output 

898
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,300
transcendent to trajectory.
I mean the other interesting area that,

899
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:56,430
that in this is the modern ideas of love
are about satisfying yourself.

900
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,310
Whereas the old idea of love,
where you live,

901
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,163
you,
you surrender yourself to someone else 

902
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,680
and it's thrilling but frightening 
because you,

903
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:05,514
you,
you give yourself up and that kind of 

904
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:08,910
love has disappeared.
It would come back.

905
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,670
Would you say your love for me,
it's a little bit like that.

906
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,770
You're a bit like a sort of a modern 
archive.

907
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,604
Troubadour making wonderful.
I know that hypernormalisation was in 

908
00:46:18,121 --> 00:46:18,954
some level of dedicated to me,
it could have been called hyper Russell 

909
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,860
brand ization cut.
This could actually remember,

910
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:27,390
I love you.
So you're quite safe.

911
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,850
Me,
you have like a school teacher.

912
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:37,020
So I agreed to come babysit,
not being pilloried confusing love.

913
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,680
Go to pitch it.
Conflict with the muppet show,

914
00:46:42,681 --> 00:46:45,140
Russell,
it's already been out last week.

915
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:48,470
So

916
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:49,303
the,
I am,

917
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:50,383
look what I want to get from you is this
now what you've just said is like 

918
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:56,160
someone is going to make headway in the 
political sphere and you know,

919
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:58,790
and obviously like I assume on some 
level that would be me.

920
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,793
He's got someone that will know how to 
close that gap between the solipsistic 

921
00:47:03,831 --> 00:47:05,570
circuitry.
If self obsession,

922
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,870
you can't this world out here that we're
all forced to.

923
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:10,760
Like you can't put the genie back in the
bottle,

924
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,190
you just can't.
The individualism is here to stay.

925
00:47:13,191 --> 00:47:13,960
It's,
it's,

926
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,220
it's part of the future.
Um,

927
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,753
what,
what a politician in the future who's 

928
00:47:18,891 --> 00:47:19,724
going to change the world will do,
is somehow allow people to still feel 

929
00:47:23,031 --> 00:47:23,864
they're individuals.
Yet at the same time will say if you 

930
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:30,370
come together,
we can actually the world and something

931
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,000
extraordinary and,
and,

932
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,700
and,
and it will be thrilling,

933
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,820
but it will also be frightening.
And take them into that world.

934
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:37,773
No one's managed to do it.
The moment what's happened is a lot of 

935
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:43,030
the managerial systems have managed to 
make people feel they're individuals,

936
00:47:43,031 --> 00:47:46,000
but manage them.
And we've got to transcend that.

937
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:46,883
I mean,
I think it may somehow come out to the 

938
00:47:47,761 --> 00:47:51,000
internet in some way or another because 
it's a mass communication tool.

939
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:52,423
It can create constituencies globally.
They're not defined by geography states 

940
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,160
and old,
but at the moment the technologist,

941
00:47:57,161 --> 00:47:57,994
the engineering people who dominated 
applying an engineering model to an 

942
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:05,620
engineering models are about feedback 
and they say they constantly read you in

943
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:09,430
the past and feed more back to you.
It doesn't have to be like that,

944
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:10,923
but it needs.
What it needs is a content or a vision 

945
00:48:13,451 --> 00:48:14,284
of the future.

946
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:15,403
And it hasn't got one at the moment.
I'll work it out by the end of the 

947
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:17,620
podcast now.
Well,

948
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,700
there's some of the more prosaic,
uh,

949
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:20,643
aspects of a contemporary life.
What'd you think of old Trumpkins 

950
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,611
Pumpkin then?
What do you think?

951
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:25,444
Why is this happening?
I have a very cynical theory about 

952
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:28,660
Donald Trump got one.
Well,

953
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,440
as us politics became more and more 
deracinated and what does that mean?

954
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:35,854
Deracinated thinned out the resonated 
and sort of less and less substantial 

955
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,820
and less and less able to change things 
or confidently able to change things and

956
00:48:48,821 --> 00:48:53,470
power shifted away to all sorts of other
things that we were participating in.

957
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,400
Really what people like trump part is,
they've become,

958
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,860
they're not really politicians,
they're pantomime villains.

959
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,930
They've turned politics into a 
Vaudeville.

960
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,860
And what will they do is they come on 
stage and we go,

961
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:08,080
this is outrageous in big capitals.

962
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,730
This is absolutely terrible.
We packed,

963
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:14,170
we tap away on social media saying this 
is really,

964
00:49:14,171 --> 00:49:15,310
really,
really bad.

965
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:18,000
And as I say in the film,
uh,

966
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:23,370
a marketeer for online.
So every once angry people clickable and

967
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,550
clicks are gold dust.
And really what those cliques do is feed

968
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,940
modern power and everything stays the 
same.

969
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,910
And do you mean feed modern power 
editor?

970
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:33,910
But if you,
if,

971
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,160
if you click a lot,
yeah,

972
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:39,130
you're actually,
that's what social,

973
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:39,993
those who run social media benefit from,
you're actually keeping the whole thing 

974
00:49:43,151 --> 00:49:46,420
churning over everything.
There's a lot of power in that world.

975
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:47,883
If you have something like facebook,
which in its newsfeeds increasingly 

976
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,433
gives you what it knows you like and 
what you you and what and what you hear 

977
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:58,954
is what you like.
Then that's incredibly powerful because 

978
00:50:01,151 --> 00:50:01,984
it's actually people's reality because 
you are shaping what they know and 

979
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:05,850
you're shaping a Bible.

980
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,360
What you don't know.
Now,

981
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:10,510
those who run social media,
we'll say this is efficient.

982
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,460
They're not.
They're not ideologists.

983
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,470
They're not saying,
we must tell them this,

984
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,460
and in fact it's the algorithms that are
doing that.

985
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:17,980
Of course they've designed the 
algorithms,

986
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:18,963
but the algorithms function is to give 
you more of what it knows you like 

987
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,290
because that's efficient,
but look at what that means.

988
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,100
That means that you only know what 
others like you know,

989
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,293
and then there's another group over 
there who know what they know that the 

990
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:37,160
others in their group now and they never
meet.

991
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,023
I mean,
there's a fascinating quote of the day 

992
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:43,550
after Brexit from a social media 
activist who was a remainer.

993
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:47,180
He wanted to remain it,
but he wanted to find out what the other

994
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:49,430
lot felt like who were the triumphant 
that day,

995
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:53,240
and he went onto facebook and he tried 
to find through the custom feeds,

996
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,650
people like that he couldn't do it and 
he was actually shocked.

997
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:59,130
I won't read you the whole quote,
but it's.

998
00:50:59,131 --> 00:50:59,964
It's absolutely fascinating.
It's a man realizing that there are two 

999
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:05,150
halves of the world now,
so separated from each other.

1000
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,253
That one half can't actually actively go
and find out what the other half is 

1001
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:11,090
feeling now.
That's called power.

1002
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,493
Now,
I don't think that in facebook there is 

1003
00:51:13,431 --> 00:51:15,590
anyone saying,
this is the world we want.

1004
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,630
They're saying this is efficient,
but that,

1005
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,464
look what that efficiency is.
It's a conservative world that holds 

1006
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:22,604
things stable and implicitly.
What that means is that things aren't 

1007
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:26,264
going to change,
and what that means is that those who 

1008
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:30,590
are in remain making power,
so power,

1009
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:33,830
power cannot move,
cannot move.

1010
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,740
Revolution is about reordering,
reorganizing power,

1011
00:51:37,741 --> 00:51:40,800
distribution of power,
redistribution of resources,

1012
00:51:40,801 --> 00:51:43,440
so a powerful forces for stacy's,
however,

1013
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:46,470
a anodyne they may present themselves as
being,

1014
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,810
if not benign,
then then they are in fact the agents.

1015
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,810
All the establishment.
Yes,

1016
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,733
and then also in those chambers,
anyone in those in your little network 

1017
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:00,490
or big network who comes along and says 
something that the others don't like,

1018
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,590
gets up silently,
ejected immediately.

1019
00:52:02,591 --> 00:52:03,424
The book that that journalist John 
Ronson wrote about what it's like being 

1020
00:52:06,221 --> 00:52:07,054
shamed on social media is a very good 
sort of anthropological example of what 

1021
00:52:10,481 --> 00:52:14,200
happens to people within the network who
say the wrong thing.

1022
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:16,510
It's like being in a village in the 
medieval times,

1023
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,580
you're just ejected if you're the wrong 
person,

1024
00:52:18,581 --> 00:52:21,280
you're thrown out of the out of town 
after the city limits,

1025
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,320
so,
so everyone's.

1026
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:24,303
Everyone remains,
remains thinking the same and that's 

1027
00:52:27,221 --> 00:52:29,320
conservative.
We're complicit in it.

1028
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:32,470
And what's an everyone?
Everyone knows it.

1029
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,233
They know it.

1030
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,540
One of the things that I'm very much 
interested in,

1031
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:38,383
you've said this several times and 
there's a bit in my standup of like 

1032
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:45,500
talking about the morning of the cameras
election and he gives that speech and it

1033
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:46,334
will.
The thing that struck me on a personal 

1034
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,700
level actually,
because the speech that he gives,

1035
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,633
the speech that Theresa may gave,
like the speech that you often hear 

1036
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:55,280
politicians give,
is kind of utopian.

1037
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,143
We're,
we're going to build a Britain where 

1038
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:57,554
people are prepared to work and we get 
the opportunities they need with the 

1039
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:01,670
most vulnerable members of society are 
looked after we at what your religion or

1040
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:02,900
your race is.
You'll be taken care of.

1041
00:53:02,901 --> 00:53:04,780
We'll be able to case you've Britain 
where everyone can participate.

1042
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,380
You think fucking know if that what you 
were saying,

1043
00:53:06,381 --> 00:53:09,110
then it was the reality that will be 
okay,

1044
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,830
but I know that what you're saying is 
bullshit and you know that it's bullshit

1045
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:16,220
and you know that we know it's bullshit 
and yet it's perpetuated.

1046
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,053
Now for me,
this is the distillation of 

1047
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:23,360
hypernormalisation is the disjunct.
Now this other idea of there being two,

1048
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,330
a tandem narratives concurrently running
takes place,

1049
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:28,164
doesn't it?
You don't need to consult the external 

1050
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:32,910
world to get ratification of that,
but it has because it happens internally

1051
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:36,780
as well on individual levels of any 
individual's consciousness.

1052
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:37,614
That one census,
there's the part of the part of me that 

1053
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:43,170
is married to the fulfillment of my 
stimulation.

1054
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:44,740
There's the part of me that goes,
well,

1055
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:47,070
that will just happily use this podcast 
as.

1056
00:53:47,071 --> 00:53:47,701
Right,
okay.

1057
00:53:47,701 --> 00:53:51,930
Then what is another way that I can 
assert myself in the public conversation

1058
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:54,390
and in public life powerfully?
How can I get?

1059
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,233
Because you know,
like I've tried sort of vanilla fame of 

1060
00:53:58,141 --> 00:54:01,110
being sort of Hollywood actor and I've 
had this sort of like this activism,

1061
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:03,960
feynman that weren't quite fulfilling.
What's the next version?

1062
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:08,140
Proper religious,
spiritual devotion.

1063
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,540
Now that will,
that will do it.

1064
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,471
There is a lot,
you know,

1065
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:13,050
so these things don't.
In a way the stimuli is the same.

1066
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:13,884
You know,
the object is shifting in Hollywood 

1067
00:54:14,731 --> 00:54:15,541
fame,
money,

1068
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:16,380
drugs,
sex.

1069
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:18,570
The object is shifting,
but the drive remains the same.

1070
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,613
Now it's only through like know was only
through a kind of a sense of actual 

1071
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:23,610
detachment,
relinquishing and service,

1072
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,490
but I can alter the kind of,
I don't know the modem,

1073
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:27,324
I can know I can alter the engine burst 
or if there is such a thing as an 

1074
00:54:32,071 --> 00:54:34,560
essential self beyond the biochemical 
drives,

1075
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,453
beyond the biographical recollections,
if there is some self is consciousness 

1076
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,143
is something and not nothing,
not some inadvertent byproduct of the 

1077
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:43,853
working of the mind,
the brain rather then then there is 

1078
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:50,370
surely some value in this info in 
attaching to.

1079
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,580
This is quite simple and religious idea.

1080
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,710
I do think that the one thing that's 
going to come back onto the table,

1081
00:54:56,711 --> 00:55:00,220
his religion,
because I think the real weakness of the

1082
00:55:00,221 --> 00:55:01,054
modern systems of managing us as 
individuals is that it cannot deal with 

1083
00:55:04,871 --> 00:55:08,380
our own mortality because the great.
I mean I'm more,

1084
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,660
what's the word?
PROZAC and functional.

1085
00:55:10,661 --> 00:55:12,540
Then you have Arabic religion,
but I do think it's.

1086
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:18,110
It's main function in society has been 
to give people constellation in the face

1087
00:55:18,671 --> 00:55:22,120
of their own death that the sense that 
that when they die,

1088
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,420
something will go on and they will be 
part of something that's going on.

1089
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:30,470
It's really powerful and it's really 
necessary and that's the in the modern,

1090
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:31,630
rational,
efficient,

1091
00:55:31,631 --> 00:55:32,464
utilitarian,
technocratic world of managing the 

1092
00:55:34,481 --> 00:55:37,990
individual.
It cannot give you any constellation and

1093
00:55:37,991 --> 00:55:38,824
I think a lot of the pessimism that you 
find on the left is from that they're 

1094
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:44,104
actually projecting onto the world.
They're saying there's not really as 

1095
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:50,470
good day everybody's going to die and it
becomes this sort of terrible,

1096
00:55:50,471 --> 00:55:51,304
terrible fear of death,
which then colors everything which then 

1097
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:56,560
stops them being optimistic about 
changing the world.

1098
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,633
So That's interesting.
And when you said before about fear and 

1099
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:00,250
loneliness,
these,

1100
00:56:00,251 --> 00:56:01,500
again,
these are sort of a.

1101
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,353
that's an emotional conversation that,
that they're kind of a dry creaking 

1102
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:10,600
arguments of socialism and unable to 
have now.

1103
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:11,434
Like I,
I think about this also often remember 

1104
00:56:13,601 --> 00:56:16,440
that socialism came out of religion,
especially in this country.

1105
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,540
I recognize that it was sort of 
certainly departed from it because,

1106
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:20,423
you know,
for understandable reasons around dogma 

1107
00:56:21,431 --> 00:56:22,241
and because of the,
you know,

1108
00:56:22,241 --> 00:56:26,420
sort of necessity or lifestyle for the 
revolutions of a century or so ago meant

1109
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:26,841
that,
you know,

1110
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:27,674
that that kind of state church and state
power had to be dressed and harmonized 

1111
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:34,930
and somewhat knew it.
But for me,

1112
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:38,440
what that,
what is required is a sort of a,

1113
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:39,274
um,
I used to once again distill and 

1114
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:42,034
recognize what the function of religion 
actually is to help us deal with the 

1115
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:47,590
experience of being a human being that 
you know,

1116
00:56:47,591 --> 00:56:48,424
that politics is no longer able to do 
and no longer aspires to do and which 

1117
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:54,370
consumers in artfully done for the 
previous 50 years.

1118
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,850
But it seems to be filtering at this 
point.

1119
00:56:57,851 --> 00:56:58,684
And now you're saying that these sorts,
of course we're talking about kind of a 

1120
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,504
niche market really aren't because most 
of the world don't sit around on 

1121
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:06,330
facebook.
Are they not in like Africa or uh,

1122
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,630
you know,
sort of Latin America?

1123
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:08,530
Are they,
I don't know.

1124
00:57:08,531 --> 00:57:10,060
I'm not there,
but like so,

1125
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,013
so like you know,
what we're discussing is a is a 

1126
00:57:12,681 --> 00:57:15,280
particular phenomena to our kind of 
cultures,

1127
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:16,443
but it seems,
but I obviously agree with you and in 

1128
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:20,374
fact,
even when I was somewhat directly 

1129
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:24,420
involved in the media and political 
conversation,

1130
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,420
my,
what I felt was this isn't actually all.

1131
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,313
That's what I've found.
I thought I felt like this isn't the 

1132
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:34,150
conversation I want to after.
This is the new shy and Trivia.

1133
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,193
I'm interested in something that is very
direct and very real among and 

1134
00:57:37,301 --> 00:57:38,900
understand a person like what?

1135
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:41,890
What can you sort of think that all 
saints get?

1136
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,490
Not the band science and although they 
were bloody good.

1137
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,343
I'm very true.
I loved those sisters reached the point 

1138
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,420
of altruism.
Service.

1139
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:57,450
Surrender becomes sort of kind of simple
and almost indistinguishable from mental

1140
00:57:57,671 --> 00:57:58,504
illness in it.
A lot of cases I'm talking particularly 

1141
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:04,360
if Francis of Assisi who wouldn't want 
around your calf,

1142
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:06,040
Adam,
bringing goats in,

1143
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:09,010
ranting and raving,
playing the pan pipes on the stairwells,

1144
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:10,503
meddling with your cats,
putting them all in jumpers and telling 

1145
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:13,620
you that,
that the spirit of Jesus in them.

1146
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:15,550
Because let me tell you,
that's what he would do.

1147
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:16,770
And like so,
like,

1148
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:19,420
so this hypernormalization I suppose 
what it's doing is,

1149
00:58:19,421 --> 00:58:22,100
is we're living in a spectacle and 
anyway,

1150
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,380
it's just,
it's too,

1151
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:25,950
now that the words come up,
it's pretty similar to some of that deep

1152
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,880
boys idea though,
that sort of late,

1153
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:30,520
uh,
late 60 situation is in French situation

1154
00:58:30,521 --> 00:58:30,680
isn't.

1155
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,500
I'm saying,
hold on a minute.

1156
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,333
Well,
bloody hell is this.

1157
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:34,380
It's not real.
And then you go,

1158
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,770
what are you,
who are you?

1159
00:58:35,771 --> 00:58:39,790
What is my role in the world that we 
have no access to what he's real,

1160
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:43,480
but we are living in an impersonation of
reality.

1161
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,180
I've never really got along with all 
that debord stuff.

1162
00:58:46,181 --> 00:58:48,010
It's all men in black,
black punk music.

1163
00:58:48,011 --> 00:58:48,844
Talk about that sort of stuff.
I think it's more mundane than that is 

1164
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:56,050
that every,
every age creates its own reality.

1165
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:56,943
That's what power does.
I'm in the functional Paris to tell you 

1166
00:58:58,511 --> 00:59:00,870
a story about the world.
Our story wins.

1167
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:02,830
Yes.
Because what is reality?

1168
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:05,840
It's just a jumble of masses of things.
Gas,

1169
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,640
real power is taking the reality and 
shaping it.

1170
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,713
And at the moment,
I think what you're talking about is 

1171
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:17,180
also is that we are becoming a bit 
distrustful of the stories those empower

1172
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,680
tell us and it's all feeling a bit Janky
and falling apart and what we're waiting

1173
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:22,160
for

1174
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:22,993
is another story that comes in on.
What I find it a bit odd is that 

1175
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:26,114
actually rather than celebrating this 
moment of sort of transitioned from one 

1176
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,564
big story to another,
we're feeling so frightened rather than 

1177
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:34,250
actually celebrating it as a moment 
where you can shape anything the way you

1178
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:35,084
wanted it to be.
I think what's lurking around is not 

1179
00:59:37,971 --> 00:59:38,804
just religion.
There are two things sitting around 

1180
00:59:40,221 --> 00:59:41,590
waiting.
When is religion,

1181
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:42,443
the other science,
the thing that no one ever talks about 

1182
00:59:43,911 --> 00:59:47,840
the memory because scientists has got 
stuck in many ways in dogma,

1183
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:48,973
in sort of weird dogma,
but also because it's all about serving 

1184
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:53,750
the individual.
These days,

1185
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:54,883
scientists spend their time getting 
grants by doing research that tells us 

1186
00:59:56,901 --> 00:59:58,220
that if you eat this,
you'll die.

1187
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:02,030
Or if you do this,
it have a bad effect on your health.

1188
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:04,420
And then next year I'm telling you the 
opposite about that.

1189
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:07,140
Here's another one that is sort of 
reductive.

1190
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,990
It's been reduced to at our 
imaginations,

1191
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,033
whereas somewhat science used to do was 
tell us extraordinary things about the 

1192
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:15,890
world that hidden things that it could 
reveal,

1193
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:19,730
and this is sort of Austin was waiting 
there to be rediscovered and I have this

1194
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:24,731
instinct that what might happen in 
answer to the sort of rather strange,

1195
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:25,664
utilitarian stuckness of our time is 
that someone will find a way of fusing 

1196
01:00:29,241 --> 01:00:32,710
scientific ideas,
religious ideas to produce a certain,

1197
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,173
I don't know,
a vision of an extraordinary world that 

1198
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:38,720
somehow has a logical power to it and it
will.

1199
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,580
The science and religion will fuse and 
it will.

1200
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,220
What it will offer is a way of us still 
feeling that we're individuals,

1201
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,490
but there's another word we can go 
towards.

1202
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:51,913
What do you think would be the role of 
traditional religions like Islam and in 

1203
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,410
in this changing world?

1204
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,640
Islam is interesting because it,
it,

1205
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:03,493
it,
it combines an idea of individualism 

1206
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:08,520
with the sense of community and it's 
powerful that.

1207
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,400
I mean it's.
But again,

1208
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:11,234
in the western world,
it's very difficult to discuss his lab 

1209
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:17,090
at the moment without getting a wave of,
of what's the word,

1210
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:20,660
fear and disapproval because it's been 
so demonized.

1211
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,330
I mean it,
I'm not trying to praise Islam or,

1212
01:01:24,331 --> 01:01:25,850
or,
or be rude about it,

1213
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:26,743
but it is fascinating religion to look 
at and I think I gave you a book once 

1214
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:31,424
which was the history of the world told 
from the Islamic perspective and when 

1215
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:35,834
you read it,
it just makes you look at the world 

1216
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:39,280
differently.
And that's what we do these days.

1217
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,880
That's right.
Destiny disrupted.

1218
01:01:40,881 --> 01:01:41,714
It's fantastic book because it makes you
pull back and look at the world 

1219
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:48,770
differently and we just don't do that 
these days.

1220
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,833
I suppose people aren't really willing 
to embrace that kind of mentality or 

1221
01:01:53,181 --> 01:01:56,150
change unless there is some sort of 
desperation typically.

1222
01:01:56,151 --> 01:01:58,560
And traditionally people don't like,
you know,

1223
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:02,600
say like Latin revolutions in sort of a 
bit off this mic.

1224
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:03,434
People are concerned,
but my voice isn't as deep and booming 

1225
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:09,500
dominant as he me.
I'm like that,

1226
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,013
you know,
typically revolutions happen when the 

1227
01:02:12,651 --> 01:02:16,010
conditions are correct,
when people are galvanized.

1228
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,840
Norml is an element of desperation,
but done.

1229
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:20,040
There's always someone who comes along 
crystallizes it.

1230
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:20,874
I mean,
I've always been fascinated by the 

1231
01:02:21,211 --> 01:02:23,600
Iranian revolution,
how many came along.

1232
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,730
I mean he and,
and he managed to assemble three or four

1233
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:31,170
different groups in society and somehow 
gave them a common identity.

1234
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:33,930
He didn't just killed off about two of 
the other groups.

1235
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,760
He's going really well and he's got,
oh,

1236
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:39,870
the few execution is towards the back 
end of their evolution.

1237
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:42,720
A master's right.
But got up until then.

1238
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:43,651
Well,
I mean,

1239
01:02:43,651 --> 01:02:44,484
what Romania did is he realized that 
there was a whole massive group of 

1240
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:47,994
people who'd moved into the cities over 
the last 10 years in the 19 seventies 

1241
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:55,910
who were really pissed off and felt 
completely alone.

1242
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:57,653
And he saw that group and he also saw 
that there was a group of middle class 

1243
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:01,823
left wing activists and he put the two 
together because what he did with this 

1244
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:06,270
lamb is he said,
no,

1245
01:03:06,271 --> 01:03:09,390
we can put it to the size it.
He pushed aside Islam,

1246
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,880
especially sheer Islam,
which had always seen itself as quiet.

1247
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:14,743
It wasn't going to take an active role 
in the world and that was its tradition 

1248
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:21,840
and he did it brilliantly and he then 
took power and you got rid of the middle

1249
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:25,480
class activist.
He's just shot them around here.

1250
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,573
Well,
it revolutions are brutal and 

1251
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:32,340
frightening and this is the thing that 
one has to go back to.

1252
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:35,490
If you want change,
if you really want to change the world,

1253
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,533
you have to tackle power and when you 
tackle it's quite rough and things will 

1254
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:42,594
get quite.
What's the word iffy and I think the 

1255
01:03:46,681 --> 01:03:47,514
middle class is might find it a bit 
difficult and I remember once having at 

1256
01:03:50,281 --> 01:03:52,380
a thing with you when we were talking 
about this,

1257
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:55,530
just turning to the audience and saying,
well actually really?

1258
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,390
You talk about revolution.
You talk about change.

1259
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:58,403
Do you really wanted it?
Will change the world massively for you 

1260
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,010
or do you just want the banks to be a 
little bit nicer?

1261
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:07,710
Is that it?
I think,

1262
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,990
and there was complete silence because 
actually I do think at the moment in the

1263
01:04:12,991 --> 01:04:15,000
West people genuinely,
they're nice,

1264
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:16,800
they're good,
they really want change,

1265
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:17,993
but they want change that isn't really 
going to disrupt the world and I'm not 

1266
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:21,354
sure that's really possible if you 
really want to give a voice and a power 

1267
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:26,183
and a sense of confidence to all those 
people outside the city who are feeling 

1268
01:04:29,761 --> 01:04:33,600
lonely and uncertain and living 
completely.

1269
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:34,763
What's the word?
Uncertain lives have no sense of their 

1270
01:04:36,241 --> 01:04:37,950
own confidence.
Confident Future.

1271
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,083
You're going to have to change things 
quite substantially and you're going to 

1272
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:43,710
have to take on really vested interest.
That's going to be quite frightening.

1273
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:45,270
You got to be willing to give up 
everything is it.

1274
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:48,690
I think that like the difference between
a priest and a prophet,

1275
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,910
someone explained to me was the,
uh,

1276
01:04:50,911 --> 01:04:53,310
the willingness to live it,
the willingness.

1277
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:54,144
They were like,
yeah,

1278
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,193
I'll sacrifice everything.
And I go back to the civil rights 

1279
01:04:57,271 --> 01:05:01,320
movement in the 19 fifties and America 
white middle class activists went to the

1280
01:05:01,321 --> 01:05:02,154
south and they gave up their lives for 
years to do something that they thought 

1281
01:05:06,661 --> 01:05:09,270
was morally right.
And as someone wrote the other day,

1282
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:10,163
you cannot imagine that happening now.
They'd want to be telling everyone that 

1283
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:14,260
they're doing it.
Yeah.

1284
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:15,173
Yeah.
Because that's how you get validated 

1285
01:05:16,351 --> 01:05:18,160
these days as an.
You want

1286
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,980
people to know that you're doing it,
but you're right.

1287
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:21,700
Most of the heroes of the civil rights 
movement,

1288
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,460
especially with remained anonymous,
of course.

1289
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:25,990
Precisely.
Now again,

1290
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:31,340
what you're talking about is a I vialed 
spiritual idea because that is about,

1291
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,343
yes,
it is because it's about the 

1292
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:34,900
transcendence of your individualism that
you can't.

1293
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:35,763
That you're not going to receive 
validation from anyone in here who 

1294
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,750
surface.
We also politics.

1295
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:43,690
Politics is about giving yourself up to 
some,

1296
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,400
an idea beyond yourself.
So it's religion and it's its,

1297
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:51,250
its dominant idea about how you,
how you deal with a dynamic world.

1298
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,380
At the moment,
we pretend the load is stable,

1299
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,090
but it's not going to be.
It can't.

1300
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,350
Now,
and in fact it isn't,

1301
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:01,380
I mean the fact that I had a wicked 
quote from derailed our show and it sort

1302
01:06:01,511 --> 01:06:04,660
of rings incredibly true given the 
actuality,

1303
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:07,990
the cosmic actuality,
not just our time,

1304
01:06:07,991 --> 01:06:09,610
but of all time said,
uh,

1305
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:11,680
of someone brought up society and he 
says,

1306
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:12,370
society what?

1307
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,800
The society.
It's a clearing in the forest.

1308
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:18,190
You know,
that this will be reclaimed by nature.

1309
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:22,780
We are in infinite space.
So your point about order and stability,

1310
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,673
these things are always temporal.
The idea of ongoing stability in 

1311
01:06:28,061 --> 01:06:33,061
limitless chaos when the actual code we 
are being cradled by absolute chaos is,

1312
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:38,590
it's an anathema and it's unsustainable.
It is unsustainable.

1313
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:41,000
It can't continue,
but it will review.

1314
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:44,230
But it doesn't mean you can't try and 
achieve good things.

1315
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:44,790
I mean,
there are two now.

1316
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:48,070
It doesn't mean that there are two types
of political ideas have changed.

1317
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:51,310
One is that you can actually seize 
history and Tony or way,

1318
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:53,980
which is sort of what Napoleon has tried
to do.

1319
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,900
His great example.
The other is,

1320
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,190
is that you,
you,

1321
01:06:58,230 --> 01:06:59,063
you understand that the world is chaos 
and you see a moment where you can use 

1322
01:07:02,831 --> 01:07:06,070
the chaos,
morally achieve what you want to do.

1323
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,230
And that's the other way of changing the
world,

1324
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,340
that it's about opportunity,
but you have to do that.

1325
01:07:12,341 --> 01:07:13,174
You have to have a picture in your mind 
or what you are trying to get towards 

1326
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,350
what you think is good and then you 
adjust as the chaos around you changes.

1327
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:21,760
And,
but,

1328
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,640
but,
but we do know that we think this is it.

1329
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:25,533
These ideologies are all.
I have to be sort of pretty reactive in 

1330
01:07:28,421 --> 01:07:29,290
a sense though,
Adam,

1331
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:31,300
because otherwise,
how do you fashion them?

1332
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:34,570
Even if you talk about one of the most,
sort of a radical,

1333
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:39,130
murderous,
but sort of a vivid narratives to emerge

1334
01:07:39,131 --> 01:07:43,240
like knit sort of 20th century fascism 
is like,

1335
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:46,720
that was a response to economic and 
political conditions.

1336
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:49,060
You can't just out of nowhere go,
let's do this thing.

1337
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:49,923
The land is alive.
We are a folk and that's where it's 

1338
01:07:51,971 --> 01:07:52,804
frightening change.
I mean that was a response to chaos in 

1339
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:57,140
the 19 twenties.
Um,

1340
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:57,820
and,
and,

1341
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:00,520
and remember that they were socialists 
to begin with finances.

1342
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,443
Yeah,
national socialists and they had seen 

1343
01:08:03,131 --> 01:08:03,964
the chaos at the market in America and 
in Europe and they reacted against it 

1344
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:09,070
and said,
no,

1345
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:12,250
we are going to organize this and we are
going to go towards this.

1346
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,270
And it's very dangerous.
I mean,

1347
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,490
the other argument is that all rhetoric 
about revolution

1348
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:17,323
at the moment is just rhetoric because 
the experience of our generation of our 

1349
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:24,800
time is a century of revolutions that 
went badly wrong.

1350
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:25,693
Yeah.
And the last thing we want is one or 

1351
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,513
more of them.
And then actually what we were creating 

1352
01:08:30,741 --> 01:08:32,720
in reaction is a very conservative 
moment,

1353
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:35,810
a counterrevolutionary moment.
That's what we're living through.

1354
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:36,733
And it may go on for quite a long time.
And all arguments about revolutionary 

1355
01:08:40,071 --> 01:08:42,890
change are just like quarterly behavior.
We do it,

1356
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:45,230
but we don't really expect it's ever 
going to happen.

1357
01:08:45,231 --> 01:08:48,860
This is a cynical view,
but maybe that's how history works.

1358
01:08:48,861 --> 01:08:49,694
You go through a period of intense 
revolution which does change the world 

1359
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:55,003
and then you have a counter revolution 
which which is actually born out of the 

1360
01:08:58,310 --> 01:08:59,143
the,
the,

1361
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:03,290
the social classes that came out of 
those revolutions that failed,

1362
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:04,124
but it led to a new class breaking 
through and now they want everything to 

1363
01:09:07,281 --> 01:09:08,114
be stapled and that the argument about 
what people like Mrs Thatcher and 

1364
01:09:11,271 --> 01:09:12,104
President Reagan we're about is that a 
new lower middle class which we're 

1365
01:09:16,071 --> 01:09:21,071
confident rose up in the 19 seventies 
and wanted its place in society and they

1366
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:22,590
let me read.

1367
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:26,960
Thatcher and Reagan left that class 
through economically new labor,

1368
01:09:26,961 --> 01:09:27,794
let it through culturally and socially 
and gave it confidence and now he wants 

1369
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:31,844
everything to stop and be stable and the
systems of management that we have got 

1370
01:09:36,501 --> 01:09:37,334
him placed.
I'm talking about keeping everything 

1371
01:09:38,211 --> 01:09:41,160
stable are a reflection of that class,
that path,

1372
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,033
new classes,
desire for stability and we may be in 

1373
01:09:44,901 --> 01:09:46,610
this for the longterm longterm,

1374
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:48,010
but of course again,
these things,

1375
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:52,400
these are quite isolated interests like 
on a global level,

1376
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:54,190
aren't they adam?
I mean,

1377
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:56,870
or do you like.
Because when I'm.

1378
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,950
When you take something that I think 
ultimately there has to be a resource,

1379
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:01,813
like any management of power,
the resource has to be sort of the 

1380
01:10:03,801 --> 01:10:05,500
feelings of the people,
you know,

1381
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:07,910
and of course people can be manipulated,
directed,

1382
01:10:07,911 --> 01:10:08,744
encouraged.
There's all sorts of things that can 

1383
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:10,200
happen to,
you know,

1384
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,320
but we'll look at the way we consume,
look at the things we do,

1385
01:10:12,321 --> 01:10:13,550
the places we go,
what we were.

1386
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:14,384
Obviously people's desires can be 
management related and moved around the 

1387
01:10:17,241 --> 01:10:18,074
question.
But like when you're talking about when 

1388
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:20,530
you sort of,
um,

1389
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,690
when he becomes quite defined and 
specific is it just did.

1390
01:10:23,691 --> 01:10:24,710
When you talk about like,
you know,

1391
01:10:24,711 --> 01:10:25,544
like sort of a,
a generation of people going through 

1392
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:30,470
batteries and then sort of is in or 
whatever we would call it.

1393
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,780
And now that makes sense to me as a 
narrative.

1394
01:10:32,781 --> 01:10:34,460
It makes perfect sense.
But again,

1395
01:10:34,461 --> 01:10:38,120
we're talking like to wield such 
incredible influence.

1396
01:10:38,121 --> 01:10:40,670
We're talking about a very small 
phenomenon,

1397
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:41,533
aren't we?
We're talking about sort of a class of 

1398
01:10:42,411 --> 01:10:43,310
people in Western Europe.

1399
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:45,610
You're living in America where we're 
living in our bubble,

1400
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,340
in history and in geography.
There are all sorts of other,

1401
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,203
I mean the sad thing about our time is 
there are all sorts of other things 

1402
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:52,624
happening outside our bubble,
but because we're so scared of change 

1403
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:57,730
and we're scared of looking outside and 
we're scared of the future,

1404
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,310
we don't really see them.
I always think the thing about our time,

1405
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,160
which is sad,
is that we're a bit like,

1406
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,053
you know when things go wrong in an 
airplane or you're encouraged to adopt 

1407
01:11:06,521 --> 01:11:09,520
what they call the brace position,
where you hunker down,

1408
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:10,503
you're too frightened.
Jakarta window because you can see the 

1409
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:14,550
wind going up and down like that.
That's where we are at the moment.

1410
01:11:14,551 --> 01:11:15,384
We're,
we're refusing to look outside and see 

1411
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:18,264
another.
I do all my plain Jane is embrace 

1412
01:11:19,771 --> 01:11:22,140
position since I've got on before they 
bring the food.

1413
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:23,183
Braise,
braise,

1414
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:24,550
Mr.
it was still brochure.

1415
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:32,540
Yeah.
We're embrace position at um,

1416
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:33,940
we're looking at your phone.
Say,

1417
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:34,783
look him.
I've never known anyone so keen to 

1418
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:38,330
manage and keep things stable.
Then Adam.

1419
01:11:38,331 --> 01:11:40,790
Curtis,
it's bloody you.

1420
01:11:40,791 --> 01:11:43,370
Every time a little bit of chaos comes 
from the underneath,

1421
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,410
from the upside down,
from the other world,

1422
01:11:45,411 --> 01:11:47,570
from the Nether region,
from the other place,

1423
01:11:47,571 --> 01:11:48,404
from the shadow lands.
You look down at your smartphone so 

1424
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,430
vehemently and aggressively.
Not Enough,

1425
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:58,610
having met.
Don't like Lord Palmerston.

1426
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:02,880
Do you know much about no pack course?
Are these appropriate?

1427
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:04,130
A stove pipe pattern?

1428
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,450
Oh No.

1429
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:11,163
Lord Palmerston,
a biography by Russell brand based on 

1430
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:18,280
noise and one fact,
fact bearing his name.

1431
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,770
I don't even know if he was.
Which part he was in liberals,

1432
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:23,370
conservatives.
I don't even remember the names of Adam.

1433
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:25,180
Thank you for coming in in here.
Pleasure.

1434
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:28,900
You know I love you very much.
I do know that.

1435
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,880
I wonder where you fit into all this in 
your emotional life.

1436
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:38,990
You are happier this some things 
manifesting itself.

1437
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,120
I don't think it's just pure narcissism,
but even if it is,

1438
01:12:43,121 --> 01:12:45,730
it's very powerful.
Too Real.

1439
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:47,950
I wonder what's happening for you in the
world.

1440
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:50,933
I was being serious that you.
You are a sort of the persona you have 

1441
01:12:53,611 --> 01:12:57,990
created as a comedian is the arch 
narcissistic or age you.

1442
01:12:57,991 --> 01:12:58,824
You play on that and you,
but you are self conscious about it and 

1443
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,333
in that sense you are,
what's the word and example of modern 

1444
01:13:04,411 --> 01:13:08,100
social realism because everyone lives in
their heads these days.

1445
01:13:08,101 --> 01:13:09,510
Like you said,
they just do.

1446
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:10,703
They don't live outside and most modern 
novels or or the internal monologue 

1447
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:17,890
anyway,
you're an exponent's your you,

1448
01:13:17,891 --> 01:13:18,724
you,
you,

1449
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:22,140
you demonstrate that in three 
dimensional space.

1450
01:13:22,141 --> 01:13:25,080
You,
you're very good at doing the,

1451
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,033
bringing out the consciousness,
the way people live in their heads all 

1452
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:32,280
the time and you express it in a big,
what you would call comedic way.

1453
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,140
Well,
it is objective.

1454
01:13:34,141 --> 01:13:36,300
Really.
Comedy is a discipline.

1455
01:13:36,301 --> 01:13:40,230
It's an art form.
You don't have to call it what you would

1456
01:13:40,231 --> 01:13:43,860
call and what you're keeping bumping up 
against is what lies beyond that.

1457
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,220
Yeah,
and is it religion or is that it?

1458
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:51,360
Oh,
it is

1459
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:53,093
these religion in the sense of like that
I in spite of being on a course of 

1460
01:13:56,161 --> 01:13:57,690
religion and global politics where they 
tell me,

1461
01:13:57,730 --> 01:13:58,563
this is not the definition,
but I believe that religion is where we 

1462
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:02,790
interface with the divine.
We're like,

1463
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:03,624
this is where the thing.
I think I said this to you on the phone 

1464
01:14:04,711 --> 01:14:05,670
the other day,
I said,

1465
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:10,050
ultimately our capacity to understand 
information will run out.

1466
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:12,040
We're there is a limit to our

1467
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,430
ability to understand information that 
the information will not run out.

1468
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:16,653
So at some point faith,
but isn't that what religion is it a 

1469
01:14:19,811 --> 01:14:20,644
sense about?
It's about the acknowledgement of 

1470
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:23,343
everything we don't know and a story 
that is based on face trying to make 

1471
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:29,590
sense of what we don't know.
That's right.

1472
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,210
I've always thought that's what religion
was about.

1473
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:35,290
Well apparently plus constellation in 
the face of not knowing everything will.

1474
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:36,490
It'd be nice.
I'd like.

1475
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:37,573
So I think humility might be really good
for our society in the future and maybe 

1476
01:14:41,741 --> 01:14:43,690
we've reached the limits of that 
individualism,

1477
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:44,763
but maybe we haven't.
Maybe this is it because we think of 

1478
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:48,903
trump as a sort of like a sort of a 
gargoyle decoration on the priapic 

1479
01:14:53,381 --> 01:14:54,214
thrusting hard on,
have an invalid journalistic and you 

1480
01:14:55,901 --> 01:14:56,734
could look,
you could look at trump as the fag end 

1481
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,970
of that sort of individualism that 
started back in the seventies.

1482
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:03,690
It means Fagen.
English American isn't.

1483
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:05,300
Yes,
I mean this.

1484
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:07,730
Yeah.
The decade end of that,

1485
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:12,960
that the sort of the counterculture 
sitting around in the 19 seventies going

1486
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:15,490
politics is shit,
man,

1487
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:19,540
is it ends up with trump sort of 
amazing,

1488
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:21,603
you know,
and I can see he has as many roots in 

1489
01:15:23,201 --> 01:15:26,860
the punk movement as he does in,
in the libertarian,

1490
01:15:26,861 --> 01:15:27,694
right wing of the sentences.
And he somehow a PR moment where all 

1491
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:35,140
those currents have come together and 
are showing how to cade they've become.

1492
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,840
Which means again,
we're waiting for something else.

1493
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:39,580
Yeah,
I agree.

1494
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:41,740
Well,
it's time for something else.

1495
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:48,510
So I've been listening to the Russell 
brand forecast with the Great Adam.

1496
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:54,910
Curtis' hypernormalisation is available 
and BBCI player,

1497
01:15:54,911 --> 01:15:55,744
if you're American,
you can probably get it on youtube by 

1498
01:15:56,621 --> 01:15:57,454
now.
You Slippery Hill and the British 

1499
01:15:58,841 --> 01:16:01,210
licensed payer paid for that and what 
did you do?

1500
01:16:01,211 --> 01:16:03,760
He threw out tea into the harbor in 
Boston.

1501
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,580
Will enjoy their film.
Not on nod pendant.

1502
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:07,414
Yeah.

1503
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:09,493
That was russell brand under the skin.
I hope you enjoyed listening to me 

1504
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:16,270
interviewing Adam.
Cut and now an advert for.

1505
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,490
What would you like?
Well,

Get yourself a biscuit biscuits 

1507
01:16:21,531 --> 01:16:24,950
available down at the shops there.
Which ones you're going to get that?

1508
01:16:24,951 --> 01:16:27,710
Well that's up to you,
but do get yourself a nice biscuit.

1509
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:29,030
Not if you're worried about your white 
though.

1510
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:30,830
Make some changes.
