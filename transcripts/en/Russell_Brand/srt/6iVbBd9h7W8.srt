1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,133
Commonly referred to as the rock star 
physicist has been described as the 

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:05,424
natural successor for BBC scientific 
programming by both David attenborough 

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,043
and Patrick Moore on by some as 
England's equivalent to Neil degrasse 

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,100
Tyson.
That must feel good,

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,190
does it if you're a scientist to be 
described in that way.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,203
Not by me,
by David attenborough and I was there 

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,890
when he.
When he said it,

8
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,810
actually I was presenting him with an 
award.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,610
It was a radio times awards I think as I
presented him with the,

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,530
with the award and he stood up to the 
microphone and then said,

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,020
if I had a torch,
should I pass it to you?

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:37,973
And then went and sat down again.
And of course there's nothing you can 

13
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,780
say,
and I've thought about it since the.

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,863
The real answer is that the Columbia 
successor in the way that can't be a 

15
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:52,190
successor to Neil Armstrong because 
David attenborough was the.

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,250
He invented the form really naturally be
documentary was pioneered by him.

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,530
So he's the first and still the best.
If you watched blue planet two,

18
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,710
that he's still making groundbreaking 
documentaries.

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,300
So there will ever be another one that 
is 50 years of natural history,

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,343
possibly what he's referring to in terms
of succession is a sort of 

21
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:14,214
popularization and humanization.
If it could be such word of data and 

22
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:22,290
information that can have previously 
been somewhat esoteric and inaccessible.

23
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,124
And uh,
I suppose that must be one aspect of 

24
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:30,330
your work that's difficult to quantify.
Your personal charisma,

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,313
your particular success.
Is that something that you have as much 

26
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:36,460
impact on you psychologically?
Well,

27
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,863
I mean the first thing is humanization 
is a good word actually because I think 

28
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:44,220
that science is,
I mean,

29
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,030
what is it?
It's,

30
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,650
it's the study of nature.
So.

31
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:48,840
And it's,
it's a humble pursuit.

32
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,893
It's about just looking at essentially 
small things and asking very simple 

33
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:55,610
questions.
I'm a childlike questions now,

34
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:57,630
why is the sky blue?
Why is that leaf green?

35
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,850
And one of those little points of light 
in the sky.

36
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,540
And so the things we find out a demand I
think demand the response there,

37
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,700
especially when talking about cosmology,
you know,

38
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,553
we're talking about the size and scale 
and origin of the university theater 

39
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:13,824
return or questions.
And so I think they demand the human 

40
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,124
response and that's the thing that I've 
always felt I've went out when I was 

41
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,261
little dude,
dude,

42
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:24,600
astronomy,
which is looking up at the sky,

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,513
the feelings that you get from looking 
at those points of light and 

44
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:32,280
understanding they were the worlds and 
understand how far they are away.

45
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,540
And so on.
Our,

46
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,080
um,
our deep and challenging feelings.

47
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:40,290
I think people miss that a lot.
People think of science as the thing you

48
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,230
do in the lab with some batteries in 
school.

49
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,093
You know that science is a switch,
not questions about the origin of the 

50
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:49,044
universe itself.
I think you're precisely correct that 

51
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,843
actually we don't spend enough time 
analyzing that feeling and to continue 

52
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:00,280
the

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,090
comparison between yourself and David 
out and borrow what one sense is,

54
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,933
is that he has a deep love of the 
subject and it means something to him 

55
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,670
and he wants people to understand it.
And that's what you've just described,

56
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:13,504
is that when you are for you,
the study of the cosmos is not about 

57
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:20,290
mathematics and relationships between 
physical phenomena.

58
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,453
Abstract from the emotion,
but very much as if somehow the 

59
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:24,424
experience of that emotion or the 
realization of that motion or suddenly 

60
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:29,060
the relationship between those emotions.
Could you explain that a little bit of.

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,170
Yeah,

62
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,530
right?
Yeah.

63
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,363
I think.
I think that signed the act of doing 

64
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:33,094
science is an emotional response to 
nature and you said you see it with 

65
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,640
David attenborough.
He loves life on earth.

66
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,730
That living things he finds them 
fascinating,

67
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:43,564
has a connection to them,
understands that the idea that we are 

68
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,094
part of one unbroken chain of life,
stretching back 4 billion years is a 

69
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:54,220
powerful idea.
When I always think that you know when,

70
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,790
when you look a blade of grass in the 
pavement,

71
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,370
probably sticking up through the 
concrete,

72
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,453
the,
the history of life on earth is written 

73
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:05,380
into that thing.
So the more,

74
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,130
the more you understand them,
the more you think about the things that

75
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:09,964
you're looking at.
The more powerful the experiences and 

76
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,430
the more challenging the thoughts are in
that sentence.

77
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,430
The,
the fact that in order to understand the

78
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:19,264
blade of grass,
you have to understand the history of 

79
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:24,240
life on earth.
Four billion year timescales,

80
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,880
uh,
those,

81
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,800
those,
those,

82
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,140
I think a challenging ideas immediately 
and,

83
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:30,910
and they're emotionally challenging 
ideas.

84
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,923
So I think science is an emotional 
response to the universe because you 

85
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:37,630
become a scientist when you,
you latch onto an idea like that.

86
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:38,464
And so I want to know,
I want to know what the origin of life 

87
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:42,740
was so I can understand the things that 
I see

88
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,633
today.
So you see in the minutiae of life at 

89
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,840
the continuum of nature and that,
that is,

90
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,480
uh,
through that aperture,

91
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,550
the most profound questions conceivable,
uh,

92
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,220
we have to imagine answers to them.

93
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,223
I think they all,
all the roads of inquiry leads to 

94
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,960
profound ideas and not always actually 
to the statement we don't know.

95
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,210
So we don't know yet if we ever will.
Uh,

96
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,240
how life began probably began on earth.
You know,

97
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:20,074
there are theories that it came the 
called Panspermia that he began 

98
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,480
somewhere else and then was brought here
by cometry.

99
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:28,180
Impact or asteroid is possible.
It's unlikely though,

100
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,533
but

101
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,393
sorry to interrupt you,
but is there any significance to those 

102
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:35,900
theories?
Just philosophically,

103
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:36,734
I suppose that if life was at some point
in his stellar or an eclectic that it 

104
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,073
interrupts the narrative of life 
beginning of on at this point is they 

105
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:46,764
are.
They are profound philosophical 

106
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,523
implications.
Is it relevant and is there any reason 

107
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:50,384
to believe it might be true?
I think it doesn't matter so 

108
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,410
philosophically

109
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,243
because it had to begin someone because 
we know the universe was hot and 13 

110
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:58,964
point 8 billion years ago,
which is a thing we called the big bang 

111
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,230
and we know that they wouldn't have been
any life around.

112
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:06,200
Then we just the physical conditions 
with far too extreme,

113
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,160
so life began somewhere and the way I 
like to look at it,

114
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,620
it,
it lets,

115
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,470
lets say began on earth.
It doesn't matter though.

116
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:14,000
It could have be going to Mars or 
somewhere else,

117
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:14,834
but the arguments the same.
It means that geochemistry became 

118
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:23,420
biochemistry.
So what happens somewhere most likely on

119
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:24,254
earth is that a dead planet,
but in planet with a hot core and 

120
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,243
volcanoes and those things,
a chemical reactions happened in the 

121
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:39,821
oceans which changed from geology and 
geochemistry to biochemistry.

122
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,720
And that's a profound thing.
So it's.

123
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,560
The planet did almost certainly gave 
birth to us,

124
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,850
which is quite a nice age.

125
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,720
It's an ancient philosophical idea.
Very Atlantic gave birth to us,

126
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,370
but that's very light,
light,

127
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,170
guyer idea.
I suppose that,

128
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:55,004
yeah,
that the mother earth in a very literal 

129
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:57,660
fantastic.
It has to have certain.

130
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,600
What about the,
the distinction between a geo and bio,

131
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,920
uh,
a life.

132
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,270
Why?
Why is that so significant by one meter?

133
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,133
By what metric are we understanding life
if there was a meteorological system 

134
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:15,710
that can produce life,
is that not in itself life?

135
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,080
Well,
yeah.

136
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,310
So it's almost a semantic distinction in
a way.

137
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:21,290
I mean,
you're right,

138
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,124
it still just chemistry.
And so when does Geo Chemistry become 

139
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,294
biochemistry?
So the standard answer would be when 

140
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,480
molecules begin to self replicate.
So that would be.

141
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,050
So information can be passed from 
generation to generation.

142
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,860
Once you've got that,
then you have evolution,

143
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,650
wow,
and then you have live,

144
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,630
so you've got to have some physical,
chemical,

145
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,533
chemical,
some molecule that can reproduce itself 

146
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,373
and the inflammation in the structure of
the molecule is passed on to the copy 

147
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,713
and once you've got that,
I think you basically got life guys 

148
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,280
determined as biology.

149
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,113
We can see that as biochemistry,
self-replicate in molecules prior to 

150
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:03,344
that.
It can't be tracked or understood in 

151
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:06,760
that way.
If you've.

152
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,370
If you've got a system which can't pass 
information on,

153
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,640
then you can't have evolution and if you
can't have evolution,

154
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:17,450
you can't get the life that we see today
and it might.

155
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:18,284
You can't even get single celled 
organisms because they are very 

156
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:20,624
complicated bits of chemistry and the 
key thing is how did chemistry gets so 

157
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,124
complicated and I think the key to that 
is that you get something that can pass 

158
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:29,960
information so you don't lose 
information.

159
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,720
You add the information from generation 
to generation.

160
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,913
Physical risks.
This distinction between geological 

161
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:37,394
life,
biological life seems contingent on its 

162
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:43,460
relationship with us as the observer and
how we narrate that transition.

163
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:46,000
As you said,
it's almost a semantic distinction as it

164
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:48,410
is in both forms.
It is chemistry,

165
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,633
is it not possible that our role as 
observer and the way that we narrate 

166
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,070
information is the true determinant as 
opposed

167
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,903
to the observable and obviously 
extremely significant fact that cells 

168
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:03,420
are now self replicating to us as 
observers.

169
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,283
That's extremely significant but only 
pops to us as observers given in the 

170
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,430
great scope of 13 point 8 billion years.
All this happening is some great,

171
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,310
uh,
Aria of creation.

172
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,840
It's a really important point.
I think it,

173
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,700
you're talking about the value of 
consciousness in the universe,

174
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,290
the value of civilizations,
and we know of one place in the universe

175
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:33,210
where there in Richard fineman words,
atoms that can contemplate atoms.

176
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,243
That's what we are now.
And that to me is that we are the most 

177
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:40,980
valuable structures that we know of in 
the universe.

178
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,030
Now,
when I say that,

179
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,430
sometimes people get very,
you know,

180
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,293
people are liable to say things.
I owe human to damaging the planet and 

181
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:49,860
we're better off without them.
This is nonsense,

182
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,120
right?
The point is,

183
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:51,954
the most remarkable thing about our 
physical universe is that there are 

184
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:59,370
places where atoms can contemplate atoms
at one place that we know of,

185
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,660
and that might be.

186
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,060
We might be quite rare.
We don't know.

187
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,510
We've looked a bit and we've seen no 
sign of anyone else.

188
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,150
We we.
It's called the great silence.

189
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,043
Astronomers call it the great silence 
because we listened with radio 

190
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,444
telescopes and we look out into space,
see no sign of any other civilizations 

191
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,440
and so it could be quite a lonely 
existence that we have here,

192
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,543
but therefore very valuable indeed.
Whilst I understand the necessity for 

193
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:29,070
science as the study of nature to be 
based on evidence,

194
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,270
in fact indeed that is its essence.
That is its modus operandi.

195
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,104
That is what defines it does not the 
requirement that until there is 

196
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,624
evidence,
we stay with the assumption that there 

197
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,114
isn't.
Even though we don't know is 

198
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:45,480
parenthesized.
Doesn't that lead to a sort of.

199
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,343
Do you not think that somehow 
facilitates the dogmatic aspect of 

200
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:49,884
science,
which has meant that it's sort of 

201
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:51,624
science has become somewhat doctrinaire 
and informative of areas beyond the 

202
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,330
humble study of nature and it's becoming
fact,

203
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:03,270
a kind of ideology that leads to 
materialism,

204
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,390
rationalism and all of the other things 
that are on that particular evolutionary

205
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:06,910
chain?

206
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,743
I,
I,

207
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,790
I hope not because it shouldn't,
it shouldn't,

208
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,070
but it sounds.
I'm just talking about great scientists.

209
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:15,930
I've just not been able to drink tea 
properly.

210
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,853
Good professor.
Don't put that in your nose if you're 

211
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,763
inhaling into your lungs.
Know I've read about that because it's 

212
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:24,894
got to go straight down into the tummy,
but I think there's and lemonade and 

213
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:31,590
made it a later point.
I think the science itself,

214
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,450
it is,
it's,

215
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,463
it's humble in the sense that it's about
paying attention to small things and 

216
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:39,950
that's it.
So you think about it.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,570
An example would be Einstein's theory of
general relativity,

218
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,930
which is the framework within which we 
do cosmology,

219
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,170
which is the study of the universe.
So these are grandiose aimed,

220
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:52,020
you know,
we talked about the origin and evolution

221
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:53,740
of the universe.
That's a big idea,

222
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,993
but Einstein's theory of general 
relativity was conceived as a theory of 

223
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:58,444
gravity,
which is a theory of how things move 

224
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:02,530
around in the vicinity of the earth.
And that's it.

225
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,600
So it's talking about if you throw a 
ball in the air,

226
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:05,434
what happens to it now?
It perhaps had the moon goes around the 

227
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:12,301
earth or the earth goes around the sun.
It became a theory of the structure,

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,630
the large scale structure of the 
universe afterwards.

229
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,070
And I think that's really crucial.
There are very few scientists who try to

230
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:21,904
begin by saying,
I am going to answer the great 

231
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:27,700
questions.
I want the theory of everything.

232
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:32,170
I want to understand the whole universe 
that is not the road to wisdom.

233
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:33,690
Actually in science,
the roadster,

234
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,290
roadster,
wisdom and knowledge.

235
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,124
Well,
knowledge first and then wisdom is by 

236
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:41,410
paying attention to small things.
And then what we find.

237
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,410
I think because the universe appears to 
be simple at its very basic level,

238
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,033
there are laws of nature that seemed to 
be accessible to us when we seem to be 

239
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:55,930
able to understand and there are very 
few of them.

240
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,580
Then virtually all road roads of inquiry
lead you to,

241
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,340
if you followed them to some depth to 
some,

242
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,073
well the fundamental,
but I wouldn't call them truth because 

243
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,950
we have to say that we don't have the 
full set of fundamental laws of nature.

244
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:12,784
We certainly know that.
So the laws that we have at the moment 

245
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,183
are incomplete now.
Then they break down in certain 

246
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,900
situations.
For example,

247
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:20,734
Einstein's theory doesn't work at the 
center of a black hole or the origin of 

248
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:24,574
the universe.
So we don't have the theoretical tools 

249
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:29,320
to talk about what happens right in the 
middle of a black hole,

250
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:29,890
for example.

251
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,723
So it was more the observation of a 
conditional pattern as opposed to an 

252
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:33,934
absolute truth because we don't know 
what's on the reverse side of that 

253
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:36,790
pattern.
Is it,

254
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,770
do you think it would be there?
They could just be models.

255
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,950
They are going to send models,
which,

256
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:43,120
uh,
of the way that reality works.

257
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,030
What about mask?
I'm like,

258
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,270
we're with the thing that you said about
Oppenheimer,

259
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,990
uh,
earlier.

260
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,063
I was very intrigued by Oppenheimer.
You said that it was his discoveries 

261
00:13:58,151 --> 00:13:59,380
that lead to,
well,

262
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,214
he ran the Manhattan project so,
and he became haunted by it as many 

263
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:05,900
people.
Did you know,

264
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,773
he,
I think he felt that the first bomb on 

265
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,980
Hiroshima was so horrific,
but almost justifiable in the sense that

266
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:19,210
it was a act to end the war.
The second one on Nagasaki,

267
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:20,044
I think he thought which gratuitous and 
he felt the power that scientists and 

268
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:25,654
engineers had given to politicians were 
so great that the politicians wouldn't 

269
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,700
be able to handle it,
wouldn't be able to control it.

270
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,743
And he,
he actually said in the 19 fifties that 

271
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:35,290
he was surprised that we were still 
here,

272
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,423
as did many.
Richard Feynman oil mentioned also 

273
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:38,944
worked on the Manhattan project and he 
said he was very surprised that we were 

274
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:42,664
here in the mid 19 fifties.
He thought that we would not control 

275
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:45,994
this power and,
but actually we have a remarkably up to 

276
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,650
so you know,
what,

277
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,620
70 years after we got that power,
we were still here,

278
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,110
so we haven't used it again.
Um,

279
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,990
but I think that,
yeah,

280
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:00,824
that,
that oftentimes felt that there are 

281
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,170
great lessons for the way that we run 
society in the approach,

282
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,740
the scientific approach which was abide 
by analogy almost.

283
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:13,574
So these ideas that I've spoke about 
already that we don't have absolute 

284
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:16,904
truth in science and we don't think we 
know anything for certain and we are 

285
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,453
humble with the way that we approach 
nature and crucially that our opinion 

286
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:28,970
counts for nothing in the face of 
nature.

287
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,220
If we're,
we can be shown to be wrong.

288
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,310
And,
and we should be delighted when we shown

289
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:35,144
to be wrong because it means we've 
learned something and that's at the 

290
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:37,994
heart of the scientific and Debra and he
felt those things could be translated 

291
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,650
from science to politics and the way 
that we run societies.

292
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:46,484
And then if we do that,
we would have the wisdom to control the 

293
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:51,560
power.
This is a very beautiful ideology.

294
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,740
Isn't it?
And it's sort of not underwritten by,

295
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,933
as you say.
I like the idea of approaching nature 

296
00:15:57,531 --> 00:15:59,630
with humility,
with grace,

297
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,320
with an understanding of our own 
limitations seems to me like a,

298
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,780
a spiritual doctrine that should be used
in precisely in politics,

299
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:14,540
in domestic,
familial life.

300
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,590
This is sort of,
for me,

301
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:16,424
that is almost a universal idea that we 
approach nature up with love and 

302
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,104
compassion because obviously what I was 
very curious about what the one of the 

303
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:25,430
reasons I went to meet you for the 
respect you enormously.

304
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,293
I respect what you've done and the depth
breadth of knowledge that you have and 

305
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:30,530
the way that you've conveyed it is 
awesome.

306
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,880
But I know that as a man of science that
you are.

307
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:37,880
I said Sova famously atheistic.
Is that right?

308
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,230
No,
no,

309
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,190
I don't think so.
I mean,

310
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,731
I,
first of all,

311
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:44,930
I reject the label because I think that 
it's divisive and uh,

312
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,183
so I genuinely think that science does 
not rule out the existence of a creator 

313
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,630
by,
by definition,

314
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:56,600
because we don't know how the universe 
began full stop.

315
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,670
That's it.
We don't know.

316
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,043
Right?
We have a theory of what might've 

317
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,250
happened before,
the Big Bang theory called inflation,

318
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,460
which says that the universe was still 
around but doing something else,

319
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,940
but we still left with the question.
How did that start?

320
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,310
How did the universe have a beginning 
and if so,

321
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:14,144
how did it begin?

322
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,530
The entries?
We don't know.

323
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,543
Full Stop.
So you can't read it from a scientific 

324
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:20,564
perspective.
It is wrong to say that science has 

325
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:26,260
anything to say at all about the,
the,

326
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:26,741
the,
the,

327
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:29,530
the nature of a,
of a creator or the,

328
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,320
the,
the,

329
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,840
the,
the can be that because we don't know.

330
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,280
That's all I say is that I don't 
personally have any faith.

331
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,580
I'd have a personal faith.
Now we can dig into that.

332
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,723
Do you mean faith as in preexisting 
ideological structure that you use as a 

333
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:46,844
framework for your understanding of 
reality or do you mean faith as sort of 

334
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:49,214
an inward that there is beauty and great
because when you said that humility and 

335
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:53,300
all that,
that sounded like a faithful.

336
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:53,800
Yeah,
so,

337
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,790
so I suppose it depends and you could 
talk about this more actually,

338
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:57,300
how,
what,

339
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,850
how you define the word.
I mean to me all,

340
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:03,840
I mean when I say that is I don't have a
religion that I adhere to.

341
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,003
I don't,
I do not know what the origin of the 

342
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:11,940
laws of nature is and,
and that that's enough for me.

343
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,110
Yeah.
I don't really.

344
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,790
I don't feel compelled.
I,

345
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:19,230
I'd love to know,
but I don't feel compelled to go further

346
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,064
than the statement that I don't know.
And I think that's certainly one of my 

347
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:24,210
books.
That's one of the greatest of mysteries.

348
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,660
We are part of the greatest mysteries 
and for me that's enough.

349
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,830
Yes,
yes,

350
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,233
yes.
There's a very beautiful humility in 

351
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:32,454
that.

352
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,633
It's wonderful because what I was gonna 
say is that like that all I do have 

353
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,633
faith and if I,
if I have to sort of unpack it and I'll 

354
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:46,150
move for us to continue our 
conversation.

355
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:46,984
What I'm fascinated by perennialism and 
patterns that are found consistently 

356
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:51,184
throughout human mythologies.
They're dislocated geographically that 

357
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:54,274
seemed to have universal themes and 
ideas and that I later discovered to 

358
00:18:56,801 --> 00:19:01,450
have relationships that can,
to some degree be described by science,

359
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:03,370
by the language of science and their 
spirit of science,

360
00:19:03,371 --> 00:19:06,250
particularly as you describe it with 
such a,

361
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:07,240
um,
what would I say?

362
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:12,330
Spirit of love egg for example.
It was curious to me that oppenheimer as

363
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:13,744
I understand and can remember I'm in 
dangerous territory and anytime I step 

364
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:19,400
towards science review and never cited 
to me like the [inaudible],

365
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,060
I think he quoted the back of our gator 
at the point that the,

366
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,960
um,
the of those tests,

367
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:26,880
those nuclear tests and indeed buddy,
you know,

368
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,350
attacks is it.

369
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,490
I am become death.
The destroyer of worlds.

370
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

371
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,970
And for me that there's something,
what is that they're in like,

372
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,893
you know,
this is the thing I can't get my head 

373
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:40,800
around and this is gcse stuff.
Is that campaign within the,

374
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,430
as it was then the,
you know,

375
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,443
one of the smallest components of our 
physical reality with the capacity for 

376
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:47,134
such enormous destruction that there's 
inconceivable energy with health like 

377
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:51,130
that.
I mean like that one there.

378
00:19:51,131 --> 00:19:51,964
The reason is I'm curious about it is 
because there are influences in 

379
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:59,170
religious scripture that seemed to be 
trying to describe that,

380
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,190
that within the infantile and Somali 
small there is great power that there is

381
00:20:03,191 --> 00:20:04,024
limitless,
that all things were endowed with 

382
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:05,794
consciousness.
These are the sort of like when I 

383
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,970
approach religion,
I don't sort of pick one particular book

384
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:11,650
and God right on with these guys and and
anyone who's not with it,

385
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,970
I'd like to see them killed.

386
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,070
Luckily it's much more like,
oh my God,

387
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,000
they seem to be describing stuff without
the language,

388
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:19,834
without the language or the capacity.
A very sort of somewhat trite example 

389
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:25,810
when dealing with her mind such as yours
would be the,

390
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,703
you know,
the recent discovery of the benefits of 

391
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:32,230
mindfulness,
mindfulness and meditation for Millennia

392
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,123
have been spoken of as valuable for the 
human condition to have an access to an 

393
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,634
aspect of your own consciousness.
That's precisely not about rationalism 

394
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:39,634
and materialism,
but it's about access to perhaps the 

395
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:44,770
systems that very kindly run your 
kidneys for you and all of that.

396
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,980
And so when that's discovered,
demonstrable,

397
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,160
a,
um,

398
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,673
valuable,
it becomes popularized or underwritten 

399
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,633
by dogma excellence at least,
but there were communities and 

400
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:57,844
ideologies that knew that these 
technologies were powerful without the 

401
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:03,364
apparatus we had.
And I think contained throughout 

402
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:08,290
scripture,
people talking about oneness,

403
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,800
unity,
respect for nature,

404
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:13,000
the nature of the soul,
the nature of consciousness.

405
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:14,080
And it's only from,
for me,

406
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:14,914
whether it's from a scientific 
background or religious background is 

407
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:18,400
only when it becomes doctrinal or people
go,

408
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:19,960
this is definitely the answer.
Fuck you.

409
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,780
That it becomes problematic.
Yeah.

410
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,273
Yeah.
And I think,

411
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,360
I mean,
so I would say that I don't think the,

412
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,840
I think the way to access,
um,

413
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,830
the way to build models about the way 
that nature works is to observe nature,

414
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,053
right?
Which is essentially the scientific 

415
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,850
method.
You observed nature,

416
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,770
you come up with some model,
you test it,

417
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,510
and if it doesn't agree with what you 
see,

418
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,880
then it's wrong when you throw it away 
or you that.

419
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,563
So I suppose really if you think about 
the human condition for many thousands 

420
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,710
of years from the time when we first had
such a thing,

421
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,913
it's about,
it's a responds to nature to everything 

422
00:21:57,611 --> 00:21:59,950
about being human is about responding to
nature.

423
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,490
So I would be surprised if if people 
didn't in that,

424
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,740
in those responses that they have,
didn't,

425
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,603
didn't observe things,
patterns and discover things that you 

426
00:22:12,741 --> 00:22:13,574
know you don't need.
You don't need modern science to allow 

427
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:16,924
you to discover the.
There's a regularity in the passage of 

428
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,370
the seasons,
for example,

429
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,840
because you see it.
It's most of what it means to be human.

430
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,400
So I'm not surprised that the.
And also as you say,

431
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:31,630
in terms of how to exist as as a,
as a human being,

432
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,660
than the scientists not going to tell 
you that actually it can tell you,

433
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,863
well,
it will be better review a little bit 

434
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:43,801
less fat,
but it's not going to tell you about how

435
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:48,790
to be content and happy.

436
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:52,750
What would it does is I think provides a
framework of.

437
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,470
I'm not truth,
I don't like the word truth,

438
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,400
but I'm trying to get at because we can 
always.

439
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:02,670
We can always discover things a 
different way,

440
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,960
but it provides you a framework.
For example,

441
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,831
it says,
well,

442
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:06,664
the earth goes around the sun now and it
tells us that there are a hundred 

443
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,060
billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.
Brilliant.

444
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,900
That's one of 2 trillion galaxies in the
observable universe getting heavy now,

445
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,270
but that's challenging,
isn't it?

446
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:19,911
But then what?
What,

447
00:23:19,911 --> 00:23:22,240
what?
What are we to make of that humility.

448
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,323
Let listeners and and I think that's one
of the most interesting things that we 

449
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:26,614
are.
We discovered that we are at it 

450
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,810
physically and insignificant speck in 
the universe,

451
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:32,644
so you can't argue with otherwise.
There are 2 trillion galaxies in a bit 

452
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:36,154
we can see,
but at the same time there's the idea 

453
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:40,834
that consciousness at contemplating 
atoms might be very rare and therefore 

454
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:48,710
we can be valuable and insignificant at 
the same time.

455
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,030
And this is what Oppenheimer meant by 
what?

456
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,903
In his lectures.
I spoke about them not on the podcast 

457
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,234
actually running this show earlier that 
he talks about an idea called 

458
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,120
complementarity,
which comes from.

459
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,450
It came from the early quantum mechanics
studies.

460
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,260
People are Niels Bohr and others and it 
is actually,

461
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:09,094
it comes from eastern philosophy.
I think this idea that you have to hold 

462
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,513
mutually contradictory,
apparently mutually contradictory ideas 

463
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:17,414
in your head.
You have to in order to get a full 

464
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:20,474
picture of reality,
and that's true in interpreting quantum 

465
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:24,824
mechanics and what he said is what 
you've already referred to is that 

466
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:29,670
people have known this for a long time,
that you.

467
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,523
You also have to do it to understand the
human condition run society and it's a 

468
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:40,150
very good example of how science and 
deeper philosophical thinking.

469
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,030
Intersex.
Yes.

470
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:42,480
Yes.
That's.

471
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,313
That's fascinating and beautiful because
I suppose what's implicit in that are 

472
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:52,290
quite fundamental ideas around 
objectivity and subjectivity.

473
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,183
The inner and outer world and the way 
that they relate and the a is out out 

474
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,560
our tendency to regard that the world 
from,

475
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,343
from an individualistic perspective,
Po lead potentially to quite a lot of 

476
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,603
problems.
One of the things I'm very curious 

477
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:08,634
about,
and I know that your rationalism reason 

478
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,880
and what's demonstrable is hugely 
significant and important,

479
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,953
but what fascinates me is that it seems 
that certainly in earlier times people 

480
00:25:19,711 --> 00:25:20,544
were relating to their own consciousness
in ways that somewhat define our 

481
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:25,014
rational understanding.
People were having sort of yoga 

482
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,830
meditative trips and now people like you
know,

483
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,683
for ios going pio,
interesting romantic plants that people 

484
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:34,554
have always used,
have different experiences within 

485
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:37,164
consciousness that tackle this sort of 
ideas that you're saying science deals 

486
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:44,820
with now imperiously and rationally 
unnecessarily,

487
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,990
but the fact that there might be other 
avenues to know.

488
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,033
Again,
I will be reluctant to use a word as 

489
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:50,754
absolute truth,
but there are different avenues to 

490
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,573
understanding different avenues to 
incite fascinates me with the 

491
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:59,610
construction of mythologies.
As you said,

492
00:25:59,611 --> 00:26:02,010
man is continually relating to his own 
environment,

493
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,290
shaping,
shaped by his environment.

494
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,920
The basis of.
Well,

495
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:06,754
one of the bases I'm sure over evolution
is that the way that we relate to 

496
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:09,714
external conditions and of course those 
conditions very and for political 

497
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,640
couches that were early adopters of 
agriculture,

498
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:18,474
have myths that demonstrate that where 
God to sacrificed and put in the ground 

499
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,850
and hunt SSR is as tend to be more 
individualistic.

500
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,080
They know the myths evolve to represent 
natural circumstance,

501
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,840
demonstrable demonstratively,
but what I'm interested in,

502
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,360
one of the things I'm interested in,
professor,

503
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,373
is how can we use,
as we've just touched upon with that 

504
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,990
idea that opened said that itself echoed
a spiritual,

505
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,753
how can we use what we learn in science 
to inform our societies in bloody 

506
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,350
difficult times politically and 
globally?

507
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:54,120
What values can we extract?

508
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,233
I'll answer that and then going to go 
back to something you said we should 

509
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,131
vote.
Routes to.

510
00:26:58,131 --> 00:26:58,964
Insight for thought was really 
interesting because the answer that 

511
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,990
question directly is that oftentime 
appointed.

512
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,260
I said it'd be think about political 
philosophy,

513
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,800
the way that we organize our society.
So you might think that they're mutually

514
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:11,870
contradictory axiom,
so for example,

515
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:14,060
one could be a freedom of the 
individual.

516
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:16,820
If you're a libertarian,
extreme libertarian,

517
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,803
you think that individual freedom is the
most important thing and you might be 

518
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:24,800
prepared to compromise a bit and build 
something in of have a society with.

519
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:27,530
Ultimately you're talking about freedom 
as the base,

520
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,020
the basis,
whereas if you're on the,

521
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,170
if you're a communist or further to the 
left,

522
00:27:33,171 --> 00:27:34,004
you might be thinking that society is 
all that matters and you might 

523
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:40,040
reluctantly build a bit of individual 
freedom in and will often.

524
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,873
Jaime was saying when this idea of 
complementarity is the two ideas of 

525
00:27:43,971 --> 00:27:47,630
freedom and society are inextricably 
linked,

526
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,870
they feed off each other.
They are both necessary for deal.

527
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:51,704
That's who exist,
so you can't have freedom without a 

528
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:54,434
society and you can't have a society 
without freedom and it's just the idea 

529
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,660
that you don't start saying,
Oh yeah,

530
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:04,970
I'm a conservative.
I am a Marxist,

531
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,853
I am,
or whatever.

532
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,873
You have to understand that human 
society and its interaction with 

533
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,970
individualities very complicated and you
need to.

534
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,863
You need to understand.
You need to be comfortable with holding 

535
00:28:17,271 --> 00:28:18,104
those two ideas.
We called them orthogonal in physics at 

536
00:28:19,971 --> 00:28:22,250
right angles,
the mutually contradictory ideas.

537
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:23,770
I'm drawing,
drawing a little as good,

538
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,643
orthogonal 90 degrees to each other.
You have to hold both of them in your 

539
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:31,940
head and be comfortable and understand 
that you need them both to get a full

540
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,770
sure thesis,
antithesis,

541
00:28:33,771 --> 00:28:36,320
synthesis.
There's another spiritual ideas

542
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,340
contradictory and you have to do it in,
in understanding quantum mechanics,

543
00:28:40,341 --> 00:28:44,480
and that's the great thing because 
nature forces you to think like that,

544
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,760
so it's no longer optional animas key 
point,

545
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,490
yes,
so you're trained,

546
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,870
you're forced to think in that way,
and that's very valuable.

547
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,410
Yes,
but also say Brian,

548
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,283
that the way that semantics and these 
systems of taxonomy actually operate is 

549
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:07,210
a word like freedom is determined by the
powerful.

550
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,020
So freedom ultimately becomes in where 
we can say in our society,

551
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,610
freedom within limits,
and ultimately freedom to consume,

552
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,840
freedom to behave in accordance with 
these ideologies.

553
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:20,674
This is what freedom means.
When political figures talk about they 

554
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:25,580
hate our freedoms or they're attacking 
our freedoms,

555
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:26,643
wha wha.
What they mean by freedom is often 

556
00:29:28,091 --> 00:29:33,091
indicated by the maxims they spout.
When in crises,

557
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:34,564
Eg go out and shop after nine slash 11 
or there is no such thing as society 

558
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,703
from Margaret Thatcher.
These like these sort of a momentary 

559
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:49,510
fishes with ever fruit,
which we can glance what they mean.

560
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,400
What is the state,
what it,

561
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,313
what is their truth?
Because like we were discussing earlier 

562
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:58,240
in my summer intentionally to aft radio 
show.

563
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,700
Um,
the,

564
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:02,290
um.
Oh God,

565
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:03,460
no,
I forgot what I was saying there.

566
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,500
Sometimes I'll come.
I was operating on a level that was.

567
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,450
Wow.
Well you said that you've given examples

568
00:30:08,451 --> 00:30:13,070
of people who are convinced that they 
are right now is the point.

569
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:13,761
Yeah.
Certainty.

570
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:16,370
You said beware of people that are 
served and I think that,

571
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,840
you know,
we're really,

572
00:30:17,841 --> 00:30:19,940
if you think about what a free society 
is,

573
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,350
that it means that there's a spectrum of
viewpoints on every issue.

574
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,543
And so you can imagine,
I'd call it a distribution with the 

575
00:30:28,251 --> 00:30:30,560
mathematics recall the tails of the 
distribution,

576
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:31,394
which are the bits at the end.
So most people might believe this stuff 

577
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:35,840
in the middle,
but there are people on either side that

578
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:38,660
believe other things.
And if you have to,

579
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:39,494
by definition in a free society,
find yourself occasionally at odds with 

580
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:45,290
the majority.
That is a signal that you live in a free

581
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:46,124
society and you should celebrate it.
And I think that the key lesson for me 

582
00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:51,134
from,
from just thinking rather more 

583
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,943
scientifically about things,
is that is to understand that when you 

584
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:58,910
find yourselves in disagreement with 
other people,

585
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,670
it is.

586
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,503
It is a signal of a healthy democracy in
a healthy society and you should 

587
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:07,400
celebrate every time you find you're an 
outlier.

588
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,790
You should be waving a flag.
You shouldn't be running down the street

589
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:13,160
cheering going,
I don't live in North Korea.

590
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,040
That's what you should be.
And that has been lost.

591
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:16,874
You do live in North Korea.
Which case don't run down the flag if 

592
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,090
you're listening to this,
should not create.

593
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,420
But I think we've lost that.
You see on Yammer,

594
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,263
we both,
we're both on twitter and we see that 

595
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,540
the polarization of debates means that 
people are just not thinking.

596
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:33,374
They're not stopping and thinking the 
fact that this person is saying 

597
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:40,580
something with which I disagree,
signals to me that our societies healthy

598
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,623
and the moment that nobody's saying 
things that I disagree with is the 

599
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:48,410
moment you should actually then you 
should leave the country and run.

600
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,553
Don't you think that what we're 
witnessing now is the time of 

601
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,603
foreclosure around discourse,
that more and more things are becoming 

602
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:57,234
to booth,
that there's a reemergence of censure 

603
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,670
and the Internet,
as you just indicated,

604
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,980
is a very good example of that.
These are the things that are unsayable.

605
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,980
Furthermore,
don't you think that the art,

606
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,780
we have to say that there are 
ideologies.

607
00:32:09,781 --> 00:32:12,810
Ideals are being said.
There is such a thing as power.

608
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:13,644
We're not living in a society that's 
constantly fluctuating and according to 

609
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:17,124
the will of the majority,
were living in a democracy where the 

610
00:32:19,201 --> 00:32:20,034
function of democracy is to limit the 
capacity of people to impact its 

611
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:24,624
objectives.
And the one of the problems of 

612
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,630
globalization is that it has meant the 
establishment of a.

613
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,740
they're not subject to sort of national,
any kind of a regional law by.

614
00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:36,780
They seem to live in a kind of what I 
would say,

615
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,300
a sort of a rarefied protected space

616
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,970
that and what you've seen with the 
brexit votes and I,

617
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:46,350
I don't think it's the right route at 
all.

618
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:46,861
I mean,
I,

619
00:32:46,861 --> 00:32:50,670
I think I'm a great fan of the European 
Union.

620
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:53,670
However,
what you've seen with the brexit vote is

621
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:58,210
extremely positive in the sense you're 
talking because what you've seen is a,

622
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,053
a statement by the majority of people in
the country that they reject the status 

623
00:33:02,341 --> 00:33:03,174
quo.
Sure.

624
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,750
And I think they have done it.
They have rejected the status quo.

625
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:07,803
A prime minister resigned.
There's now a absolute flux in politics 

626
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:13,640
and,
and so I think that we.

627
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,980
Brian,
I think we have to note two things here.

628
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,570
One,
it's a massive anomaly.

629
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,310
It doesn't happen very often.
Stuff like brexit.

630
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:23,050
That's why everyone's wearing themselves
and all giggly and excited about that.

631
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,990
Brexit in itself was an emotional 
reaction or rational reaction.

632
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:31,370
People won't go more because I want to 
see these trade laws or emotions,

633
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:35,810
but it showed you that the status quo 
can be overturned in a democracy because

634
00:33:35,811 --> 00:33:37,170
at the moment we don't have this.

635
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,360
I would say within certain guidelines,
I don't think,

636
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:41,194
you know,
when's the vote for now we're going to 

637
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:44,320
tax corporations at this rate.
Now we're going to,

638
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:44,920
oh,
uh,

639
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,160
this is how we want to pay mortgages.
This is how we want our societies.

640
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,820
You can argue that it may be that we 
see,

641
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,100
for example,
Jeremy Corbyn is prime minister,

642
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:59,110
which would have been absolutely 
unthinkable and two years ago,

643
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,130
and if he does become prime industry 
will be as a result of the brexit vote,

644
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:08,310
that that will be the route that a more 
radical politician managed it.

645
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,560
That's how a radical politician will 
have got into number 10.

646
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,320
Now,
I,

647
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,980
I,
I'm,

648
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,590
I'm,
I,

649
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,080
I think brexit is a mistake because I 
think that it,

650
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,480
that the people that voted to,
uh,

651
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,563
to challenge the status quo are going to
suffer the most from this and the 

652
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,970
removal of the freedoms that we have to 
move around Europe.

653
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,873
Europe,
the removable of access to single 

654
00:34:30,011 --> 00:34:30,671
market,
I was thinking,

655
00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:32,920
so I think actually it's the wrong 
solution.

656
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,993
Possibly,
unless they are interested in 

657
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:38,460
democratically that it can.
It can

658
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,403
still happen unless it does lead to a 
left wing government who use it as an 

659
00:34:41,571 --> 00:34:42,404
opportunity to create new legislation 
around the behavior of transnational 

660
00:34:45,111 --> 00:34:46,930
corporations,
different taxation or something.

661
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:47,764
Hey,
you know there is.

662
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,810
I was talking to someone in here 
recently about like a possible left wing

663
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,470
outcome for Europe.
I don't.

664
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,313
We dragged down at bloody brexit 
quagmire when a man who understands the 

665
00:34:55,941 --> 00:34:59,090
bleeding.
I didn't plan to talk about that,

666
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:00,920
but I think it's a good demonstration

667
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,153
what you're talking about it you could 
see as a healthy attack on the status 

668
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:06,411
quo.
You could say,

669
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:08,310
I don't think it'll have that result,
but

670
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,583
no,
I mean the fact that it's an anomaly is 

671
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:16,040
what concerns me and the fact that we 
lower the threshold of what's acceptable

672
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:18,530
for democracy.
We've got democracy once in a while.

673
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:22,340
We can have a Miss God.
Misguided carnival of disruption instead

674
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:23,174
of democracy is why don't we control our
communities and controlled so that the 

675
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:30,710
most vulnerable people have access to 
power.

676
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,450
That's democracy.
If it's not,

677
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:33,284
that is not democracy is a piece of 
theater and like I don't settle for 

678
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:38,080
that.
Do you remember like

679
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,800
because of you and I,
we talked a little bit about because you

680
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:41,634
were very keen to encourage young people
to a point where I was saying it's 

681
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,490
pointless and like it was a sort of an 
intern because I,

682
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:50,910
I sense that you and I have a lot more 
in common ideologically.

683
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:51,744
Then we have the separation even though 
you are a scientist and I'm a religious 

684
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:55,164
maniac and you often pro democracy and 
I'm proud mass decentralization and 

685
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:02,010
disillusion of power where possible,
you know,

686
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,993
but I feel that we're both driven by the
idea that we're essentially optimistic 

687
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,180
is what I would say about you.
You seem like an optimistic man.

688
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,030
Yeah,
and you have to be.

689
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,550
Because we go back to what we were 
talking about earlier about the value of

690
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:18,930
this place,
the earth and I think one of the.

691
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,160
If I could,
if there's one message that I would like

692
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:23,994
people to take away from anything that I
do is to is to value this place and 

693
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:27,770
it's.

694
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,920
That's not some kind of like a sort of 
hippy type thing.

695
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,870
Is it just based on the observation,
the,

696
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:35,900
the,
the,

697
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,940
the complexity of life on earth?
It may well be.

698
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:44,790
It may make us quite a unit.
We can be unique in a galaxy,

699
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,050
for example.
I don't think.

700
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,860
I'm sure there'll be other civilizations
out there in the billions of galaxies in

701
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:53,400
the universe,
but it could be that the average is that

702
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:57,030
there's about roughly one civilizations 
per galaxy at any one time,

703
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,103
and imagine that Arthur c Clarke once 
famously said that there are two 

704
00:37:00,691 --> 00:37:03,950
options.
Either we are alone or we're not in both

705
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:04,784
a terrifying,
but I think we need to proceed on the 

706
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:12,210
basis that we are now an imagine.
If people thought about that,

707
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,073
which is just a matter of perspective.
If people thought actually that if we 

708
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,663
decided to have a nuclear war tomorrow 
accidentally perhaps and destroyed 

709
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,200
intelligent life on the planets,
it may be that we destroy meaning in the

710
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:32,110
galaxy and meaning I use advisedly 
because if you think about it,

711
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,820
meaning obviously exists in the universe
because it means something to us,

712
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
so there are collections of atoms that 
somehow of of the property of meaning as

713
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:42,900
emerged.

714
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,120
It means something to us.
If we go,

715
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,790
then there will be no meaning in this 
corner of the university.

716
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:49,763
Meaning is local and it's temporary and 
I think accepting that but by which I 

717
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:54,954
mean it it had in your head,
but when I say I think it's global way 

718
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,493
though,
in a way it's irrelevant whether there 

719
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:03,240
are other civilizations or this one's 
unique in empirically.

720
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,170
I mean it's up to us.
It doesn't matter.

721
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:06,860
I like it.
Even life is beautiful.

722
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,733
Life is beautiful.
Whether or not someone's over there 

723
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:09,864
having a beautiful time,
to me sort of irrelevant and also terms 

724
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,943
such as local and ton portal,
a highly subjective terms as we have 

725
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:17,964
already established that refer to 
patterns themselves that exist within a 

726
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:24,810
context and our consciousness relates 
only to that context,

727
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,810
so the meaning that emerge.
Is it like,

728
00:38:27,811 --> 00:38:28,644
you know,
whatever this thing is that transition 

729
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:32,760
from online to live for various 
gradients,

730
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:33,594
geological to biological,
whatever proceeded and whatever follows 

731
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:40,180
that meaning is one of its components.

732
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,210
It's.
It exists as organically as trees.

733
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,880
Yeah.
Well physicists are.

734
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:50,590
Some scientists refer to as an emergent 
property which is something that emerges

735
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:51,424
from some more fundamental structure and
then this is probably the difference 

736
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:54,814
between us.
I ask you a question because because I 

737
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:57,304
think that the great challenge of human 
existence is to come to terms with the 

738
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:04,600
fact that the meaning exists,
but it is,

739
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,793
as I said,
it's local in the sense that it's not 

740
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:10,180
universal and I think that's the 
difference.

741
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,014
If I was to define the difference 
between a religious person or a non 

742
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,430
religious,
I would say that it's a question to you,

743
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:19,660
but I would say that religion is 
searching for global meaning and I think

744
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:20,494
it's local and I think there will come a
time in the life of the universe when 

745
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:24,184
there is no meaning left because I think
that as far as they were approaching it 

746
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,520
won't mean.

747
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,350
I think that's what I think though.
That's my truck.

748
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:30,184
That's precisely the problem is that 
material materialism and rationalism 

749
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:34,930
lead to individualism,
capitalism and consumerism.

750
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:39,490
We can see in real time what it leads to
politically and socially.

751
00:39:39,491 --> 00:39:40,324
I mean more brutal than that though.
I mean the in the far future of the 

752
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:45,250
universe.
There won't be any sons left shining,

753
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,940
so there won't be any atoms that can 
contemplate at of course the universe.

754
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,930
I understand that and that is an 
enormous thing to say,

755
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:57,010
Brian and and I've got absolutely no 
bloody kit to argue with prince.

756
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,670
What does it mean to you?
You actually graduate.

757
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,040
What does it.
What do you feel like?

758
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:05,041
If I say there will come a time in the 
future when there is no consciousness in

759
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:09,730
the universe and so,
so all possibility of meaning has gone,

760
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,080
but the universe will still be there.

761
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,063
I would say that within my philosophy,
consciousness and matter have the 

762
00:40:17,771 --> 00:40:20,200
reverse relationship too.
In yours.

763
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:23,500
I believe that emerges from 
consciousness,

764
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,603
not vice versa,
so even where the astrophysical context 

765
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,170
or in evolves.
As you know,

766
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,940
brilliant men such as yourself and your 
predecessors have demonstrated that will

767
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:34,774
happen.
That to me is essentially irrelevant 

768
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,210
because it's just part of the cosmic 
ballet.

769
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,270
Continuing within the framework of 
consciousness,

770
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:47,050
and I underwrite this of course,
speculative lake,

771
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:47,943
like all theories that are that bookend 
creation it speculative as anybody 

772
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:56,020
else's,
but for me in the proceeding,

773
00:40:56,021 --> 00:41:00,070
the Big Bang there is consciousness 
consciousness that is not individualized

774
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:00,904
consciousness.
There's no expressed through matter and 

775
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:03,214
this is not something that I would 
narrativize or used to underwrite or 

776
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:06,634
support any particular ideology.
It's not like in our consciousness for 

777
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:11,710
white people or a consciousness for 
Muslims,

778
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:16,860
pure consciousness expressing itself 
through Mata and that these patterns and

779
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:19,660
habits that are so beautifully 
delineated,

780
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:20,494
these rules that discovered with these 
rules that Herman Melville describes as 

781
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,753
all human sciences,
but passing fables as we discover what 

782
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:29,134
lies beyond them,
like these are an expression of this 

783
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,160
consciousness,
so when eventually whatever

784
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,700
it is that exist instead of human beings
are consumed by the sun,

785
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:41,540
that doesn't matter to me because 
individuation I believe is temporal.

786
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,670
The I am just part of a whole 
consciousness temporarily occupying this

787
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:48,320
individual or I can't put it any better 
than Bill Hicks.

788
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:53,330
We are one consciousness experiencing 
itself subjectively and I would say that

789
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:57,920
the reason that geology becomes biology 
is because the geology is conscious.

790
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:01,470
That consciousness is in all things and 
the reason that we should love nature.

791
00:42:01,471 --> 00:42:02,304
I love the earth and love one another is
because we are all one and there are 

792
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:10,040
motifs for this through our culture.
Why are we moved by heroism?

793
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,490
Because a person's sacrificing 
themselves for another why?

794
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:14,324
Because they know inadvertent commerce 
on some deeper level that there is no 

795
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:22,370
distinction between self and other.
This is mainly the greed of the senses,

796
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,560
dealing with physical information.

797
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,350
The experience are receives.
This is inside,

798
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,213
this is outside,
but ultimately in essentially those 

799
00:42:30,021 --> 00:42:34,400
distinctions are animalistic attempts to
understand limitless phenomena.

800
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:39,020
So that's why it doesn't matter to me.
Although I would say like you,

801
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:43,100
we have to regard these thing with love 
because love in a very Christian sense,

802
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:44,480
actually let's.
Cs Lewis says,

803
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,553
you feel like you're rewarded when you 
do a good thing and when you do a bad 

804
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:49,640
thing,
you know that was bad,

805
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,490
so let's just go with that.
Be kind to one another.

806
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:53,324
Love one another.
Let people believe what they want to 

807
00:42:54,561 --> 00:42:55,990
believe.
So mine comes from that.

808
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,133
I'm not ashamed of the bits that sounded
a bit hippy because for me love is an 

809
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:01,130
energy.
Love is a force,

810
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:03,710
and whilst it's difficult to quantify 
and measure without it,

811
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:04,544
we are nothing.
I think

812
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:09,660
the only thing,
my view is it certainly bleaker,

813
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,550
right?
Pointing,

814
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,790
well,
but I think that actually the road see,

815
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:16,983
I would say that the road to wisdom is 
is the most challenging question that I 

816
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:24,934
face given the I'm saying that matter 
and energy in the laws of nature exist 

817
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:30,843
and then life emerges from them and then
they will come and sign when there's no 

818
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:39,241
life so that that challenges you to say 
what is the value then of life and given

819
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:45,841
that it is temporary and this emerges 
and it will go away again and it will be

820
00:43:45,911 --> 00:43:50,911
time when the universe is dark and there
is nothing left and I think that you get

821
00:43:50,951 --> 00:43:51,784
some sort of delight from what I did 
because I think in the sense that the 

822
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,063
the piece is a human being I think comes
from finding your accommodation with 

823
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:10,411
your temporary existence and I'm 
learning that it's so.

824
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,283
The temporary nature of it to me makes 
it more valuable is a fine as a tiny 

825
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:19,630
amount of time is nothing in the light 
of the universe.

826
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:20,683
A tiny amount of time when we not only 
individually but as a human race can 

827
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:25,564
exist and explore and love the universe.
It's a finite tiny amount of time and I 

828
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:32,040
think

829
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,220
that's a much more difficult 
accommodation to come to it,

830
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,093
but I think that's really.
I think that's what reality is and so 

831
00:44:41,071 --> 00:44:45,240
we've got to come to accommodation with,
but I think in that accommodation is the

832
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:46,074
way you learn to love the planets and 
the people on it because you learned 

833
00:44:49,371 --> 00:44:51,280
that they are temporary and valuable and
franchise.

834
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,640
As long as it leads to that conclusion.
It sort of doesn't really matter.

835
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,480
But what we'll say is we've.
We've already acknowledged in the,

836
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:57,683
in this brief interview that our 
understanding of the temporal framework 

837
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:05,250
and the spatial framework of sort of 
breaking down the more we examined them,

838
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,203
so why would we continue to use that 
framework to conjecture billions of 

839
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,490
years in the future when it's breaking 
down?

840
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:14,100
Right now I'm in.
The way we do it by the way,

841
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:17,280
is to get to say it's a thing called a 
freedom in equation,

842
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,970
which comes from general relativity from
Einstein's theory Republican in Nineteen

843
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:21,804
15.

844
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:22,773
And what Einstein's theory tells us is 
that there is a a given thing which is 

845
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,310
the fabric of the universe.
It's called space time.

846
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,490
So there's a thing and it doesn't tell 
you where it came from,

847
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:33,324
it tells you there is such a thing,
but it does tell you how that thing 

848
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:37,404
stretches and warps and deforms and 
changes in response to the matter and 

849
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:43,860
energy that are present in the 
university.

850
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:44,903
So you can calculate,
given this amount of matter in this 

851
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:51,170
amount of radiation and dark matter and 
dark energy.

852
00:45:51,171 --> 00:45:52,830
Now I've given all that stuff.
Now,

853
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,113
what will it do in the future?
What is the response of the fabric of 

854
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:57,294
the universe to this stuff?
And that's what enables us to say with 

855
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,670
some confidence that unless the new 
physics that we don't understand it,

856
00:46:03,671 --> 00:46:05,820
there might be,
but given what we know now,

857
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,790
the university is accelerating in its 
expansion,

858
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:12,600
which we observe and he will come to a 
point where we think it will just double

859
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:16,680
continually in size every 20 billion 
years or so forever.

860
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,920
And we can make that prediction given 
what we know now.

861
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:20,963
So there is,
that's the baseline sort of baseline 

862
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:23,634
prediction is we are in the universe 
that will end up in what's called an 

863
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:26,874
exponential expansion,
doubling in size every 20 billion years 

864
00:46:29,191 --> 00:46:34,191
or so for ever because life cannot exist
indefinitely in such a universe,

865
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:35,903
of course not,
but that's not necessarily a linear 

866
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,440
equation.
And reality may be fractal,

867
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:41,303
maybe spiral right at the basis of that 
Theorem is the acceptance and we don't 

868
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,534
know where it comes from,
where it's going and it infers that 

869
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:48,151
it's,
you know,

870
00:46:48,151 --> 00:46:51,550
as I know you've talked about a lot in 
your programs is expanding into apparent

871
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,690
nothingness.
But then you see that our linguistic and

872
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:55,524
indeed psychological tools and 
neurological thoughts I would imagine 

873
00:46:58,111 --> 00:47:00,630
from your perspective,
start to break down.

874
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:05,660
And so this is again where I sort of our
invite sort of faith say one thing.

875
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,153
It is a theory that is tested.
So is the theory that allows us to 

876
00:47:10,471 --> 00:47:11,310
build,
for example,

877
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:12,144
the satellite navigation system.
So quite I'm not having a go at bloody 

878
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:19,110
Einstein or satellite navigation.
It does work within,

879
00:47:19,111 --> 00:47:20,120
but it's a model.
But.

880
00:47:20,121 --> 00:47:20,954
But Brian,
when you say satellite navigation 

881
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:23,850
systems are fast,
fantastic,

882
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:24,684
though they are,
these are not tools that we're going to 

883
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:30,190
use to measure the expanse of a dabbling

884
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,023
in millions of years.
This is a localized bit of information 

885
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,380
that applies to us as corn or beans.

886
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:40,890
Just a quick explanation of how we know 
it's expanding.

887
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,753
Oh,
is is simple observation that if you 

888
00:47:43,891 --> 00:47:44,724
look at the light from a distant galaxy 
and then you find that it stretched so 

889
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:50,970
quite literally mean the color changed.
It's called red shift.

890
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,450
So it's a lie as a wavelength and the 
long wave.

891
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:56,850
So rather than the short wave lengths 
are blue and what you find is light that

892
00:47:56,851 --> 00:47:57,684
should have been blue because you see it
coming from a particular kind of answer 

893
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:00,773
in that galaxy is actually now red.
And the explanation is that space has 

894
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:07,350
been stretching during the time the 
light has been traveling.

895
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,930
And what you find is the further the 
galaxy is away,

896
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,030
the more delight you're stretched.
We should exactly what you'd expect.

897
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,873
If you live in an expanding universe and
by making those measurements she can 

898
00:48:16,651 --> 00:48:17,484
measure how fast the universe has been 
expanding over billions of years and 

899
00:48:20,371 --> 00:48:21,204
then this is a sim,

900
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:23,663
no one could refute it and it's 
absolutely beautiful and I only I know 

901
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,944
that already and the reason I know who 
it is because I've watched you explain 

902
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:33,400
it elegantly and in a way that makes 
sense to me and is meaningful to me,

903
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,340
but what I would add to that is we see 
red,

904
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,313
we see blue.
We somehow within our minds experience 

905
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:43,450
rate,
we experienced blue,

906
00:48:43,451 --> 00:48:45,700
we have eyes,
we have senses.

907
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:46,534
We live in this realm where something is
experiencing something and like you 

908
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,020
said,
atoms experiencing other atoms.

909
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:53,854
Now what we have to continually 
acknowledges that there is a finite 

910
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,664
ability to understand information.
There is evidently limitless 

911
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:00,964
information.
At some point we're going to hit a wall 

912
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,083
and you know,
continue the war and what exists beyond 

913
00:49:06,491 --> 00:49:07,800
that,
his theories,

914
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,060
conjecture,
imagination,

915
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:13,720
and it's curious to me that is steeped 
in our theological history.

916
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:17,800
There were people speculating in similar
ways and reaching similar conclusions.

917
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:21,220
Of course,
no one can accurately say that's because

918
00:49:21,221 --> 00:49:22,054
space is stretching,
so you experienced read is different 

919
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:24,424
because why you've traveled different 
for the different density of spite and 

920
00:49:25,931 --> 00:49:30,670
people aren't saying stuff like that,
but people are speculating and trying to

921
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:33,730
understand the phenomena of 
limitlessness

922
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:34,710
reminded me.
Yeah,

923
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,800
and you remind about something you said 
earlier site which is this,

924
00:49:37,801 --> 00:49:40,790
which is the.
So I would say that I would.

925
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:46,970
I would disagree with you in a sense in 
that the finding out the way that nature

926
00:49:47,761 --> 00:49:48,594
works,
I think is the is is is only done 

927
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,610
through what we might loosely call the 
scientific method,

928
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:57,503
right?
Which is which is making observations 

929
00:49:58,981 --> 00:50:01,290
and building theories and checking them.
However,

930
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:06,960
it's not surprising to me that someone 
had a thought a few thousand years ago,

931
00:50:06,961 --> 00:50:10,470
which turns out to be in accord with 
what we discover.

932
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,203
Where I would disagree is I don't think 
that they had those thoughts by some 

933
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:19,760
royal road to the truth or something.
I don't think that.

934
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,000
I think that they.
So let's say these.

935
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:27,350
You say in some context a religious 
context or theological context.

936
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:28,220
Few thousand years ago,

937
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,520
we think for the sake of argument in the
Koran,

938
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:35,030
no,
put it back in that gates of Ellis Larry

939
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,600
say we say we think that we live in an 
expanding universe.

940
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:41,840
So we think there's points of light in 
the sky or other worlds as,

941
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,913
as people did say,
and we think they're all rushing away 

942
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:47,030
from each from us.
Right?

943
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:47,864
And then,
uh,

944
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:49,063
so,
well,

945
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,660
certainly for the galaxies,
this is true.

946
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:55,010
So the fact that someone said that it's 
something you could imagine saying,

947
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:58,100
you can imagine looking at those points 
of light in dreaming,

948
00:50:58,101 --> 00:51:01,700
that there are other worlds.
And actually Giordano Bruno famously did

949
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:05,900
that and got burned at the stake in Rome
in and his ashes thrown into the Tiber.

950
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:06,734
I think as part of the new year's 
celebrations that could very well that 

951
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,890
grow and expand across the Tiber 
limitless particles because he said that

952
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,710
he said,
I think these are the worlds and,

953
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,760
and wells without end limitless.

954
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,650
And now he had no reason to say that.
It was pure thought,

955
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:22,933
but it's something that you could 
imagine someone saying very politically 

956
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:26,750
now.
It turned out to be right,

957
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,570
but I don't think that.
I think the fact that he was right,

958
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:30,404
it was coincidental.
I don't think he had some path route to 

959
00:51:33,981 --> 00:51:36,860
knowledge through meditation.
The other thing,

960
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:40,100
there is a route to knowledge of nature 
through meditation.

961
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:44,390
There may well be.
I'm sure there is a route to inner peace

962
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:47,360
and a better understanding of yourself 
and your relationship with nature,

963
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:51,850
but I would.
I do not think that you can find out a.

964
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,040
You could build new physical theories 
by,

965
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,840
by meditating,
by,

966
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:59,890
by meditating alone.
Everybody thinking.

967
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:04,970
I mean I have to just crap when someone 
has a flash of intuition or inspiration,

968
00:52:05,061 --> 00:52:05,894
all these things and all this 
inflammation is entering the world 

969
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:11,000
through people's consciousness check it 
is by doing science.

970
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,240
Definitely check it through science yet 
and I was just dreaming about something.

971
00:52:14,241 --> 00:52:17,180
I refuse to check it and that is wrong.
That sort of like,

972
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:18,014
you know,
like I think from whatever angle you 

973
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:21,740
approach it,
when you get into Dogma and doctrine and

974
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:24,260
telling people what to do and what they 
can be and what they can't be.

975
00:52:24,261 --> 00:52:27,590
I think you get into really dicey 
territory from my perspective,

976
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:32,090
where the bias is is has gone towards 
sort of science,

977
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:35,390
particularly economics and particularly 
political science.

978
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:36,463
Like what I'll watch your programs,
I'll watch you talk about the way that 

979
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:42,360
was is behaving and pebbles in lakes and
the life of strawberries of me.

980
00:52:42,361 --> 00:52:43,194
This is awesome and beautiful and 
glorious and precisely what we need to 

981
00:52:46,971 --> 00:52:47,804
examine and track,
but what I feel is is somehow the same 

982
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:51,720
way as the,
you know,

983
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,800
one could say the philosophy of Christ 
was used to underwrite a great big,

984
00:52:57,111 --> 00:53:00,020
powerful economic institution that ends 
up saying,

985
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:00,883
don't put back there.
It will revisit v people for Anatomy is 

986
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,173
you know,
the people use science to say don't 

987
00:53:06,381 --> 00:53:09,640
think that live there a bay these rules,
and this is this.

988
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,573
You're right,
that this is entirely wrong because 

989
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:17,081
science science is a body of knowledge.
It doesn't tell you anything really.

990
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,180
It doesn't tell you anything about how 
to,

991
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:21,523
what to make of that knowledge.
And when it can tell you there are 2 

992
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,190
trillion in the observable

993
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,510
universe,
full stop.

994
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:30,090
It doesn't tell you what that means,
right?

995
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:32,550
What,
what do you to make it that doesn't tell

996
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:33,384
you it's the same with,
and we're going to go back to 

997
00:53:35,551 --> 00:53:37,050
oppenheimer,
you know,

998
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:42,120
the idea that so you can build an atomic
bomb and science tells you,

999
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:45,660
it gives you the knowledge so that you 
can build an atomic bomb.

1000
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:49,070
It certainly does not tell you what to 
do with it right now.

1001
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:49,923
I mean,
actually we would argue that common 

1002
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:55,800
sense tells you not to use it.
Don't press that button.

1003
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:56,760
It's.
But um,

1004
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,090
so I think that's a key point.
So for me,

1005
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:00,810
the,
the,

1006
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:04,710
the proper interaction between science 
and religion and philosophy and theology

1007
00:54:04,711 --> 00:54:05,544
and art and music and literature.
All this data is that they go together 

1008
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:14,210
to allow us to build a,
a view of what our place in the universe

1009
00:54:15,621 --> 00:54:17,250
is and what it means to be human.

1010
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,750
None of them on the own will allow you 
to build that idea,

1011
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,630
to come to that conclusion.
What does it mean to be human?

1012
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,990
But you need them all for so beautiful,
isn't it?

1013
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:29,760
Thesis,
antithesis,

1014
00:54:29,761 --> 00:54:31,890
synthesis that you have to come 
together.

1015
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,620
And that means that one of the things 
that you've mentioned a lot,

1016
00:54:34,621 --> 00:54:35,454
Bryan,
is humility that that there needs to be 

1017
00:54:37,531 --> 00:54:40,620
humility in all these communities and in
a sense,

1018
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,360
an idea of an objective,
like you said,

1019
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:46,380
about sort of a with the libertarianism 
ultimate individualism,

1020
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:50,340
communism,
so of aversion of the subjugation of the

1021
00:54:50,341 --> 00:54:52,800
individual in favor of the state.
We have to,

1022
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,753
in order to build systems,
human systems that make sense to us is 

1023
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,350
going to need to be a collaboration 
between science,

1024
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,360
spirituality,
our theology,

1025
00:55:03,361 --> 00:55:05,460
and all these taxonomies are 
interchangeable.

1026
00:55:05,461 --> 00:55:08,610
Because one man spirituality is another 
man's science night.

1027
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:13,170
I recognize that what you're saying is 
on the bandwidth of material energy that

1028
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:14,760
can be measured,
magnified,

1029
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:16,110
shrunk,
weighed out,

1030
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,190
double blind,
tested.

1031
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:21,390
There are certain things that we can say
on this plane of factual at this time,

1032
00:55:21,391 --> 00:55:22,860
at this moment,
on this level.

1033
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,413
I think the crisis that we're going 
through at the moment that a 

1034
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:28,140
civilization is.
We don't have a point.

1035
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:32,900
There isn't a meaning to our 
civilization and I just made a program a

1036
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,083
while ago about commercial spaceflight 
until it's people like Elon Musk and 

1037
00:55:36,721 --> 00:55:37,554
Jeff Bezos and the these entrepreneurs 
who were trying to go out beyond the 

1038
00:55:41,491 --> 00:55:45,210
earth and they all share a philosophy,
a certain philosophy,

1039
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:46,044
which is that humanity,
if you're looking for meaning what 

1040
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:49,980
drives us,
we need frontiers,

1041
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,083
frontiers of knowledge there,
which you might call intellectual or 

1042
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:56,670
spiritual frontiers and physical from 
tears.

1043
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,713
We need somewhere to go.
Carl Sagan once said that somewhere out 

1044
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:02,130
there,
there's something waiting to be known in

1045
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:03,003
her.
Beautiful.

1046
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:03,990
And uh,
so,

1047
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:04,940
so we,
we,

1048
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:05,823
we don't have that on the earth anymore.
There are no frontiers rather obviously 

1049
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,833
both political borders,
but there are no places that we haven't 

1050
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:14,610
been.
There's no wild west push into.

1051
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:19,790
And so they think that the next step to 
go out upwards to the stars to step onto

1052
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,950
the moon and to Mars.
And beyond that,

1053
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,190
the place where

1054
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,350
our,
where we will find meaning again.

1055
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,030
Well I hope possibly there.
Right?

1056
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:28,864
And it's certainly very intrepid,
but I would query the idea that we are 

1057
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:32,794
without frontiers because there are 
certain ideological and physical spaces 

1058
00:56:36,191 --> 00:56:40,360
that we have not tried to access.
We have not here on what value is it?

1059
00:56:40,361 --> 00:56:42,760
If we start building new societies on 
Mars,

1060
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:46,000
if down here on bloody earth,
we're treating each other appallingly.

1061
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:47,043
There are basic principles that have 
found their way into common 

1062
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:51,850
consciousness,
mostly for spirituality with long,

1063
00:56:51,851 --> 00:56:52,684
long,
long before monotheism pantheistic 

1064
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:55,923
cultures.
All find versions of look after one 

1065
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,014
another.
That's not to say there isn't a you and 

1066
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,340
you would know much more than me,
kind of brutality in nature,

1067
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:07,420
whether it's zoology or astronomy,
there's a brutality and a finality,

1068
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,960
but are these the principles that we 
want to be governed by human beings?

1069
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,003
For the frontiers,
I would be interested in traversing and 

1070
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:18,730
heading toward a quality love new 
systems that give us,

1071
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:19,564
once again a vision so that the 
exploration of space becomes valid but 

1072
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:25,900
not once again,
the pursuit of economic power,

1073
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:28,660
the pursue of dominions,
dominions new.

1074
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,790
We've conquered and subjugated mother 
earth.

1075
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:32,680
They see what other planets we can fuck 
up.

1076
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:34,663
One of the,
one of the ideas is that how do you 

1077
00:57:36,551 --> 00:57:38,870
develop new political systems?
So if you look at,

1078
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,100
for example,
the uh,

1079
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:41,221
America,
so,

1080
00:57:41,221 --> 00:57:41,781
so the,
the,

1081
00:57:41,781 --> 00:57:42,320
the,
the,

1082
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,153
the movement from Europe into America 
and that ended up with the American 

1083
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:49,020
constitution.
And so there,

1084
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:54,060
there are obviously there were pros and 
cons of this steady Brian Slavery,

1085
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,393
but you got to sign,
one of the things you got was this 

1086
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:02,890
document which I think is widely 
recognized as one of the,

1087
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:03,650
the,
the,

1088
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:06,490
the most important statements of how you
might send nice poems,

1089
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:08,770
but if it doesn't relate to the way you 
run a society,

1090
00:58:08,771 --> 00:58:09,604
then what value is it?
And this is precisely the problem now 

1091
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,120
which is not put it into practice if you
grow.

1092
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,970
And even then Brian,
it was except for these people,

1093
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:17,920
you know,
except for women except for these people

1094
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:18,754
that live here already.

1095
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,693
But the point is that no,
this certainly there is a relationship 

1096
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:24,100
between the physical and the spiritual.
The,

1097
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:24,934
if we grow into new territory is 
physically there is a possibility that 

1098
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:30,100
will somehow help us to discover within 
ourselves new notions.

1099
00:58:30,101 --> 00:58:32,130
But like we can do that without getting 
on a spaceship,

1100
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:32,973
we could just start saying that's not 
judge people couldn't what they look 

1101
00:58:34,781 --> 00:58:35,614
like or some of the ideas is that our 
system on this planet now it's become 

1102
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:40,950
quite ossified.
What's that mean?

1103
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:45,580
Not Fossil and locked in.
Whereas if you go to,

1104
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:46,923
if you imagine that in a hundred years' 
time or something we have the Mars 

1105
00:58:50,141 --> 00:58:50,974
colony is,
is looking to become independent and 

1106
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,233
the,
the,

1107
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:53,980
the,
the,

1108
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:54,813
the act of going to a new place and 
beginning again can allow you to access 

1109
00:58:59,171 --> 00:59:00,004
different ways of being in different 
ways of interacting that might not be 

1110
00:59:02,891 --> 00:59:06,640
possible here because of the historic 
borders and,

1111
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:08,910
and,
and problems they may have.

1112
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:09,743
I sort of agree,
but that doesn't make me want to get on 

1113
00:59:11,171 --> 00:59:13,570
a spaceship that makes people want to 
get on the barricade.

1114
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:14,613
It makes me want to change the world.
It makes me say if we've reached a sort 

1115
00:59:17,231 --> 00:59:20,230
of a point of crisis,
like for me it's not like,

1116
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:21,440
oh bloody hell,
let's go somewhere else.

1117
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:23,060
For me it's like we're going to have to 
change.

1118
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:28,670
You will know that the one area where 
science is not being allowed to a,

1119
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,430
not the one,
but I an area where science is not being

1120
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:35,300
allowed to inform the way we treat the 
planet is with climate change.

1121
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:37,670
People are not going right steady 
because for me,

1122
00:59:37,671 --> 00:59:39,200
one of the things I've learned over the 
course of this podcast,

1123
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:40,034
and I must say this,
one of the ones that have been like a 

1124
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:44,150
great big iceberg of inflammation,
smashing into my consciousness.

1125
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,713
Hopefully I can stay afloat,
unlikely every other vessel in that 

1126
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:48,920
analogy is that,
um,

1127
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:53,360
is the,
all our ideologies are caveated by.

1128
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:56,300
And as long as it doesn't affect the 
interest of the powerful,

1129
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,040
we must do something about climate 
change.

1130
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,200
As long as it doesn't affect the 
interest of the powerful,

1131
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:03,310
we must have says as long as it doesn't 
impact later.

1132
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,273
So for me,
it's about finding ways of impact the 

1133
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:07,034
interests of the powerful.
Until we are prepared to do that and to 

1134
01:00:09,921 --> 01:00:10,754
ever better address that frontier is no 
point in jumping on Elan Musk space 

1135
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:14,750
craft or saying,
yeah,

1136
01:00:14,751 --> 01:00:16,520
perhaps it is a virtual reality 
experiment.

1137
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,770
We have to start saying,
what is happening?

1138
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,750
These people are behaving in this way.
Right?

1139
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:21,584
Well,
that's got to be regulated and stopped 

1140
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:23,500
and stripped.
You're right.

1141
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,310
I mean,
interesting that Jeff Bezos,

1142
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:27,620
the Amazon Ceo,
who's got a company blue origin,

1143
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,690
and he said to me,
first of all,

1144
01:00:29,691 --> 01:00:31,070
why is this company called blue origin?

1145
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:34,610
Because it refers to the earth,
the blue origin of humanity,

1146
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:35,803
and he said that the one thing we've 
learned in our exploration of the solar 

1147
01:00:39,171 --> 01:00:41,870
system and beyond is that this planet is
the best one,

1148
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:43,490
right?
We've learned that number one,

1149
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:44,893
and that means that is a jewel.
He calls it a jewel of a planet and 

1150
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:50,360
therefore we must protect it.
At the same time,

1151
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:51,493
we have a large population which is 
making increase in depends on the 

1152
01:00:54,081 --> 01:00:56,330
resources.
So what is the solution?

1153
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,580
How do you support an expanding 
population,

1154
01:00:58,910 --> 01:00:59,743
all of whom want a better life for them 
and their children at the same time is 

1155
01:01:03,381 --> 01:01:04,214
protecting this beautiful blue planet.
The answer is to get the resources from 

1156
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,000
elsewhere.
That's the answer.

1157
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:11,723
Answer.
Another one would be to start 

1158
01:01:12,801 --> 01:01:16,400
prioritizing the health of the planet 
above economic needs.

1159
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,990
As long as you've got a capitalism,
uh,

1160
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:19,873
in the form,
it's now way in which many people would 

1161
01:01:20,691 --> 01:01:22,040
argue is way beyond capitalism.

1162
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:22,993
Then then it's inevitable.
And what Marx is critical theory that 

1163
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:29,940
the first discovery page one is this is 
a limited resource we are.

1164
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:33,590
It cannot provide limited growth.
So that's got to go there.

1165
01:01:33,591 --> 01:01:36,830
May well have a,
you can argue that you have a point in,

1166
01:01:36,831 --> 01:01:37,664
in Europe,
North America and the West that you 

1167
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:43,280
might call,
but if you talk about sub Saharan Africa

1168
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,173
or India or large parts of China,
than it is difficult to see how you can 

1169
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,740
lift those people out of poverty at the 
same time.

1170
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,673
That reducing the demand on the planet 
because those people are there and they 

1171
01:01:55,371 --> 01:01:56,204
live in poverty and it's right that they
aspire to a better life for their 

1172
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:00,330
children.
But the,

1173
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:02,450
the,
the answer can,

1174
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,400
can be innovation.
I mean,

1175
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:05,234
for example,
I was in China about two weeks ago and 

1176
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:12,050
they just canceled the building of 150 
coal fired power stations.

1177
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:12,983
Canceled it and the reason they 
cancelled it was because solar power is 

1178
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:18,520
cheaper,
so it was purely,

1179
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,433
it was partly market driven decision,
partly because they have a problem with 

1180
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:22,374
pollution in the cities,
but the point is the innovation has 

1181
01:02:25,261 --> 01:02:28,790
delivered a solution because solar power
makes no impact on the planet.

1182
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:29,624
It's too shuffle.
So like once you know that wisdom is 

1183
01:02:32,101 --> 01:02:33,470
acting on knowledge,
once we have that,

1184
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,510
the facts just in the next thing should 
be around a phone calls like,

1185
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,470
Hey,
guess what?

1186
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,560
Now solar power only as quickly as 
possible.

1187
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,513
Now.
Whose interests do you challenge when 

1188
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:45,470
you make that edict?
So?

1189
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,520
Well,
actually I've got side very quickly.

1190
01:02:47,521 --> 01:02:51,360
I know you've got to stop.
I guess where I'm going.

1191
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,283
I'm literally going to church.
I do know I was talking to Brian Cox 

1192
01:02:57,061 --> 01:02:57,894
early to do in the book,
but there's a guy who sat next to me on 

1193
01:03:00,281 --> 01:03:04,320
the panel and he was in Hong Kong,
a property developer and he said,

1194
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:05,310
uh,
the,

1195
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:07,470
one of the things about China that,
that's rather,

1196
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,570
which is good,
is the,

1197
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,071
the,
the,

1198
01:03:10,071 --> 01:03:10,904
the interests that,
those fossil fuel interests that those 

1199
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:14,190
big companies,
it doesn't,

1200
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,480
it doesn't exist in China.

1201
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:19,710
The ruling party make the decision.
They made the decision based on we don't

1202
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:21,360
want pollution,
we want less pollution.

1203
01:03:21,361 --> 01:03:23,610
Could it's killing our people and we 
want cheap,

1204
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:24,653
accessible power that is solar.
So immediately I will draw a line 

1205
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:28,463
through 105th,
the contract for 150 coal fired power 

1206
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:33,720
stations and I'll change it to solar 
panels.

1207
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:34,733
Done.
And,

1208
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,780
and he said,
he,

1209
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,190
he argued,
I do obviously counter arguments,

1210
01:03:38,191 --> 01:03:41,940
but he argued that that's why he said to
me,

1211
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:44,610
that's why China will beat you,
beat you,

1212
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:46,260
because we will make decisions like 
that.

1213
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:49,230
Now we could debate that.
But it's interesting.

1214
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,750
And one thing that's always is distinct 
is that China,

1215
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:54,750
it comes from a different philosophical 
tradition,

1216
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:55,584
has a completely different Veltin Sean,
so he's able to make decisions like 

1217
01:03:58,561 --> 01:03:59,394
that,
not just because of Maoism and post 

1218
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:01,853
communism,
but because of the philosophies that 

1219
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:04,090
proceeded it.

1220
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:04,923
Brown,
I said just because when people are 

1221
01:04:06,121 --> 01:04:06,954
listening,
I know that there are big problems with 

1222
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,024
human rights.
I was thinking I'm not waving the flag 

1223
01:04:10,201 --> 01:04:11,034
for the Chinese system and there are 
systems within which those interests 

1224
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,530
matter a lot less.
Yes,

1225
01:04:16,531 --> 01:04:17,490
there are,
there are.

1226
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:18,324
And that's what is interesting to me.
What I feel Brian Cox is that you have 

1227
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:27,200
been kind of I in my language,
I profit and an educator and a Swami for

1228
01:04:29,551 --> 01:04:30,384
such valuable beautiful information.
And who knows what the future holds for 

1229
01:04:35,461 --> 01:04:36,121
me,
you know,

1230
01:04:36,121 --> 01:04:38,650
you get my vote on the next David 
attenborough deal.

1231
01:04:38,651 --> 01:04:39,121
Like,
I mean,

1232
01:04:39,121 --> 01:04:39,954
like I,
I see he was very much the human voice 

1233
01:04:41,551 --> 01:04:42,870
of science.
But for me,

1234
01:04:42,871 --> 01:04:43,704
like as you have indicated,
there needs to be many voices in the 

1235
01:04:46,741 --> 01:04:49,470
human conversation for us to have a 
chance.

1236
01:04:49,471 --> 01:04:50,470
And,
uh,

1237
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:51,323
once again,
what I feel like is that there is much 

1238
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,570
to learn from the realms that can never 
be empirically demonstrated.

1239
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:01,410
And now like I know that sounds quite 
high minded by simply talking about love

1240
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:03,790
and kindness and the ability for 
ordinary people for,

1241
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,540
to have their needs met and to have 
impact on the power Sagan said,

1242
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,403
for small creatures such as we,
the vastness is variable only through 

1243
01:05:09,811 --> 01:05:11,010
love.
Oh right.

1244
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:12,220
Carl Sagan.
That's given to us.

1245
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:14,820
Where Brian Cox,
I want you to on record,

1246
01:05:14,821 --> 01:05:16,710
make a commitment to come back and be 
interviewed again.

1247
01:05:16,711 --> 01:05:17,650
Would you do that?
Yes.

1248
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:19,660
Whenever you want.
I enjoyed it very much.

1249
01:05:19,661 --> 01:05:23,730
I will be back tomorrow with you on.
I really loved it.

1250
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:24,623
Might get intense because we're coming 
at things from quite different 

1251
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:26,963
impositions,
but I absolutely adore you and I'm very 

1252
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:30,010
grateful to you for the education.
Thank you.

1253
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:31,480
I've enjoyed it very much.
Thanks man.

1254
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:32,314
Cheers.
