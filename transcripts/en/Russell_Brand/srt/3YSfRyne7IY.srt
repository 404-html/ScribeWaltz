1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,283
This is a very special edition of under 
the skin because I'm not even hosting 

2
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:06,324
it.
I am the guest this week under the skin 

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:11,370
will be hosted by the Great Welsh 
philosopher,

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,390
the Dylan have a merchant new 
consciousness.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,523
It is Brad Evans.
And what this man doesn't know about 

6
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:19,524
violence isn't worth knowing and I 
should are less rate myself and kick me 

7
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:28,780
own editing before I deny his knowledge 
of the subject of violence with the uh,

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,663
with my book coming out,
Brad has kindly agreed to interview me 

9
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:34,770
on the subject of recovery.
Brad,

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,010
I have my very much as a philosopher 
over the course of these,

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,873
uh,
of this excursion into the subcutaneous 

12
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:42,324
world.
We've become friends and I'm very 

13
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:44,394
grateful for you doing this.
I will now hand over full authority to 

14
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,990
you and bowers.
I do.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,873
I'd like to begin by saying,
I've obviously read an advanced copy of 

16
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:56,160
your book and it was actually a real 
privilege privilege to read it and I was

17
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:59,430
actually taken by a lot of the courage 
that you put down on the pages.

18
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,740
So that to me is something to be deeply 
applauded.

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,540
Now,
the one thing I guess,

20
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,261
you know,
I'm also,

21
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:06,960
I guess kind of humbled that yachty 
shall trust in me to do this.

22
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,853
So,
so thank you and thank you for our 

23
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:09,990
friendship.
That's something with,

24
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,220
you know,
a cherishing.

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,630
Um,
I'd like to go,

26
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,010
you know,
directly into this question.

27
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:14,791
As I say,
it's kind of,

28
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,260
you know,
it's interesting being on the other side

29
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:19,200
of this and the one thing that,
which I kind of think about,

30
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:21,180
you know,
is that for anybody who writes a book,

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,090
they know that it's a whole series of 
procrastination.

32
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:26,460
Sometimes it takes months,
often it takes years.

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,353
And I guess the first thing that really 
struck me was what compelled you to 

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,230
write this book at this particular point
in your life?

35
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,720
I felt that anybody that's in recovery 
who has this experience where,

36
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:43,110
what begins is something that you're 
using to tackle a particular addiction.

37
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,180
In my case,
initially,

38
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,050
crack and heroin becomes sort of over 
time.

39
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,143
Like I realized that the tools and 
techniques I was using to one day at a 

40
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,374
time not used drugs and alcohol were 
becoming utilized in every area of my 

41
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:01,830
life.
The way that I feel about sex,

42
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:05,760
the way that I feel about food,
all behavior and all forms of attachment

43
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,600
can be tackled,
or at least my perception of them can be

44
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:14,280
ordered by working the 12 steps.
So excuse me,

45
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:17,850
coffee mate.
But so what I felt was like this,

46
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:18,684
I'm like at this point in my life where 
I feel like I've gone through so many 

47
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:25,550
layers of disillusionment,
disillusionment with fame,

48
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,423
disillusionment with Hollywood,
this illusion when the sex and 

49
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:28,764
disillusionment is,
I think by and large are bloody good 

50
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:32,530
thing.
Who wants to be illusioned?

51
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,590
You know,
like so you know,

52
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,510
and like,
so I felt like,

53
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:36,981
you know,
the,

54
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:37,814
the recovery is the lens through which I
live my life is that my relationship is 

55
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,490
conducted through the program that I 
described in this book.

56
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,020
Obviously my spiritual development,
the way that I relate to other people,

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,033
I by no means do it perfectly,
but it is a technique that makes it so 

58
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,474
effective that I want you to expound it 
because I've seen it change lives of 

59
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:01,600
people with really serious chemical 
dependency,

60
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:05,960
really serious behavioral problems.
And I think it's a technique that offers

61
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:10,150
is a kind of counterweight to the 
overriding,

62
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,830
uh,
ideology of our time,

63
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:15,540
which just seems to me to be a kind of 
determined an icon and yeah,

64
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,380
conscious self centeredness.
Yeah.

65
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:18,920
I don't think,
you know,

66
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,753
when I was reading the manuscript and 
this call for transformation really 

67
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:26,060
comes through then you can see that as a
very personal journey that you go on.

68
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,640
Um,
I guess I was trying to figure out,

69
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,563
um,
what type of book it actually was and I 

70
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:34,220
know this is bloody ironic or come from 
a song called postmodernist right there.

71
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:36,980
I was trying to label it and classify it
and I think,

72
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:37,814
you know,
in an affirmative way it's almost like 

73
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:40,064
an anti self help book.
And I think what I of mean by this is I 

74
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:46,190
think the central message,
which really jumps off the pages is that

75
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:49,310
it's precisely these kinds of traits of 
a self centered,

76
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,820
individualistic kind of fuck the world 
narrative and all,

77
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:53,654
it's kind of loving sentiments,
which kind of gets us into this fix in 

78
00:03:55,581 --> 00:03:56,414
the first place.
It's kind of just help yourself 

79
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,393
narrative.
And I think what really to me comes out 

80
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:05,141
of this is more about a sober in perhaps
more truthful cry for human connection.

81
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:07,640
Is that where you see the hope?

82
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,373
Yes.
Cause I think our culture and our 

83
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:15,821
biochemistry collude to create a kind of
a chronic individualism.

84
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,850
And I feel that the natural conclusion 
of uh,

85
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,313
uh,
kind of a secular rejection of the 

86
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:27,050
mystical leads us to the conclusion that
we are just individuals.

87
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:30,410
We're here to survive.
We're here to fulfill our impulses.

88
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,160
In the original 12 step literature,
it says like,

89
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:39,190
we have no argument with those people 
that say perhaps man's purpose is simply

90
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:42,980
to fulfill these bike camp by a chemical
drives to procreate,

91
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:47,210
to survive,
to dominate the selfish gene approach.

92
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,313
But he says one thing we are certain of 
is no one has made a worse mess of this 

93
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:55,250
way of life than we'd at suffer from 
alcoholism and addiction.

94
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,383
And like me,
when I tried to live my life as a means 

95
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:03,641
to find personal fulfillment are getting
into sort of a kind of peculiar despair,

96
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,750
I start to feel lonely.

97
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,583
I start to feel disconnected.
That don't mean I don't pick up the 

98
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:12,780
cudgel once again and try to find my way
back to false prophet.

99
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,170
Why I feel qualified to write a book on 
addiction.

100
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:16,340
He's because I've been addicted to 
heroin.

101
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:18,080
I've been addicted to crack.
I've been addicted to fame,

102
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:18,950
money,
sex,

103
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,290
relationships,
other people's approval.

104
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:26,291
I see this phenomena emerge again and 
again and I'm starting to think that the

105
00:05:26,781 --> 00:05:30,680
label of addiction in itself is too 
confining.

106
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,560
That actually this is the human 
condition in motion.

107
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,700
You're yearning itself,
yearning and we live in a culture.

108
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:38,534
I think that usually does is fuel this 
will to acquire a know like I thought 

109
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,983
it's become,
the reason I wrote the book is because 

110
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:49,874
it seems to me that simple though.
This is an particular though is in 

111
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,970
origin.
It entailed within,

112
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:56,804
it are tools that could people's 
perspective in quite a profound way and 

113
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:04,070
what you say there brad about it takes 
you from a point of view of going,

114
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,890
Oh,
if only I can get this when I get that,

115
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:07,550
I'll be cool.

116
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,383
Or if that person understood me or if I 
could have sex with that person or if I 

117
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:11,414
could get those shoes.
All of these part being personal 

118
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:13,814
examples from my own life,
like everyone be okay and it doesn't 

119
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,400
work.
But if I go like,

120
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,273
you know,
and I don't do it enough because I'm 

121
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,250
again,
I every day I wake up,

122
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,233
once again,
bewitched and hypnotized by individual 

123
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:25,944
isn't.
But when I'd go and spend time helping 

124
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:28,244
other people,
sometimes in real blatant sub Princess 

125
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,143
Diana,
why he's like going into a homeless 

126
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:35,480
shelter and getting proper hands on and 
being amongst it.

127
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,493
Or if just on a basic communal way like 
we human being should be taking phone 

128
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,450
calls from other people that are 
suffering,

129
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,030
reaching out and talking about their 
problems for a change,

130
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,500
which you know is odd that it needed to 
be full made for me to understand it.

131
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,840
Cause I'm sure a lot of people just 
bloody do it naturally,

132
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,853
but it just gives me a different way of 
talking to my mates if my mates are 

133
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,090
going through relationship struggles or 
personal struggles or work struggles,

134
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,960
I think,
oh why?

135
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,793
Well,
this is good cause I can connect to you 

136
00:06:58,641 --> 00:06:59,474
here and while I'm talking to you,
I won't be thinking about myself and my 

137
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:04,700
own problems.
And the more I do it,

138
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,391
you know,
I think,

139
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,000
you know,
like in Christianity Brad had la,

140
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:08,480
I want to know what you think about all 
this stuff,

141
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:10,730
man.
But when it talks about when Christ says

142
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,300
it,
get down with a poor,

143
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,510
that's where he's at.
And it's not like,

144
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:15,344
oh my God,
look at the scars and lesions and like 

145
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,240
there's some energy there when you're 
helping others and the Chi.

146
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,133
And not only that,
the other people that help others are 

147
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:23,834
beautiful.
So you start to feel a kind of elevated 

148
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,820
sense of connection,
purpose,

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,530
meaning all of these words that are,
I think being increasingly marginalized,

150
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,020
empathy,
all these things that are being excluded

151
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:36,854
from the sort of political ideologies of
our time and the social ideologies of 

152
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:44,860
our time suddenly become accessible 
fruit as most basic thing.

153
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:45,090
Right?

154
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:45,850
Hmm.
Yeah.

155
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,200
There's an interesting point in terms 
of,

156
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,034
you know,
I think we can all kind of know in our 

157
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:53,260
lives when human connections seem deeply
meaningful to us,

158
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:55,210
right?
And we know that these connections exist

159
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,313
and we thrive on them.
And we know that they're kind of really 

160
00:07:57,731 --> 00:08:00,900
reciprocal because they're based on an 
ethical understanding and,

161
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,883
and that idea of love with one another.
But we often driven actually two 

162
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:06,490
relationships,
which as you say,

163
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,533
we're trying to seek affirmation in the 
wrong places and they become very toxic 

164
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:11,494
and they become,
and sometimes society can actually 

165
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:17,320
promote those types of relationships,
which we know what actually deeply,

166
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,150
you know,
detrimental to ourselves,

167
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:21,640
to our emotional wellbeing,
toward intellectual wellbeing.

168
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,683
And yet we still strive for them.
And even though we know they are 

169
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:26,950
completely empty,
meaningless,

170
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:29,980
or indeed maybe be nihilistic in terms 
of our own sense of self.

171
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:30,814
And I think that's,

172
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,050
that'd be romanticism.
You know,

173
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:34,720
I'm not saying that we're at a,
romanticism is a mendacious idea,

174
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:35,431
but the,
the,

175
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:39,400
the notion that you can find fulfillment
by being with some aspirational figure,

176
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,000
some dietary,
I'm living God as your own personal.

177
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:44,950
Jesus,
I'll find salvation if I find them.

178
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:46,660
One,
you know that that idea,

179
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:47,494
I think he's highly prevalent but even 
more toxic than this I think is the 

180
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,990
commodification of relationships that 
that happens on quiet the,

181
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,510
as I say,
it's a collusion between bio,

182
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:58,344
chemistry and culture.
Like it's very natural I think on some 

183
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:04,650
level to meet a man and think,
what can this man do for me?

184
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,440
Can he serve me?
Can he make me feel better?

185
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,333
Can I make money?
Is you're going to be a good ally in a 

186
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:11,160
fight?
What can I do with it?

187
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,113
Or in my case with women,
do I want to have sexual intercourse 

188
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,270
with that woman?

189
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,740
Is this person gonna make me feel 
better?

190
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:17,574
I was.
If this is the commodification and the 

191
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:19,830
objectification,
it happens.

192
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,290
In my case it happened quite quite 
automatically.

193
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:26,700
I have to work to not approach 
relationship in that way.

194
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,660
So I wonder,
so for me the program is the antidote to

195
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:34,380
the type of thinking to which I have a 
tendency that's all it addiction is,

196
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,420
is a tendency left on my own.
I will go that way unless I intervene.

197
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,700
Unless there is a program and the other 
thing breath,

198
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:42,534
I think he's,
it seems to me to be important is we 

199
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:47,640
don't choose between a program and no 
program.

200
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,880
We have a program.
You have the program of your family,

201
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,820
you have the program of your society,
you have the program of your culture,

202
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:58,050
you have the program of consumerism.
If you don't undo that program,

203
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,230
if you do not be code yourself like 
someone leaving a cult,

204
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,770
then that's the program you're living 
with the program of I'm not good enough.

205
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,350
I'll never be good enough unless I get 
this object or that object.

206
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:09,540
I won't be good enough on this.
That person can accept me.

207
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,703
Now what I think this offers because it 
was designed to tackle alcoholism and 

208
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:18,450
addiction is a way of untangling the 
strands that web os to materialism,

209
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,540
consumerism and objectification and 
individualism.

210
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,870
All of these things that are based on 
the idea that what can be measured,

211
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:29,340
what can be white is what is important.
See like my um,

212
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,510
it's not like I am anti atheist in any 
cognitive,

213
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,470
you know,
I know loads of people.

214
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,313
There are a few is probably you like 
that are fantastic and incredibly smart 

215
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:37,314
and compassionate and wonderful people.
My concern is that there's a thread 

216
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:41,034
within atheism that tells you that all 
the only thing that matters is that 

217
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:46,610
which can be ascertained and science in,
in,

218
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,463
in all of its main disciplines is 
forever peripheral forever on the brink 

219
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:52,230
of new discoveries.

220
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,213
And when you get someone like Elon Musk 
saying by like look with the kind of 

221
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,370
virtual reality technologies we have 
now,

222
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:00,204
there's no way of proving that we're not
all currently living in a virtual 

223
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:05,030
reality.
And I had a gun,

224
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:05,903
my mates virtual reality thing,
my little mate Israel is only 11 years 

225
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,020
old and a four.
Oh my God,

226
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,950
you can be immersed now in a totally,
totally different reality.

227
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,810
So we elon musk sign,
if we can do that,

228
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,020
imagine what other cultures could 
conceivably do.

229
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,030
You can't rule out the possibility that 
this is one.

230
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,290
Well,
bloody hell,

231
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,510
that's what it says in the bag of our 
Gita,

232
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,350
except it doesn't use the word computer.
You know,

233
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,250
like what is it that you want?
You know,

234
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:30,084
now we're saying it's the material world
is an illusion that's like it's 

235
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:34,920
transmitted into your consciousness,
through the senses.

236
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,873
You reconfigure it and you end and the 
inflections of your culture denote what 

237
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:40,644
meaning you attribute to the external 
stimuli and the only way of decoding 

238
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:45,114
that I think we're not the only way,
but a way of decoding that is by 

239
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,280
impersonal set.
In personal crisis,

240
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,530
you get the opportunity to reevaluate 
that crisis could be divorce,

241
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,423
it could be drug addiction,
it could be a heartbreak or some other 

242
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,620
existential crisis.
But when you're at that point,

243
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:01,480
whether as an individual or as a 
society,

244
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,463
you can say,
is this the kind of life I want to 

245
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:07,150
believe that I want to live?
Do I believe it could be different?

246
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,223
Am I willing to accept help?
Once you take those are the first three 

247
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:12,220
steps.
Once you take those three steps,

248
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,680
it's possible to have transformation.
After that,

249
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:17,740
there's a process of inventorying,
a willingness to change,

250
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,030
and then a devotion to conscious contact
and to service,

251
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,670
and then you've got a completely 
different way of life

252
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,750
in the world.
Yeah.

253
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,571
I think there's,
you know,

254
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:26,340
this reevaluation is,
you know,

255
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:27,690
it's,
it's an I,

256
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,220
it strikes me as a really important 
thing,

257
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:30,054
but it's also a very difficult thing to 
start to reevaluate everything about 

258
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:35,700
your own sense of self,
your sense of behavior.

259
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,743
You know,
it's often easier to project your 

260
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:38,820
troubles onto other people.
Or are they,

261
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,350
rather than actually saying,
actually,

262
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:42,360
is this something about my own self,
which I needed to,

263
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,110
you know,
what,

264
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,943
how am I shamefully compromising with 
power in a way that's affecting my own 

265
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:47,754
relationships with the way I'm 
objectifying things datafication and so 

266
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:51,460
on.
But I wanted to bring us onto the,

267
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,010
with the step that you said,
you know,

268
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,870
because I think when I was reading the 
book,

269
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:57,090
the first kind of couple of chapters was
kind of like,

270
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,040
yeah,
I can go with this.

271
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:58,200
Right?

272
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,651
It's kind of,
you know,

273
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:00,390
there's,
there's this step around,

274
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:01,830
okay,
admit you have a problem,

275
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,070
then go and speak with somebody.
Then you go into this section.

276
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,053
No,
what you need to do is write an 

277
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:08,670
inventory of all the things which really
piss you off,

278
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,181
right?
And then I go,

279
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:10,110
Whoa,
wait a minute.

280
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:10,944
Right?
This is where it's starting to get 

281
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:12,541
challenging,
right?

282
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,770
And it's going to start to get 
difficult.

283
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,993
And you,
you even say those words at the 

284
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:16,051
beginning,
he said,

285
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:16,321
look,
you know,

286
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:17,250
this is not easy,
right?

287
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,900
This is difficult.
And,

288
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,110
and you talk about,
you know,

289
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,023
this,
write down all those things which you 

290
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:25,080
think create a s and you're an assault 
on your sense of Salford,

291
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,123
on your sense of dignity and you know,
and the phrase you actually use you as 

292
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,140
the uncomfortable confrontations,
right?

293
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:33,870
So deal with this uncomfortable 
confrontations in your life.

294
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,620
And I was wondering how did you actually
feel,

295
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,723
of course,
from writing the book because in many 

296
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:44,760
senses you must have had to revisit a 
lot of uncomfortable confrontations,

297
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:46,980
which you'd already might've kind of 
dealt with.

298
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,720
But in writing the book there was almost
like an attempt to kind of revisit those

299
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,460
issues.
And you know,

300
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,070
how,
how did you feel right in this book

301
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,660
because of the efficacy of the program,
Brad,

302
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,703
it did not feel like the resurrection of
their cadavers of my past because they 

303
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:09,160
have been buried.
And even in examine them,

304
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,500
this metaphor is going well.
And for the purposes,

305
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,800
for the purpose of the book,
like a,

306
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:16,020
it didn't,
they,

307
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,030
they don't bring him back to life now.
Like you know,

308
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:19,864
sort of,
I have a propensity to return to states 

309
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:22,990
of shame,
you know,

310
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:27,940
I like that I have that in me is easily 
triggered in me is easily triggered like

311
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:28,774
leading up to my wedding.
Like cause I think like is the way I 

312
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:34,270
sort of have been explaining this.
You might like it,

313
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:36,790
right?
My Mate Matt Morgan,

314
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,730
he said to me,
keeps climbing up high.

315
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,313
We went down crime up there.
She'll fall on your head or smash open 

316
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:43,871
like an egg.
Right.

317
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:45,370
And ever since Matt said that a little 
boy,

318
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,780
a cutlet and keeps going,
oh no.

319
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,650
My head or smash like an egg.
And Matt said the image is too lurid for

320
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:52,400
the child about our handle it,
you know,

321
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:54,530
like it's too potent an image.
Right.

322
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:57,080
So me getting married,
like I don't think,

323
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,520
Oh,
I'm getting married in the morning,

324
00:14:58,521 --> 00:14:59,750
like standing.
The only way I think,

325
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,880
well what is marriage?
Marriage is a ceremony.

326
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:02,714
This is a ritual.
This is about the relinquishing of the 

327
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,550
ego.
This is about coming together and making

328
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:10,490
a vow to become a different man and to 
live in alignment with new principals.

329
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,620
So on the causes that I'm looking at,
what,

330
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,840
what you know,
inadvertently accidentally,

331
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:15,674
we've not consciously,
but somehow actually looking at what is 

332
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:18,734
the meaning of a marriage in juice is a 
state in me that's the point of ritual 

333
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,150
to induce a particular state.
Meredith says,

334
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:27,440
my friend Meredith,
she goes,

335
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,600
people think that religion is about the 
text.

336
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,433
It is about the ritual.
It doesn't matter if you can't 

337
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:33,074
understand the Latin mass.
Better to just hear a lot of babbling 

338
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,340
and something.
What is this guy talking about?

339
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,150
You know,
like,

340
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,950
which I'm sure some people identify with
right now.

341
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,383
Like you know,
it's like the ritual induced the state 

342
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:45,980
in me.
The fear was so terrible.

343
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:47,870
The fear was so terrible,
Brad,

344
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,713
of what am I going to do?
And I had to use this program to cope 

345
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:54,890
with the level of fear.
I thought about getting married the next

346
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,723
day.
Not any fear about marrying my wife 

347
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,170
cause I really wanted and really wanted 
to.

348
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,780
But something about that ritual,
that ceremony,

349
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:05,210
it meant something.
It wasn't nothing.

350
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,320
It wasn't,
oh,

351
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:08,930
it's a little bit of paper.
So I turn up at Church and then a party.

352
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,471
No,
no,

353
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,831
no,
no,

354
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:10,940
no.
My friends,

355
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,560
there is the unseen.

356
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,630
There is the invisible.
There were,

357
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,823
there is something happened to me and I 
had to surrender 100% I had to 

358
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:19,400
surrender.
I said,

359
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:22,570
what is this fear trying to tell me,
what does the field one,

360
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,480
the fear is communicate in the fear is 
talking to me from my own biochemistry,

361
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,460
for my own body,
from our own consciousness,

362
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,340
a message,
a powerful message is being said sin.

363
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,640
And if I don't listen to it,
something bad is gonna happen to me.

364
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,890
I surrendered,
I surrendered wholeheartedly.

365
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,260
And every time I do that in my life 
improves.

366
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:40,094
New States of consciousness are achieved
through the surrendering of these 

367
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:46,730
biochemical circuits that somehow 
containers these neurological loops that

368
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:50,900
we Lao to encircle us and tether us to 
low states of consciousness.

369
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,370
I think you know.
No,

370
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,480
no,
I'm those familiar.

371
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,363
Yesterday on the bus,
I'm taking the of this new state of 

372
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:59,210
consciousness and I,
but I want to connect with,

373
00:16:59,211 --> 00:16:59,250
to

374
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,980
back to a question of philosophy 
because,

375
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,270
um,
you know,

376
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,163
the trouble is with this bloody critical
theories as we can't read any book 

377
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:06,834
without actually looking for the 
political and philosophical 

378
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:08,880
implications,
right?

379
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,391
Go on.
So,

380
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:09,811
you know,
like,

381
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,030
you know,
I'll read Alice in wonderland,

382
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:11,864
I go,
this is the best bloody book of 

383
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,320
political theory ever written,
right?

384
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,820
But often we read books and actually 
most,

385
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,703
a lot of them are just devoid of any 
significant philosophical significance 

386
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:21,660
or implications.
In other words,

387
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:24,030
they don't force you to think about a 
problem differently right.

388
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,133
Now,
the one thing which I admired about the 

389
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:30,300
book was it's,
it's actually has a very deep political,

390
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:33,060
philosophical,
philosophical architecture to it.

391
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:36,540
And the one thing which I was kind of 
struck with the book and what I was kind

392
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,374
of excited when I was reading with his 
is when you talk about this attempt to 

393
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,050
connect about connection,
you also link it to the question.

394
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:43,471
Of course,
you know,

395
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:44,304
life is very fleeting,
life is short and we need to find these 

396
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:50,070
connections and a meaningful existence.
And I what the book really

397
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,903
kind of finds almost like a rescue in 
for me is an attempt to introduce 

398
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:56,034
something of the substantive over the 
superficial and the substantive for you 

399
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,384
is spiritual.
And I was wondering how you can kind of 

400
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:03,324
maybe riff,
you know,

401
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,610
talk maybe a bit more about that,
that you know,

402
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,593
what is it about the spiritual that is 
substantive for you in terms of dealing 

403
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:11,034
precisely with maybe the philosophy of 
the book or is it a standard about the 

404
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:18,120
spiritual to me is its efficacy.
It works when I do these things,

405
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,700
I feel better when I am kind.
When I'm loving,

406
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,710
when I surrender,
I feel better.

407
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:26,910
Now these things can't be measured mack 
and mechanized or monetize,

408
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,893
but they are in fact in fact effective.
There is some truth in them that is 

409
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:34,920
difficult to legislate or iterate.
So that's right.

410
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:36,840
Works for me.
And I think perhaps the reason that this

411
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:39,930
program is so good is I didn't invent 
it.

412
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,250
It was invented or constructed by 
someone else,

413
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,470
like you know,
in the 19 for easy in America,

414
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:47,304
a chronic alcoholic bill Wilson,
who after like an incredible source of 

415
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:54,810
an epic drinking binge or the type which
are defined his life,

416
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,793
had what he described as an epiphany.
And I believe epiphany to be the 

417
00:18:59,041 --> 00:18:59,874
revelation of essence that previously 
concealed revelation of essence would 

418
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:05,610
want to feel this way.
What's going on?

419
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,593
Suddenly,
you know why and bill was an has this 

420
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:11,004
epiphany and realize is that he will 
never be able to be free from drink and 

421
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:15,774
the problems that result from it unless 
he helps other people to not even 

422
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,100
realize he's one he can never drink 
again one day at a time too.

423
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,203
He's going to have to help other people 
that have the same problem in order to 

424
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:28,590
achieve this state and set about it 
immediately.

425
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,440
First of all,
traveling drunks in New York,

426
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:33,150
going up to people in bars going,
let me help you,

427
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:34,980
let me help you.
And then predictably saying,

428
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,950
no,
get off and leave me alone.

429
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,560
Then eventually it has this sort of a 
program,

430
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,423
uh,
an experience which in the myth of the 

431
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:47,160
foundation of alcoholics anonymous is 
the significant moment,

432
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:50,310
the defining moment in their conception,
I suppose.

433
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,643
Or He's in Akron,
Ohio and it worry for a business 

434
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:56,214
appointment and it comes on him.
He's in the hotel that he's staying at 

435
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,160
and he sees the bar and he hears the 
music and he's tempted to go in and,

436
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:05,310
but adjacent to the entrance to the door
is a public telephone.

437
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:06,780
This is the 1930s,
remember.

438
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,300
And uh,
he takes a chance and he rings up and he

439
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:11,070
calls up a local priest and says,
look,

440
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:14,120
if you've got anyone or a doctor,
maybe he calls like a,

441
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:14,954
have you got any [inaudible] have you 
got anyone in this area that's been 

442
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:19,980
coming in going,
I'm a terrible drunk,

443
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:20,880
helped me help me.

444
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,721
And that guy goes,
yeah,

445
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,530
we are.
He goes,

446
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,080
can you put me in touch with that guy 
cause I need some serious help.

447
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,730
Like I want to help him.
And he goes,

448
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:27,564
Oh yeah,
this guy needs a few more phone calls 

449
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:29,490
here and there as they make the 
connection,

450
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:30,324
but eventually ends up with Doctor Bob,
the other founder of alcoholics 

451
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,810
anonymous goes around his eyes and he 
says to this guy,

452
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:38,430
listen,
I've got this problem.

453
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,453
I,
I'm unable to stop drinking once I 

454
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:42,630
start.
It's ruining my life.

455
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:44,160
I ruined on my relationships with my 
job.

456
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,650
Opportunities fall apart.
It's destroying me.

457
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,500
It to him,
he's condition.

458
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:51,160
The other guy starts talking about his 
problems.

459
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:53,460
The two of them having initially like 
the bird there,

460
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,540
apparently the doctor Bob Guy was like,
you know,

461
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,580
I'm only going to tell him like he 
totally secretary,

462
00:20:57,581 --> 00:20:58,990
come get this guy off the 10 minutes.

463
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,100
Okay.
It seems a bit weird.

464
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:02,620
I'm getting phone calls out of blue.
When people want to talk about boots,

465
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,020
they end up talking for hours and hours 
and hours.

466
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,680
They recognize at the end of the four 
hours that neither of them would want it

467
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:13,681
to drink during that whole time because 
the alcohol is not the problem.

468
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,700
Alcohol is the solution to the problem 
of living under the false ideals.

469
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,090
Of a materialistic society.
People are looking for something.

470
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,410
They're looking for connection.
Some people just can't live without that

471
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,244
connection,
so they find another solution to living 

472
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,390
without the connection.
Booze,

473
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,860
drugs,
sex,

474
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,173
gambling,
and I think we're all on the scale 

475
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:36,634
somewhere.
All of us are one way or another trying 

476
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,220
to come up with it.
They're very,

477
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:40,510
like couple of days later,
the two of them,

478
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:42,550
they start going to hospitals,
traveling other people.

479
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,453
Oh,
there in people here that are here 

480
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,450
because of alcohol related problems.

481
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,980
Yeah,
that dude over in that bed,

482
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:48,814
he's been a pain in the ass all night.
You can hear him shouting from behind 

483
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:52,870
the curtain and that the two of them go 
over there,

484
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,730
hit him up and suddenly,
you know this,

485
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,611
this is,
you know,

486
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:57,490
as you know,
a lot more than me,

487
00:21:57,491 --> 00:21:59,590
Brad,
within luckily historical terms,

488
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:02,110
this is only the 1930s we're in 2017 
now.

489
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,480
This thing grows and grows and grows.
People realize,

490
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,160
oh my God,
this works.

491
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:06,994
It works.
Now that it's written in the Christian 

492
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:14,251
language of the time is written in the 
patriarchal terminology of the time.

493
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:20,310
It's also understandably protective of 
its identity.

494
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,183
The anonymity is to make sure that Aa as
a thing is protected and that no one 

495
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:26,020
person,
certainly not me,

496
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:26,921
can say,
Oh,

497
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:30,340
I'm Mr Aa because I know that I'm really
still crazy.

498
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:33,400
I could drink or take drugs tomorrow,
send me captains and you know,

499
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,570
I don't know.

500
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,010
I don't know what I'm going to do.
I'm certainly,

501
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,780
you know,
as I've made clear in the book,

502
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,650
it's not written from a position of 
authority.

503
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,493
It's written from a position of 
experience and I don't know better than 

504
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,124
anybody.
Like I don't know what crazy things I'm 

505
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:48,340
going to do.
I just,

506
00:22:48,341 --> 00:22:50,770
but I know that if I work this program,
I'll be all right.

507
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,360
If I work this program,
I'll be all right.

508
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,313
The only problem stuff for me when I go,
I think I'll take control of this 

509
00:22:55,531 --> 00:22:58,690
situation and starting that cause me 
then ego,

510
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,430
desire,
pleasure,

511
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,080
fear,
rage.

512
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,063
The other program steps back in.
So the reason the spirit is important 

513
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:07,840
because it's the only thing that can 
transcend the material.

514
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:08,674
It's the only thing that can house it.
It is the crucible of the material 

515
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:12,430
world.
What is consciousness?

516
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,930
Where did it come from?

517
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,200
What the fucking hell is going on Brad?
Like,

518
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,910
and for me,
this very simple tool,

519
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,803
it gives us access to consciousness in a
way that we will not attain if we live 

520
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:24,214
in accordance with our biochemical 
drives and a culture that uses it to 

521
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,030
turn us into passive consumers.
Yeah,

522
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,060
I think you can connect this to the 
politics of the times in terms of,

523
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:31,720
you know,
on the one hand,

524
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,553
you know,
we constantly told that nobody's in 

525
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:34,151
control,
right?

526
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:36,790
So we have to accept insecurity,
vulnerability,

527
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,440
and that can lead to a lot of people to 
be an anxious.

528
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:39,274
But what York seemed to be saying is 
actually letting go of this very 

529
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,920
ridiculous idea that we can be in 
control of other people's behaviors,

530
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:45,860
other people's lives,

531
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,190
like bloody North Korea this morning.
If we dwell on these things,

532
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:50,900
then we're going to live in the 
basically,

533
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:51,803
you know,
in this constant state of anxiety about 

534
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:55,850
things we can't possibly deal with.
And I think that's kind of,

535
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,610
and how do we seek some kind of 
affirmation out of this world.

536
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,473
Maybe the turn,
I just said it a different sense of the 

537
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:03,770
consciousness might be the alternative 
to that.

538
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,790
But I want to come back to your story 
about you know,

539
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,180
this question of confining.
Cause the example you talk about,

540
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:09,014
you know,
these two guys were speaking and of 

541
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:15,080
course there they are confiding in one 
another and that idea of have to confide

542
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:17,300
in one another.
That of course requires confidence,

543
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:18,920
right?
To confide requires confidence.

544
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,053
You need to have the confidence to 
confide in somebody and it might be a 

545
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,374
random stranger,
but at least you have an established 

546
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:28,160
trust around this kind of sense of,
you know,

547
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:28,970
of the confidence.

548
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,210
And there's a particular passage I want 
to read from the book.

549
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,133
Um,
not only I think because it brought a 

550
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:37,940
tear to my eye and I don't to shut on 
your illusions people have of me.

551
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:40,700
I do have emotions every now and again.
It doesn't seem like it.

552
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,180
I did an excerpt,
the trues on suicide and you,

553
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,790
it's like you're reading the side of a 
tin of beans.

554
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,510
I know you're very emotional,
but also because you know,

555
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,950
I think it really addresses what's at 
stake here and this kind of,

556
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:52,461
you know,
it says,

557
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:53,294
you know,
suddenly my fraught and frighten 

558
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:55,964
childhood became reasonable and soothed.
My mum was doing her best and so it was 

559
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,340
my bad.
Yes,

560
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:04,460
people have made mistakes,
but that's what humans do and I am under

561
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,294
no obligation to hoard these errors and 
allow them to clutter my perception of 

562
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:09,734
the present.

563
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:10,843
Yes,
it is wrong that I was abused as a 

564
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:12,704
child,
but there is no reason for me to relive 

565
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:18,980
it consciously or unconsciously in a way
that I conduct my adult relationship,

566
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,083
my perceptions of reality.
Even my own memories are not objective 

567
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:24,734
or absolute.
They are biased and they come be 

568
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:28,034
altered.
Now this to me is a really powerful 

569
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:30,794
passage in the book because what you're 
talking about is not only can we 

570
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:35,084
sometimes you know,
decide and we do have a choice around 

571
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,893
Utah.
If you talk about the things that we 

572
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:40,724
hold and carry along with us,
I'm not saying that we can ever forget 

573
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:43,784
them or we can outlive them,
but we can choose whether they define 

574
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:48,350
our lives are not.
I'm the fitbit central message,

575
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:49,184
which I think comes out of this as a 
very positive message is if you do 

576
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:53,024
confined in others,
that's where the transformative 

577
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:55,904
potential happens.
You cannot simply trans wake up one day 

578
00:25:58,761 --> 00:25:59,594
and say,
I'm going to be an entirely new 

579
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:02,170
subjectivity.
You know,

580
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,780
it doesn't happen that way because in 
order to change your behavior,

581
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:07,610
you need to change your behavior in the 
eyes of others,

582
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,140
right?
We are human,

583
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,220
you know,
we're not human beings,

584
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:11,054
we're human becomings right.
We'd always connecting to people in 

585
00:26:12,991 --> 00:26:16,850
disconnecting and reconnecting and in 
that sense it requires a certain,

586
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:19,460
you know,
confidence to transform.

587
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,080
I wondering what you think about it in 
terms of your experiences,

588
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,270
Brad.

589
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,103
One of the things that recurs lately 
since Yanis Varoufakis it on this 

590
00:26:27,341 --> 00:26:28,780
podcast was,
you know,

591
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:31,780
we exist in dialectic.
What is of like,

592
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:32,614
you know,
seal me in a pod and shoot me into 

593
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,110
space.
Like an,

594
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,260
what am I,
what am I without rf Jarvis cocker,

595
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:40,540
put it more simply without people.
We are nothing,

596
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,120
you know,
like so like yeah,

597
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,040
quite right that it is a collective and 
communal activity.

598
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,550
This book you could learn,
you could read it on your own,

599
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:51,384
you could do the program on your own,
but primarily it's about how you relate 

600
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,130
to yourself and how you relate to other 
people.

601
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,530
And uh,
the passage that you read from a book,

602
00:26:58,531 --> 00:26:59,364
just to clarify,
the abuse happened outside of my family 

603
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,563
and you're,
the thing that I think is important 

604
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,980
about,
um,

605
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:07,970
you know,
the,

606
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:08,803
the my stance that you can,
one can alter their perception of the 

607
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:14,190
past and if you will alter your 
perception of the past,

608
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:17,040
you will to the present.
Is that there?

609
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,240
Yeah.
As I said there,

610
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:20,310
there is no objective reality,
but you're right.

611
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:22,260
This is going to be a state that's 
difficult to achieve.

612
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:24,440
Just sat in the room.
You go to Chondrocyte that to yourself.

613
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,020
It has to be realized in relationship.
I believe.

614
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,040
Yeah.
Um,

615
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,193
I want to connect this then now then to 
the social implications of the project 

616
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:38,320
that you've already talked about.
You know,

617
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,183
you see kind of addiction as something 
which is not just an individual 

618
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,850
pathology,
but it's a social construct,

619
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:46,450
right?
We,

620
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,283
you know,
society gives you these certain values 

621
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:50,314
and those values in many ways play to 
the human desires in a way which lend 

622
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:56,580
themselves to addictive personalities.
And actually we are taught to desire the

623
00:27:56,581 --> 00:27:58,500
very things which could bring us back 
down to it.

624
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,343
You know,
on our knees.

625
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,120
And there's something about the tub log 
pressing Britain,

626
00:28:01,121 --> 00:28:02,620
which is kind of revealing of this,
you know,

627
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,990
we'd like nothing more than the 
celebrity who falls,

628
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:06,430
right?
Because it's almost like this,

629
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:08,620
that's not the system failing.
It's working all too well,

630
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,480
right?
Because we kind of expect us,

631
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,314
right?
We want this to kind of happen and you 

632
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:14,890
know,
but I want to kind of connect it also to

633
00:28:14,891 --> 00:28:18,080
your other work on,
and I think you know,

634
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,933
some of the other powerful work and 
advocacy work you've done on the war on 

635
00:28:21,881 --> 00:28:24,640
drugs and Lincoln,
this question of addiction to drugs.

636
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,863
Now as we know,
historically the war on drugs has been 

637
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:28,804
kind of separated between almost like a 
war legal paradigm versus a Health 

638
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,030
Development Paradigm.
Now I think,

639
00:28:34,031 --> 00:28:34,864
you know,
the shift towards seeing it as a health 

640
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:40,360
problem is a positive shift away from 
the wall paradigm.

641
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,840
But too often when we shifted then to 
the health paradigm,

642
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,140
it invariably retreats back into 
individual pathology,

643
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,003
right?
It's the person who's just simply a 

644
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:50,714
fault because you know,
they've fallen through the cracks or 

645
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:53,584
whatever else.
And I think what your book is also 

646
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:56,980
trying to do is add another layer onto 
this and say,

647
00:28:56,981 --> 00:28:58,420
yes,
you know,

648
00:28:58,421 --> 00:29:01,120
addiction is a health problem.
It's a mental health problem.

649
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,283
But unless we understand the social 
consequences and the social effects 

650
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,440
which give rise to this problem and 
constantly feed it,

651
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,760
then we will not gain a real tangible 
purchase on this.

652
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,820
And you know,
I wonder what your thoughts on this,

653
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:19,180
cause this is to me is I find is really 
important in terms of really pushing the

654
00:29:19,181 --> 00:29:23,140
debate forward on addiction and the war 
on drugs more generally.

655
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:23,974
And my question of violence and 
everything else which follows the 

656
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:29,170
criminalization of drugs is a useful 
social yeah.

657
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,900
In the management of populations.
And this has been explored in films like

658
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:37,950
13th and the House I live in brilliant 
films on,

659
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,843
uh,
how the criminalization of drugs allows 

660
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:42,430
you to,
uh,

661
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,250
portions of the population,
you know,

662
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:49,240
form of Niekro politics,
creating new economies,

663
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,510
new opportunities for social management 
and social engineering,

664
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,553
particularly in the United States 
economically requires slavery in some 

665
00:29:57,551 --> 00:30:01,210
form to sustain itself.
[inaudible] health model.

666
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:02,110
You're right,
that's it.

667
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,050
I hadn't really thought of that,
of that.

668
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,913
The implications of a health model is a 
determinant means that individual 

669
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:14,881
pathology is the,
is southernly the defining contribute to

670
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:17,974
the condition.
There is clearly a relationship like a 

671
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:26,680
young man Hari's written about addiction
and he like the example he sites his rat

672
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:30,490
park where you know rats that were kept 
in conditions like that.

673
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:31,324
You know like cause it's interesting 
you'll love this is a a postmodernist 

674
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:34,714
dear brad that there's the assumption of
what normal is in in laboratory 

675
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:41,590
conditions though they with unthinkingly
uh,

676
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:45,120
have this is normal and they put rats in
cages and got a lot of these wraps.

677
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,730
They much prefer the water bottle that 
was full of crack cocaine,

678
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,070
the normal water and then someone point 
out,

679
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,070
oh no mate,
it's probably horrible.

680
00:30:51,071 --> 00:30:51,904
Avoid that cage and sorry.
All right let's give him a nice cage 

681
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:55,120
then we've all,
you know,

682
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:55,954
good shit to do.
And they stopped taking crack curiously 

683
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,213
enough.
So you know there is undoubtedly like 

684
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,593
addiction can affect anybody but 
particularly chemical dependency but it 

685
00:31:07,551 --> 00:31:11,170
is certainly exacerbated by economic 
depravity.

686
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,970
But there are different forms of 
depravity.

687
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:17,960
Also emotional depravity is like,
it's not a condition that the,

688
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:22,961
the sort of the economically deprived 
people have exclusively control of hello

689
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,330
be nice from turf exclusive and trolling
or something.

690
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:31,000
But it's effects are felt more there.
If you can't get into treatment,

691
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:35,820
if you can't afford to address it is 
more likely that you,

692
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:36,654
you know,
I mean you're criminalized from the get 

693
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:38,380
go.

694
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,213
You're already a criminal.
So now is what degree of criminality is 

695
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:46,090
it that you're going to cop for?
When I went to that,

696
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:46,924
um,
I went on a police raid in west London 

697
00:31:49,181 --> 00:31:51,400
once and it was like,
you know,

698
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:52,234
it was,
it was a very revelator re-experienced 

699
00:31:54,731 --> 00:31:55,564
for me Brad.
Cause like the bad the door in of what 

700
00:31:57,101 --> 00:31:58,960
was a crack house.
Like you know,

701
00:31:58,961 --> 00:31:59,794
even the term crack house once I've got 
like even me as a person that's been 

702
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:04,600
crack houses,
I've never really sort of questioned the

703
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:07,750
idea that that's,
that's an Aos,

704
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,033
it's not really a crack house.
And you went here like we went in there 

705
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:14,530
and bought dwelt within the crack house 
was not monsters.

706
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,440
It was like beating down the door of the
leukemia ward,

707
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,990
thin,
emaciated,

708
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:24,820
broken people slumped,
Pale in a chair,

709
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,880
denied sunlight of every variety,
spiritual and literal just holding their

710
00:32:31,211 --> 00:32:36,211
lives together with drugs and that it's 
interestingly circular that this program

711
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:41,930
on an individual level takes from self 
obsession and narcissism and deposits.

712
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,763
You are a point of service and kindness 
because that is precisely the program 

713
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:51,140
that's required on a social level that 
if we have an inclusive,

714
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:56,290
empathetic,
loving society that that necessarily you

715
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,323
the these you include people,
it would become a more inclusive 

716
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:01,844
society.
I think this model of sacrifice that 

717
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:07,490
exists within Christianity,
the,

718
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:08,324
the,
the,

719
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,530
the sacrifice.
God for me,

720
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,450
I apply in my life when I ever I see 
suffering,

721
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:21,410
I think that guy's homeless so I don't 
have to be a mate of mine.

722
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,440
Got his leg amputated recently and he is
a person who works this program.

723
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,650
Like I met him at a sort of a conference
for drug addicts,

724
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,070
very badly organized and,
and he was on crutches and like,

725
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,780
Oh you white mate.
I'd only met him once before,

726
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,770
you know,
it was a nice guy,

727
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:37,670
but I didn't know him that well.

728
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,020
You're right.
It's called Pete.

729
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,790
Are you all right mate?
He goes,

730
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,571
Oh yeah,
I go,

731
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:42,650
what's with the crutches,
you know,

732
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,880
expecting are,
you know,

733
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:47,150
a trip to broke my ankle.
Some sort of minor interest story.

734
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:47,870
And he goes,
Oh,

735
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:48,703
I've got cancer.
I'm having my leg amputated at the knee 

736
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,120
and I've fucking ill bloody.
And he goes,

737
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:53,391
no,
no,

738
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:54,590
no,
I'm good.

739
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,260
I want to live.
I want to be clean.

740
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,273
And I was sort of like some wave hit me 
of like the truth of what he was saying 

741
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:04,250
and the beauty cell four oh learn about 
this person.

742
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,950
I'll call his number,
stayed in touch with the week leading up

743
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:08,720
to the amputation.
He's fine the night before.

744
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:10,220
The amputation is fine for at the 
amputation.

745
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:11,630
I speak to them the next day.
He's on a,

746
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,583
on a bed,
admittedly on opiates because of the 

747
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,740
nature of the pain medication.

748
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,753
It were blissfully happy and he 
continues to be because with this 

749
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:21,950
program,
this is a program is effective.

750
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,920
He transcends the material condition and
just says,

751
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,990
well,
my leg is being amputated.

752
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,153
I can't control that,
but I can control my reaction to my leg 

753
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:35,960
being amputated and I think about this.
I can't get it obviously out of my head.

754
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:39,140
How was this guy managing this?
How is he doing it?

755
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:41,960
Because he's not putting it on and I'm 
talking to him every day or at Ross,

756
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,030
some just doing this thing.
Yeah,

757
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,900
I'm doing of recording another thing 
today.

758
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,710
So also he's happy and the reason is is 
because he's accepted it.

759
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,544
He surrendered it.
He's working this program and he's 

760
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,760
getting on with his life.
He's not gone now.

761
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:56,930
I will be defined by this problem and 
that's unbelievable.

762
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,793
That's unbelievable to me,
that is that powerful and it's that 

763
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:00,230
effective.

764
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,450
Now he does this again,
as we say in communion,

765
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:04,850
in conversations,
so it works on an individual level,

766
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,833
but you're quite right brad.
It's not something that we should 

767
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,870
ascribe to individual pathology because 
where are these bloody boundaries?

768
00:35:11,871 --> 00:35:14,570
What do you mean an individual?
We're all made of the same stuff.

769
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:18,230
We're all thinking the same force rules,
feeling the same feelings other than the

770
00:35:18,231 --> 00:35:23,231
variety provided by cultural inflection 
and social conditions were all basically

771
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,253
basically the same.
So like if we have systems that 

772
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:28,184
encourage empathy,
if we have systems that emphasize the 

773
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:34,370
Corolla and connection between us,
then we will build a better.

774
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:35,204
So I think,
yeah,

775
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,160
and I want to push you on the,
the title,

776
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,980
which is recovery.
And I think,

777
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:43,680
you know,
you could offer almost like a simplistic

778
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,440
reductive reading of the title,
which is almost like,

779
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,453
you know,
how can you kind of go back to a 

780
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:50,970
previous better self?
Right?

781
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:51,804
So how do I recover myself?
It's almost like the George Best 

782
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:54,211
question.
I,

783
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:55,800
where does it all go wrong in your life?
Right?

784
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:57,580
And then if you can pinpoint this,
but as we go,

785
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,433
as you see,
you know,

786
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,540
for a lot of people who are in this 
condition,

787
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,523
it's the social forces,
the complex social forces that is no 

788
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:06,960
pinpointable moment in somebody's life 
where you can say,

789
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:07,794
this is kind of what it all goes wrong.
But I think the way I understand in the 

790
00:36:10,941 --> 00:36:11,774
way you're using the term recovery also 
is also a critique of the idea that we 

791
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:17,760
can live a perfectible life under.
The,

792
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:22,780
one of the striking things which comes 
out for me of this is kind of a humility

793
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:25,680
with what you're talking about is,
you know,

794
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:26,514
on the one hand,
not only not to take yourself too 

795
00:36:27,871 --> 00:36:28,920
seriously,
although we have,

796
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,783
you know,
we have to deal with serious issues in 

797
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:34,200
the world,
but also this idea that it's okay not to

798
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:37,860
be okay sometimes and to admit this is 
no bad thing.

799
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,130
That's true and this is something,
again,

800
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:40,964
I've only really found in,
we've been spiritual conversations and 

801
00:36:45,741 --> 00:36:47,930
spiritual,
not not in the right word,

802
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:50,420
but it's like for me,
this has always been framed spiritually.

803
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:53,420
Like when I talked to Sharon Salzberg on
this podcast,

804
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,060
she said that when you're meditating is 
normal,

805
00:36:56,061 --> 00:36:59,120
that you start thinking all the time.
You don't punish yourself for that.

806
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,120
You just returned to the mantra or 
return to the breath.

807
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,063
You accept fallibility as part of the 
part of the equation of your humanity 

808
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,043
that you to a degree relinquish the idea
of perfection but sort of somewhat 

809
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:14,810
paradoxically I suppose Brad,
uh,

810
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,693
the,
the one of the meanings or implications 

811
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:18,554
of the term recovery is that you recover
the person you're supposed to be 

812
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:23,120
supposed to be an info Commons I 
suppose,

813
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:28,121
but meaning that I natural bio chemical 
entities that as a human being or a tree

814
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:32,540
does have in it a code,
it has an intention,

815
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,390
it will grow a certain way if unimpeded 
by,

816
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,770
in our case,
social,

817
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:37,870
cultural,
personal,

818
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,130
familial conditions.
So what this,

819
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,203
the point of recovery is,
is to get you back onto that intended 

820
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:44,864
path.
And it is my belief that the intended 

821
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:51,290
path is not to be a passive consumer.
It just cooperates as an,

822
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,760
as a unit within a,
within a system of sales.

823
00:37:55,761 --> 00:37:58,850
Just as a statistic,
we are engaged.

824
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:03,851
We must re be reborn until the present 
so that we can become really what we are

825
00:38:05,301 --> 00:38:07,070
so that we can become what we are.
Yeah.

826
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,263
So

827
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,713
did of rebirth.
I'm going to kind of try to end then on 

828
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:12,594
a very positive note and go,
and then at the start of the book you 

829
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,380
deal with the big impending d or The 
death question,

830
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,930
right?
So nothing more positive than death.

831
00:38:21,931 --> 00:38:22,870
Right?
Um,

832
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,720
and as you pointed out here,
the introduction,

833
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,840
the reality of death individually and 
yet it's certain,

834
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:30,150
right,
is something we don't like to talk about

835
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:31,240
publicly.
Um,

836
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,363
and yet of course we know from Plato 
onwards there's this idea that to is 

837
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:37,480
effectively to lay it out,
to die,

838
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,360
I need to learn and to death might not 
be a physical death.

839
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,610
It might be the death of a relationship 
or the death of,

840
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,444
you know,
an idea of the death of a person you 

841
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:46,240
once were.
And you can kind of more than this,

842
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,470
right?
But I don't,

843
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:48,304
however think this goes far enough and I
think actually we might need to take it 

844
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:51,520
a stage further.

845
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,010
And there's a quote from David Bowie 
when he puts it,

846
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:54,844
he says,
religion is for people who fear how 

847
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,140
spirituality is for people who have been
there.

848
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,970
Now,
I think with this in mind,

849
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:01,804
I think the question your book kind of 
leaves me asking is how can we learn to 

850
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:09,040
examine our lives in a way in which may 
be,

851
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,780
as you say,
the addict,

852
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,290
you know,
has a certain experiential value,

853
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,440
right?
Because they have seen rock bottom,

854
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,670
right?
They can look at life almost the example

855
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:23,500
you give of the people who are deprived 
of light,

856
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:25,750
right?
In this amazing created state,

857
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,650
they know what it means to look at life 
from the perspective of death,

858
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,450
right?
The old must already dead,

859
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,800
right?
So I think,

860
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:33,634
you know,
in terms of then your hopes for the 

861
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:35,974
book,
you know,

862
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,873
and looking at the future,
how can we learn and maybe take the 

863
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:40,714
voices of these people much more 
seriously in terms of if we appreciate 

864
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:47,080
we're all kind of knee deep in the mud,
right?

865
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,430
And we know existence is tragic,
but we know existence is also wonderful.

866
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,343
All right.
So how can we maybe learn to go beyond 

867
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:55,324
this question of just simply learning 
how to die and look at life from the 

868
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,104
perspective of death and become much 
more affirmative of what we actually 

869
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:04,240
have in this all too fleeting existence?

870
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,450
Well,
for me,

871
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:10,960
Brad,
it's become certain,

872
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:15,961
quite simplistic attitude or north 
shifts such as acceptance,

873
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:21,370
gratitude that I relinquish the idea 
that the,

874
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,520
I'm not homeless in a Gob smacked up off
my nut because I'm somehow superior,

875
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,443
but just because of a sort of a random 
set of coordinates and events have 

876
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,370
deposited me in a comfortable life and 
I'm really,

877
00:40:36,371 --> 00:40:37,204
really lucky and gracious so I don't 
have a punitive attitude towards those 

878
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:43,330
people.
And I see him in like,

879
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,370
you know,
sort of sometimes he'll write ourselves,

880
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:49,730
but where I came as repositories,
it potentially of great truves and um,

881
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,460
important information.
Uh,

882
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:56,490
one of the recovery charities 
organizations that do work with it,

883
00:40:57,731 --> 00:40:58,564
Bac O'connor,
they run facilities in Burton on trend 

884
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:05,500
in their United Kingdom and stoke on 
Trent in the middle and as those areas.

885
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:06,334
And I went to an event with them the 
other day and like just spoke to that 

886
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:12,370
service users,
which means in this case,

887
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:13,204
drug addicts and stuff and like to talk 
through what they're doing in their 

888
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:16,330
program.

889
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,163
The counselors,
a good number of the counselors 

890
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,290
themselves,
people in recovery,

891
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,850
which I think is always very,
very helpful.

892
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:22,923
And then afterwards,
my wife was there and that sort of sat 

893
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:26,860
in there.
They put on a lovely spread for us.

894
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:27,790
God loves them.
You know,

895
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,673
some Christian,
maybe something even as far flung as 

896
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:31,714
Bruschetta a,
but the kind of Bruschetta would get in 

897
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:35,060
stoke on Trent.
Yeah.

898
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,680
Catch up.
May have been involved.

899
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,341
I manage,
I can,

900
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:38,420
it's perfectly nice.
Anyway,

901
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:39,254
there's this bloke there who was a 
proper to glance at like if you can 

902
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:45,110
imagine shaggy from the cartoons,
Scooby Doo,

903
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,093
but he slept outside for a year and he's
had a bloody good kick in and no dental 

904
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:51,560
work.
Like this is what this guy looked like,

905
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:56,561
fin broken and uh,
like drug addicts obviously.

906
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,250
And I like,
he's sort of,

907
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:00,590
he's come lay and he's fin is fuck.

908
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,290
And he's like,
ransacking the buffet quite gently,

909
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,580
you know,
just thinking of this food.

910
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:08,330
Then I'll take that and sort of packing 
out and stuff and all goes,

911
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:09,400
all right mate.
And that goes,

912
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,400
oh yeah,
your urine.

913
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:11,234
Yeah.
And I'm like,

914
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,111
yeah,
yeah,

915
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:13,070
yeah,
that's right.

916
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:14,930
And,
and the like,

917
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:15,764
because I'm like,
when I'm among other people that have 

918
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:18,104
got addiction issues,
I feel like I don't have the obligation 

919
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:20,804
to try and act like I know what I'm 
doing or that I'm clever or that I'm in 

920
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:25,830
control.
And I said,

921
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:28,310
sank too about feeling like,
oh yeah,

922
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:30,470
like I maybe mentioned fame in some 
capacity.

923
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:30,981
And I go,
yeah,

924
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:34,580
but I do get like,
get nervous and I get frightened.

925
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,480
He goes,
what'd you get it?

926
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:37,550
And for you like your,
you're Russell brand and like,

927
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,210
who cares what other people think about,
you know,

928
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,083
if you would imagine there's people that
know you if they don't know you're 

929
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:42,890
fucking right.

930
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,900
Now,
obviously this is highly colloquial,

931
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,973
but like,
uh,

932
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:47,323
also for me is sort of profound and 
beautiful and also the fact that he's 

933
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:55,070
even willing to take that role when 
meeting someone who's,

934
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:56,900
they're sort of visiting in kind of 
like,

935
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,060
I'm here as a patron of this 
organization,

936
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,090
but that he,
like,

937
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:03,800
he's not like dumbfounded by the idea 
that I'm nervous and fearful.

938
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:05,000
He accepts,
Oh,

939
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:08,720
this guy is just the same as me and 
there's an honor in that,

940
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,010
you know,
a real honor.

941
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,970
And I think they've awakened people not 
only realize it but somehow can live it.

942
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,420
I'm sort of realizing it,
but the challenge is living in,

943
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,590
you know,
like that is,

944
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,833
there is no distinction.
There is no separation between him and 

945
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:23,900
me.
We were all experiencing it.

946
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,100
We're like,
as the Great Bill Hicks said,

947
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:28,610
we were all one consciousness 
experiencing itself subjectively.

948
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,980
And when I realize I'm live,
that I'm not on my own anymore,

949
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:35,390
I'm not afraid anymore.

950
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,223
I don't have these obligations to prop 
up some Avatar of myself that people 

951
00:43:40,011 --> 00:43:40,844
might love or approve of or boost up or 
make much off to ameliorate some inner 

952
00:43:45,731 --> 00:43:47,830
sense of worthlessness.
There is uh,

953
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,390
the,
the solve is in the wound,

954
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,370
the salvage in the wound.
You know,

955
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:54,590
when someone punishingly says I'm 
worthless,

956
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:55,424
I am nothing.
Is it trying to reach the truth beneath 

957
00:43:58,611 --> 00:44:01,910
that that we are essentially not 
divided,

958
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,720
separate from and therefore are 
everything in the one.

959
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:09,700
This is not about annihilation of the 
self as in the subjugation,

960
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:10,543
you know,
sort of refer to your work in a violent 

961
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,353
and destructive way.
But the recognition that there is no 

962
00:44:17,631 --> 00:44:18,464
need for fear and there is no disease 
need for desire because we are already 

963
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:26,960
one,
we are already one and that these things

964
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:30,440
are not just philosophical tropes or 
empty mantras.

965
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:31,274
They are things you can live by 
recognizing that your own suffering can 

966
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:38,760
become a tool and the suffering of 
others can be an opportunity.

967
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,713
If you can just break out of the 
preexisting and imposed paradigm that 

968
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:48,600
you are here to earn money that you're 
worth is established by what you've got.

969
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,310
You know,
and like,

970
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:51,144
oh Jason Segel the act,
so I'm friends with him and he went all 

971
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:55,680
those things we defined ourselves by 
like,

972
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:56,514
you know,
maybe there's a billboard up with your 

973
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:58,164
face on it.
It's just the symptoms of other people 

974
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:02,310
making money out of you.
It's not you,

975
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,533
not you.
And all of that being flown around in a 

976
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:06,204
jet and fate it over like,
cause that's not something to fear not 

977
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:11,760
doing.
That's something too.

978
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:15,240
We've escaped because,
gosh,

979
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:15,901
yes,
it's a,

980
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:16,880
in it's way,
it's,

981
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,720
there is glamour.
They of course,

982
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:21,030
glamour is a thing.
People respond to it,

983
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,740
pleasure and all of those things,
but there's no real worth in it.

984
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:27,870
Like I met that homeless guy once and 
let not,

985
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:28,650
no,
he was not homeless.

986
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,820
He was going to what?
It was some homeless people.

987
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:30,654
I met him in New Orleans and he was off 
to go and sort of help out or some 

988
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:34,650
homeless deal,
you know,

989
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,380
feeding homeless people.
And he didn't recognize that was famous,

990
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:39,150
that sweaty guy.
And he said to me,

991
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:40,890
um,
a fame money,

992
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,160
all of that.
That's the crumbs I want to be at.

993
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:44,994
The bank quit the bank,
quit and somehow been tricked into 

994
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:48,893
finger near.
That's what real religious people tell 

995
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,701
you that actually,
you know,

996
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:52,130
you'll get out of wine.
I'm crack on.

997
00:45:52,131 --> 00:45:54,710
We it didn't,
but this is not about subjugation.

998
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:56,840
This is not about asset as Susan.
This is not about denial.

999
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:57,674
This is about finding the truth.
And often the material world is 

1000
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,800
preventing you from,
from getting there,

1001
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,693
is preventing you from getting there.
Cause we caught up and you want to 

1002
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:08,580
mentation and we can't see that we're 
all part of one garment.

1003
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,530
Yeah.
So then to kind of sum up,

1004
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,890
the one thing which I've take really 
taken from the book,

1005
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:14,883
um,
is being alone and loneliness is the 

1006
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:19,014
greatest killer.
It's it because not only does it result 

1007
00:46:22,561 --> 00:46:26,700
in people dying prematurely,
but I can kill your sense of self esteem

1008
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:29,070
and dignity.
And the two,

1009
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,043
I guess messages,
which I wanted maybe just reiterate it 

1010
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,460
for why take from the book is that if 
you are feeling alone,

1011
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,820
speak to someone or if you see in 
somebody who's lonely,

1012
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,713
just give them a helping hand because 
they probably need you more than you 

1013
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,713
realize.
And I think that to me is the one thing 

1014
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:47,430
that I wanted didn't you know,
to take from the book and is that how,

1015
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:48,264
you know,
do you have any final comments on that 

1016
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,080
or do you try to remind myself when I'm 
talking to people like about,

1017
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:53,943
I'm talking to another human being and I
tried to talk to them with love and 

1018
00:46:58,021 --> 00:47:02,400
respect and often if the,
if the opportunity is explicit,

1019
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:03,121
like you know,
if it's,

1020
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:03,954
I'm dealing with someone that's got drug
and alcohol problems or some other 

1021
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:09,060
problem that I identify with,
this is an opportunity to be loving.

1022
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,553
I forget this all the time.
I'm a pretty long distance from 

1023
00:47:12,331 --> 00:47:14,880
perfection.
But like I tried to remember,

1024
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:17,070
you know like Oh God,
you didn't really look at that person in

1025
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:19,410
the eyes.
You didn't make it an attempt to connect

1026
00:47:19,411 --> 00:47:20,244
with them,
but we can come from a perspective of 

1027
00:47:22,831 --> 00:47:23,664
love.
We don't need to only be coming from 

1028
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:25,524
self preservation.
We're not all here competing for 

1029
00:47:26,851 --> 00:47:27,684
resources.
It's a yes was perhaps there's some 

1030
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:33,310
evolutionary truth to that millennia 
ago,

1031
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:38,490
but it's not true now what are here to 
help one another and in deciding that we

1032
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:41,980
can create it all,
it's a pleasure.

1033
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:43,720
As always,
challenge to Russell and you know,

1034
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:44,643
thank you for the opportunity to get 
under the skin with you and turning the 

1035
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:49,690
tables around.
That was a bloody good wrap up Brad.

1036
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,360
Thank you so much for doing it.
It's really lovely to talk to you.

1037
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,070
Obviously a very beautiful person and 
you're clever and what?

1038
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:57,963
It doesn't matter what I say.
I could gotten such a long run in like 

1039
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,083
where I'm referencing Zen Buddhism,
Bloody Jack Kerouac consciousness 

1040
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:07,240
itself,
biochemistry and I could,

1041
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:08,074
it'd be good.
Yup.

1042
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,770
Yup.
Okay.

1043
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,510
I like your minds three seconds faster 
than mine,

1044
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:17,050
which I don't like incidentally.
Thank you,

1045
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:17,980
Brad.
Pleasure.
