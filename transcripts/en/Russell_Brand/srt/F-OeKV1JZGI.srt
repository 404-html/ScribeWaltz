1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,440
Do you feel ready?
You believe in God?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,060
I believe in God with often they don't 
really know.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,970
I mean like we are supported by 
invisible forces.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,230
That kind.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,820
I love that video about your,
uh,

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,730
your grandfather.
You obviously love him.

7
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:22,370
He said maybe.
What is he still the most important male

8
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:23,210
figure in your life?

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,891
Yeah.
Yeah.

10
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:27,520
He's probably the only important male 
figure of my life,

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,630
which is a strong statement to make,
but that's about right.

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,140
Do you have a good female figures in 
your life?

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,290
Women.
I try.

14
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,060
I try to be that um,
you know,

15
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:40,670
I come from a very sort of broken crazy 
family.

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,683
Okay.
I heard that sort of known of your 

17
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:43,574
uncles had been incarcerated.
So you come from a family where the 

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,390
crime is part of the story.

19
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,660
Yeah.
I mean they're not nine of them,

20
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:50,494
but five of the nine of them all spend 
some time in prison and that sort of 

21
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,173
trickled down and I have cousins that 
have spent time in prison and it was 

22
00:00:57,371 --> 00:01:01,330
just a part of my story growing up and 
it wasn't particularly unique.

23
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,193
It's so it's a weird thing to say,
but in the retrospect like that seems 

24
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:07,600
normal to me,
like we're going to go see your uncle in

25
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:08,260
prison.
Okay,

26
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,093
sure.
That's what you do normal for a lot of 

27
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,660
people.
It's not extraordinary.

28
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,553
Yeah.
Which really lets you know that you can 

29
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:16,264
create different simulations and 
different pockets of society and until 

30
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,390
you travel outside of it to have a 
different experience.

31
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,040
You think it's just the norm.

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,520
When did that happen for you?
When did your life transition from?

33
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:32,550
What was your early determining context 
to what was the thing that should change

34
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,270
first few candies?

35
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,243
Well,
I think I was always sort of an alien 

36
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:37,044
child.
Like my mother says all the time when I 

37
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:41,760
was a kid,
they were just weirded out by me.

38
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:42,594
Like I never cried.
They always thought I could like 

39
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,970
understand them as a baby in the crib,
which is really bizarre.

40
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,200
But the earliest thing that I remember 
was the first play date,

41
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,063
which was in kindergarten class.
I was five years old and there was a 

42
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:56,424
girl named Lindsey to.
She was this blonde girl with blue eyes 

43
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:01,080
and we became fast friends.
I don't,

44
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,973
I don't think we had reading class 
together and her mother invited me over 

45
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:09,111
for a play date and I went to her house 
and I was just shocked that people lived

46
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,720
in the way that she lived.
She lived in the suburbs.

47
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:16,380
She had a massive house.
She had this Victorian concept room.

48
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,130
She had a nanny,
she had a playroom and I was.

49
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:24,810
I just remember being shocked that this 
was even a part of life because prior to

50
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,270
obviously I existed within the realm of 
my family.

51
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,400
I lived in a really small apartment.
Me and my two sisters shared a room in a

52
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:37,401
low income housing a building and it 
just blew my mind.

53
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:41,850
So I think when I was a really small kid
I was already considering like,

54
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:42,684
how is this asking the question at least
which is important in order to get the 

55
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,074
answer.
How could people be living such 

56
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:52,491
different lives and you either take two 
approaches to it.

57
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,053
You either say,
I hate rich people because they live 

58
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:56,964
that way,
or I want to become a rich person and 

59
00:02:58,471 --> 00:02:59,304
learn how to live that way.
I think I've always been curious about 

60
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,480
success and wanted to learn how to be 
successful myself,

61
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:07,690
so my path was somewhat natural in that 
regard.

62
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,340
I never,
I never hated rich people.

63
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:12,220
It's a very weird thing to me that 
people demonize the rich.

64
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,413
No,
I think he hates a terrible emotion 

65
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,050
because it,
it,

66
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,660
it,
it's,

67
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,493
you harvest it internally,
so if you hate someone you hate that 

68
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,540
they're okay.
They don't,

69
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,523
they don't feel that.
So you always been an aspirational even 

70
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:26,044
when you were a child.
If it sounds to me from what little 

71
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:31,900
you've told me already that you sounds 
like you had an unusual emotional state,

72
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:34,730
that you were sort of quite an 
independent person.

73
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,220
Yes.
And that you're.

74
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,630
I mean,
even watching you,

75
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:40,450
I've watched quite a lot of your videos 
and the interviews.

76
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:43,200
You're very powerful person.
You've got driven on you.

77
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:46,240
You've got a strong presence.
Yeah,

78
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,183
and I've always had that,
like my teachers hated me growing up 

79
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,283
because I was just extremely assertive.
I think think about the functional 

80
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,383
educated.

81
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,473
That's a very good question.
I think I like to say that I was self 

82
00:03:58,091 --> 00:04:00,130
educated because you don't learn 
anything in school.

83
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:02,980
You learn propaganda,
you learn how to function in society and

84
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:05,410
the way that the government and society 
wants you to function.

85
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,290
Um,
so I like to think that because I always

86
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,124
had to earn my way through life.
My parents couldn't afford to put me 

87
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,294
through school.
My parents started paying for anything 

88
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:15,640
for me.
Um,

89
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,473
when I turned 14 years old I was kicked 
out of my house and I was living with a 

90
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:21,940
boyfriend for six months.
I was one of those kids,

91
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:23,500
you know,
um,

92
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,453
and so I,
I sort of was self taught and I was 

93
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:30,430
constantly pushing back against 
arbitrary authority.

94
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,040
Arbitrary Authority mean that because 
I'm the teacher and I say,

95
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:33,910
go left,
go left.

96
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:34,181
Well,
no,

97
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:35,590
tell me why I should go left.

98
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,790
I need to like to be a little bit,
a little bit of reasoning behind this.

99
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,863
Um,
I was always a critical thinker my 

100
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,350
entire life,
um,

101
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,760
and that sort of,
I,

102
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,603
but I didn't go to,
I went to university for a couple of 

103
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:50,920
years and then dropped out.
So I think I'm so smart because I didn't

104
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:51,754
go to university and do that thing where
you said that your auto didact self 

105
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:57,630
educated person,
what was your reading?

106
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,440
Oh,
okay.

107
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:01,750
So I,
when I was a small kid,

108
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:02,584
I loved books.
I would get totally lost in novels and 

109
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:06,850
it was a lot of fiction novels that I 
grew up on.

110
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,860
I was reading books,
very bizarre.

111
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:10,450
I mean to be like a five year old 
reading,

112
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,893
uh,
an eight year old reading Nora Roberts 

113
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:14,134
and like Dean Koontz and I just,
I love to get wrapped up in fiction 

114
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:17,344
novels.

115
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,183
Uh,
so that helped obviously in terms of 

116
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:21,280
just my vocabulary and ability to 
communicate.

117
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:23,830
I was always reading.
I was a big reader or total dweeb.

118
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm at home.
I was cool in school,

119
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,660
but it was a total dweeb at home.
Uh,

120
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,494
and I remember racing even when I was in
fifth grade to read the Harry Potter 

121
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:34,834
books,
like one of those people that was in 

122
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:37,330
line waiting for them.
She's a disaster now,

123
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:38,240
by the way,
but issue,

124
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,070
I mean her books are very good.
I'm a politically,

125
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:42,904
she a total disaster.
She should stick to fiction because she 

126
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:48,010
doesn't understand reality.
She doesn't,

127
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:49,090
she really does.
And I'm sorry.

128
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,250
She's wonderful worlds she created 
though.

129
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,060
People just get lost inside of,
um,

130
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,023
but yeah,
I didn't start reading political chat 

131
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,610
and you're fine.
Get,

132
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,290
get comfortable.
We're going to be in here for,

133
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,530
you know,
comfortable.

134
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,910
They're not leaving until we agree on 
absolutely everything.

135
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,360
I have you in a mega hats.
I'm wearing it already,

136
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:16,361
but just very nice.
Nice.

137
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,590
So yeah,
I dunno,

138
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,443
I didn't start reading I guess non 
fiction until I got interested in 

139
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:25,790
nonfiction and politics and things of 
that nature.

140
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,210
And then I started reading Milton 
Friedman and Dr Thomas Soul.

141
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,850
Ooh.
I haven't understood it.

142
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,713
Any of these references,
like even those fictional ones was 

143
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,303
reading when you're a kid.
Now,

144
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,010
will these Milton,
these modern wars,

145
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,270
the recent ones,
you know,

146
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:41,104
Milton Friedman,
the economists and Dr Thomas Soul is 

147
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:46,540
also an economist.
Um,

148
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,071
and,
but he,

149
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:48,640
he's a,
he's a black economist,

150
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,474
which was the most important reading 
that I could've done because he just 

151
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:59,131
completely makes you understand that 
people are using and manipulating you,

152
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,180
uh,
because of the color of your skin.

153
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,600
And he just uses fact based logic and 
reasons and world history.

154
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:08,990
And we'll bring you backward and forward
and show you a basic theses like,

155
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,993
um,
they make you think that because you're 

156
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:13,780
a minority,
that means that you're behind.

157
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:16,390
And that's the history of the world.
Tells us that's not true,

158
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,520
you know,
and the Ottoman Empire,

159
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,870
uh,
the Greeks owned the bank,

160
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:21,430
so it was a Turkish empire,
the Greek zone,

161
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:22,264
the banks.
And we're doing the best in that 

162
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:25,120
economy.
So he just goes through,

163
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,193
um,
world history and just shows you pretty 

164
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:28,504
much all of the fallacies and all of the
emotional arguments that are made and 

165
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,900
basically tells you if you want to get 
ahead in life and start from nothing,

166
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,913
you have to abandon these arguments is 
emotional arguments and understand the 

167
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,930
facts and how it is that you can start 
behind and get ahead.

168
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,950
And that's what I chose to do.

169
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,903
Do you think there were certain 
philosophical ideas that may have a 

170
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:48,130
truth to them when practiced on the 
level of the individual,

171
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,023
but when translated to a social scale 
become more complex and break down a 

172
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:55,930
deal?
Oh sure.

173
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:59,220
Socialism,
because it's Utopian because it takes it

174
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,940
about individualism and self 
[inaudible].

175
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:01,581
Like what,
what,

176
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,414
what?
When,

177
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,830
what?
I feel kindness is your powerful person.

178
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,933
You're driven,
you've come from nothing and you've 

179
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:09,214
achieved a lot in your life and it feels
to me at least not to suggest this to 

180
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:18,300
you because you've not directly said 
this or I'm actually.

181
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,960
I think you maybe have directly say 
stuff like,

182
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:21,460
well,
if I can do this,

183
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,130
you should do it.
Like now.

184
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:24,964
But that kind of for me is to deny your 
unique abilities and your unique 

185
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,630
qualities.
Even having drive the willingness

186
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,463
to work hard is in itself an endowment.
It's why don't say you can do what I've 

187
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:41,380
done.
Right?

188
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:44,050
I don't say that you're going to follow 
everything that I've done.

189
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:46,300
I actually hope that my kids never had 
to live through,

190
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,223
you know,
or see the things that I had to see 

191
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:49,480
growing up.
Why would I want that?

192
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:51,250
I don't think people should.
I mean just,

193
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,383
I don't want my children to,
to go see their uncle's in prison or to 

194
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:58,170
struggle financially and not to be able 
to afford to go on a school trip.

195
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,004
I don't think that that's a necessary 
thing for you to understand how to 

196
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:02,940
become successful.
Um,

197
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,060
but what I do demand is that people 
abandoned a victim mentality,

198
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,500
right?
I think that that is,

199
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,340
has become a cancer in our society to 
Mintel.

200
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,283
Give me,
give us some background on it because 

201
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,540
some people won't know what you mean.

202
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,400
It's just the oppression.
Olympics,

203
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,293
you know,
everybody wants to say I deserve more 

204
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:21,680
because I'm more oppressed than you.
Oh,

205
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:23,880
okay,
well you might say,

206
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,960
I might say that I'm more pressed than 
you because I'm black and you're white,

207
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:28,794
so instantly I'm more pressed and I 
deserve more than my voice should be 

208
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:32,730
louder.
And then we say,

209
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:33,800
okay,
well you're a male and I'm a,

210
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,750
I'm a woman,
so instantly I deserve even more because

211
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:38,760
I'm a woman and you're a male and women 
are more oppressed,

212
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:40,500
which is totally a lie.
Um,

213
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,550
and I should have my voice heard louder 
and then you keep going gay,

214
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,290
straight and they've created all of 
these little,

215
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,423
these little pockets and you have to 
figure out who is the most depressed 

216
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:51,294
person.
I guess it would be a disabled black 

217
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:56,820
female gay person would probably be the 
most.

218
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,920
If you want to win the oppression 
Olympics,

219
00:09:58,921 --> 00:09:59,580
that's it.

220
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,413
And everyone should fawn over you and 
everything you say should count and 

221
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:03,520
should matter.
And it's,

222
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,373
it's absolute crap.
The victim mentality is what's stopping 

223
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,750
most people from getting from point a to
point b should be mean.

224
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,780
But if I imagine a guy disabled and if 
you are gay,

225
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:19,030
disable a black female female,
if I imagine that person,

226
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:22,230
I don't like it and I'm sure there's 
even within that category,

227
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:25,230
I'm sure there's lots of lots of and 
lots of variety.

228
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,393
But when I think of the most powerful 
people in the world and the people who 

229
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:33,400
have the most influence,
not many of them are gay,

230
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,240
disabled,
black females.

231
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:39,600
So I felt,
well I'm not a by the way a kind of,

232
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,920
you know,
just so you know,

233
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:45,921
where we're starting from.
I feel like the difference between MSNBC

234
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,243
and Breitbart and trump and Obama is so 
small as to be irrelevant for my 

235
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:55,680
political standpoint.

236
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,520
These are what I would call the system.
Right?

237
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,510
I suppose what I'm trying to illustrate,
candice,

238
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,373
is that it's relative for me.
None of those people are offering the 

239
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:06,774
kind of social change that's required to
create the systems that human beings 

240
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,123
deserve.
Now like so what is yours to me is that 

241
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:14,514
you have a tremendous faith in the 
ability of the individual to create 

242
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:20,790
their own destiny.
Why wouldn't you?

243
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:21,624
Because you've lived it,
but do you think that that's applicable 

244
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,340
to all individuals?
I think 100 percent if it,

245
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,870
unless there are of course policies in 
place that are preventing you from doing

246
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:31,704
that.
There are not in America at this moment 

247
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:33,954
in time.
So they actually were forming our own 

248
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:39,300
oppression by buying into the idea of 
oppression.

249
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,290
Um,
you know,

250
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,123
one of the things that harmed the black 
community the most or these last six 

251
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:44,760
years has been the welfare state.

252
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,350
That's what's happening in France right 
now.

253
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,500
It doesn't work.
It doesn't.

254
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,760
Giving handouts and creating a giant 
government and not creating a,

255
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,440
you know,
incentives for people work,

256
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:54,274
which is what people want to do.
It's the human spirit that governments 

257
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:57,364
don't seem to understand that policies 
that are socialists don't seem to 

258
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:01,870
understand.
They don't account for the human spirit.

259
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,120
We want to be valuable.
We want to create.

260
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,890
Um,
so when you remove all of that,

261
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,550
you end up with people that are 
oppressed and with a variety of problems

262
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:10,384
and you can pick a ton of problems 
within the black community that I'm 

263
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:14,320
trying to reverse.
It all starts with abandoning the victim

264
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:15,154
mentality and the government tells me 
that I should feel bad for myself for 

265
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,124
being a,
a woman and being black and make me 

266
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:22,510
understand that I'm behind in society.
You know,

267
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:23,380
those are the racists.

268
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,810
Don't tell me that I need to feel bad 
about myself.

269
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,440
I don't feel that way and they sit and 
they insist that you do so.

270
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,333
The greatest challenge and and also the 
most fun I think that I have on these 

271
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:33,814
college campuses,
is that you want to see if a black 

272
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:36,634
person,
you want to see who the real racists 

273
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:37,810
are.
Tell you.

274
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,690
Tell people that as a black person you 
don't see yourself as a victim.

275
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,550
They lose their goddamn minds.
That's why they hate me.

276
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,040
Read the articles about me.
They call me a neo Nazi.

277
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,120
I mean the Guardian,
right?

278
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,240
Neo Nazi,
a supporter of white supremacy because I

279
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:54,340
believe that I can do whatever I want in
my life because I have confidence.

280
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,980
What does that tell you?
That they're rushing to smear me because

281
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:59,740
I believe that black people can do it 
without government handouts.

282
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,430
It means that they insist that black 
people do it with government handouts.

283
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:04,510
Otherwise they'd say,
all right,

284
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:06,850
she has a perspective.
I don't make any policies.

285
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:08,500
I'm not in the government.
I'm not running for office.

286
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,590
Why does it bother them so much?
Right.

287
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,750
Me,
like I feel you,

288
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,660
but what I'm saying,
it's just like,

289
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:21,280
where is compassion and love in your 
philosophy?

290
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:23,650
Where is the place for that?

291
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,331
Uh,
well,

292
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:25,650
what do you mean?
If somebody,

293
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,663
compassion to me is not telling people 
that they should be coddled because of 

294
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:31,660
the color of their skin.
I think that that's,

295
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:32,494
that's,

296
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:38,140
I've seen that over and like a button.
This is what will,

297
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,013
let me tell you this.
I've thought like say my background 

298
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:45,911
doesn't sound nearly as challenging as 
your call from him prior to celebrity,

299
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:50,210
which I'm imagining there anything you 
want to know about me,

300
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,570
but the prior to that,
like I grew up in an ordinary household,

301
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:57,380
single parent family.
My mom was sick a lot when I was a kid.

302
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:59,970
I had have intermittent access with my 
bad,

303
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:01,340
you know,
relatively regular.

304
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,174
But like that,
my parents weren't together and then I 

305
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,634
became a crack and heroin addict when I 
was sort of in my late teens and I feel 

306
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:09,974
that there are what I want to say,
like I feel that there were social 

307
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:14,894
factors there.
I think if I was from a different 

308
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:19,250
background,
had access to different resources that I

309
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:21,070
may have received.
Psychological,

310
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,913
spiritual input,
different points now like I'm not 

311
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:24,254
complaining about my life.
I've got money and got good family and 

312
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,090
stuff and I'm really,
really happy.

313
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:34,450
But I think to deny social factors in 
the cultivation of the individual really

314
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:37,640
plays into the hands of the already.
Okay.

315
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,520
Before.
Oh,

316
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,353
but I don't,
I actually don't deny those social 

317
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:41,554
factors.
I tell people at the biggest problem 

318
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:45,070
facing the black community as father 
absence.

319
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:46,930
But that's being incentivized by our 
government.

320
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,153
So the blue,
the black single motherhood rate was 23 

321
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:51,634
percent in 19 sixties before welfare 
programs were implemented today at 74 

322
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:56,084
percent in the black community.
That's because they literally will give 

323
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,470
a black mother more money from the 
government if the father doesn't live in

324
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:01,880
the home.
I'm actually really,

325
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,813
I really believe in a two parent home,
but you can just look at the statistics 

326
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:07,640
to see that children are better off when
they have two parents.

327
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,650
But think about what's perpetuated in 
our media.

328
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,320
Think about radicalize feminism.
We can do it without men.

329
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,333
F meant we hate men.
That's why I fight these concepts 

330
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:16,790
because what you're talking about is 
true.

331
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,290
That's not what people are talking 
about,

332
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,124
the political realm.

333
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,860
They want to get rid of all of that in 
favor of more government,

334
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:22,910
more government,
more government.

335
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:25,070
It's,
it's become increasingly radicalized and

336
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:25,904
it's harming the individual and their 
chances when you come from a two parent 

337
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,310
home versus a single parent.
Uh,

338
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,153
there are,
there are tons of statistics that prove 

339
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:35,360
that what you're saying is right.
But my compassion towards that is when I

340
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:36,194
go and I combat feminism right when I go
and I were a hymn to shirt to the Brett 

341
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,470
Kavanaugh,
um,

342
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,070
hearings and tobacco because I don't 
believe in the me too movement,

343
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,690
right?
I think it's been radicalized.

344
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:45,441
I think that it's,
it's,

345
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:46,274
it's a harmful feminism.
I don't even like calling it feminism 

346
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:49,454
because it's,
it's just a means for people to secure 

347
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:51,550
power,
um,

348
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,443
and it's cloaked as feminism and that's,
that's how I exercise compassionate 

349
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,230
exercise,
compassion.

350
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,213
When I go fight for the first step backs
and I understand that many people that 

351
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,544
are in prison are in prison because they
grew up in that environment where they 

352
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:06,020
didn't have any parents raising them.

353
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,910
My mother grew up in group homes,
um,

354
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,940
and didn't graduate high school.
She didn't end up in prison,

355
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:11,774
but she could have very well could have.
And so will you exercise compassion by 

356
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:15,194
having those conversations?
Those are the conversations that are 

357
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:19,820
being had at the political level or even
remote accessing compassionate.

358
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:24,320
I think that was exercising analysis,
critical thought and the intellect,

359
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:25,154
which I would never challenge you on.
Your obviously very adept and very 

360
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:31,940
strong in each of those areas.
Let me,

361
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,370
let's go into different territory for a 
moment.

362
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,390
Am I right in thinking that you suffered
from anorexia?

363
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,160
That's correct.
Younger?

364
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,023
Yes.
I suffered from anorexia for about four 

365
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:43,431
years.
Wow.

366
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:45,840
That's pretty serious.
How's your eating now?

367
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,560
I can't stop eating,
so probably me,

368
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:52,130
what the next year was like.
Well,

369
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:53,990
what's interesting is that,
and you're an interesting person to talk

370
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:56,720
to you about this because there is a 
spiritual component of Anorexia when,

371
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,540
when there is,
when,

372
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,600
when,
when you start,

373
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,860
when you starve the body,
the mind.

374
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,500
That's why people do this,
these fastings and many religions,

375
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,210
when you,
when you starve the body,

376
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,490
there's almost a mental clarity that 
takes over.

377
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,980
And that's what I think becomes 
addicting for most people.

378
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:10,814
Like for me was never about weight.
And for most people it's not about 

379
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:14,024
weight.
Um,

380
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,990
it's usually,
I mean,

381
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:15,824
when you learn about in Iraq,
so they tell you that it's usually a 

382
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:20,690
manifestation of people trying to assert
control over their lives.

383
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:21,524
And that's what it is.
It's the one thing you can control when 

384
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:26,120
you feel like there's chaos is what you 
put in your mouth and your body.

385
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,520
Um,
so that was for me,

386
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,593
after going through a unique situation 
and feeling that my whole life was out 

387
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:36,650
of control,
I just manifested as an eating disorder.

388
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,950
And I had it for four years on and off.
But like,

389
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,260
you know,
if you saw pictures,

390
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,094
I mean I was like 30 pounds skinnier,
maybe even 40 pounds skinnier than I am 

391
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:48,440
now,
which is insane if you get any help.

392
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,100
No,
I helped myself,

393
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,480
which is crazy.
Right?

394
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:52,520
But I mean,
what was I going to go,

395
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,340
go,
go talk to.

396
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,070
I'm a smart person.
So I think it's,

397
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:57,690
it's harder.
And I don't know this I'm saying this as

398
00:17:57,691 --> 00:17:58,261
a thought,
you know,

399
00:17:58,261 --> 00:17:59,940
Jordan peers don't have to tell me if 
I'm right or wrong.

400
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:02,580
He's the one that's got the,
the doctorate for this stuff.

401
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,583
But I think that it's really hard for 
people that have a higher Iq to go get 

402
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:10,194
help.
We're not the a one time that I went to 

403
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,590
a therapist,
it was with my parents,

404
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:15,210
my parents side,
they're going to try therapy.

405
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,930
The woman was just,
she was just a total moron.

406
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,640
I mean literally everything that she was
trying to say to me,

407
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,503
my family wasn't helpful and I think 
that me feeling like I didn't find 

408
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:30,441
someone that was smart in the chair 
probably sort of turned me off.

409
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,030
But if I had sat down with Dr Jordan 
Peterson first,

410
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:34,140
I probably would be like,
yeah,

411
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,130
therapy is great.
Uh,

412
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,371
but no,
I didn't,

413
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:39,570
I,
I just got better.

414
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,443
The therapy was ineffective because 
you've found the therapist 

415
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,530
intellectually and analytically inept,
but you can't just breeze into.

416
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:51,970
I just got better because anorexia that 
very,

417
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:56,971
very serious mental condition and I've 
got friends that are suffering with that

418
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:01,930
and it's like almost I'm a drug addict,
a recovering drug addict.

419
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,390
Like my own experience with addiction 
is,

420
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,990
is precisely that.
It's trying to deal with a deficit.

421
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,573
No,
my belief is that it's a spiritual 

422
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,423
deficit or lack of connection in a 
dissatisfaction with the material world 

423
00:19:17,411 --> 00:19:22,150
and inability to allied into systems 
that seem erroneous,

424
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,220
duplicitous,
meaningless,

425
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:27,130
and are powerful.
Need for some values,

426
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:29,050
some spirit now,
like we're not like,

427
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:31,270
I feel like perhaps there's a 
comparable.

428
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,570
The addiction is underscored by,
I want to say some certain universal's,

429
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:41,400
whether it's an eating disorder,
sexual obsessions or,

430
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,220
or,
you know,

431
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,660
like obviously drug addiction.
Um,

432
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:50,110
what I'm curious about is how that would
be resolved,

433
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,340
how that would end with that.

434
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,310
Identify the issue.
And what caused me to illustrator,

435
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,183
I actually realized that I went through 
this experience in high school that was 

436
00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:00,430
classified as a hate crime.
What was that?

437
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,090
It was a racist lands.
Well,

438
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:06,730
I don't consider them racist.
I think that that was part of the reason

439
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:07,564
that I caused an eating disorder,
but they left me racist voicemails and 

440
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:12,780
then it became the sore.
But I don't consider that.

441
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,473
But that is.
Does that make an individual but 

442
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,220
individual racist?
That's the question.

443
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:21,850
Can you do something without having to 
carry a label for the rest of your life?

444
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,320
Can you say something off pudding,
which I'm sure you've done many times or

445
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,750
right.
Does that make homophobic,

446
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,450
does that make you a racist,
that make you a sexist?

447
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:35,800
Can you do an app without having to 
carry a label for the rest of your life?

448
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,060
Okay.
So I'm not actually that.

449
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:41,150
That's my point.
So just for this situation,

450
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,800
there's no forgiveness.
How are we going to them?

451
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,780
That was my problem.
So this,

452
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,611
the.
They did something.

453
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,950
It was remarkably stupid.
We were a nice tool.

454
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,350
They left racist voice.
So they said,

455
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,243
well,
I don't think I can say those words on 

456
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:52,984
here,
but you can name words your way through 

457
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:54,161
it.
Okay,

458
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:58,660
so like a dirty word,
a feather,

459
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:00,280
that dirty and word.
We're gonna.

460
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,220
Put a bullet in the back of your head 
like Martin Luther King.

461
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,230
Right?
Terrible stuff.

462
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,240
I brought up a lot of African Americans,
but why did they do that?

463
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,640
Right?
Nobody cares about the why.

464
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:14,440
They just want to rush and call people 
racist.

465
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,540
Okay,
I'm still adjusting and here's how I got

466
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,340
through my name's sorter.
So this thing gets happened to,

467
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:19,900
gets taken out of control.
It gets blown up.

468
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:20,734
It's on the front page of a newspaper 
and suddenly people are discussing you 

469
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:24,470
and I,
I'm a,

470
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,300
I'm in high school.
I'm 17 years old.

471
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:29,080
It's what people want.
It didn't want that to be,

472
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,640
you know,
my high school story,

473
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:32,230
especially getting ready to go to 
school.

474
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,333
And your personal experience with 
reappropriate it and told back to you 

475
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,430
that you used as an object in someone 
else's narrative.

476
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,680
That's exactly correct.
And,

477
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,523
and then now called the victim.
Terrible racism before you experienced 

478
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,240
really bad.
I'm going to challenge you and I'm going

479
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,550
to challenge you on on the list.
I'm going to challenge you on that.

480
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,403
Have happened from there.
I'm going to challenge you on that 

481
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,410
already.
So you say that's terrible.

482
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:59,150
Racism that I experienced.
Okay.

483
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,670
Or,
or a couple of high school kids for.

484
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,510
There were four kids in that car.
One of them I knew,

485
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,390
three had never laid eyes on me and 
never even seen me.

486
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,370
The the,
the youngest person in the car was 14.

487
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,250
Are Really gonna label a 14 year old 
racist for the rest of their life.

488
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:14,350
I mean this is insane,
but of course it sells.

489
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,100
Newspapers write this terrible thing 
happened in our town and people suddenly

490
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:18,934
are invested in and moms are suburban 
moms or writing letters to the editor 

491
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:22,650
and everyone's like,
you know,

492
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,523
in this because nothing happens and now 
they have something that's happened and 

493
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:29,230
the media took what should have been a 
teaching moment for children.

494
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,250
Okay.
Why'd they do it?

495
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,720
Well,
maybe they had their first beer.

496
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,780
One guy in the car is upset with me 
because I stopped hanging out with him.

497
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:35,614
Was I got my first boyfriend,
he said we're going to call her and 

498
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:39,610
leave her a voicemail and she's black.
Okay.

499
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:43,090
You gave a drunk drunk 14 year olds a 
phone.

500
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,620
By the way,
there's no emotional connection.

501
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:47,740
Nobody ever talks about technology and 
how easy it is to be mean now.

502
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,683
Right?
You can't do that to my face or they 

503
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,740
have called me those things to my face.
No,

504
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:52,930
of course not.
It's hard to be mean in person,

505
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,970
but leaving a voicemail,
I'll say anything to this cup.

506
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,620
Right?
This is Russell brand.

507
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,360
I'll say anything goes God Damn Cup into
the Russell brand.

508
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,790
Okay.
But this is what I'm saying.

509
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,624
So people don't even consider that.
We were the first generation that had 

510
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:08,440
facebook,
instagram,

511
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:09,360
and I think,
uh,

512
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,180
it's not pronouncing instagram.
It's a strange website.

513
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,000
Instagram,
instagram,

514
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,513
instagram.
Someone on a penny farthing bicycle 

515
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,493
guard passed onto.
Sounds better that way we should be 

516
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:23,710
calling it instagram on the emphasis on 
the last syllable of instagram.

517
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:27,310
I'm coming with you on that journey now.
It seems to me that that was a traumatic

518
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:30,680
incident and your response to it was nrx
here.

519
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,880
Yeah,
which free to me,

520
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,353
but I think it's admirable that you're 
willing to be forgiving of the 

521
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,760
perpetrators of that,
you know,

522
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:42,010
because they,
admittedly we're kids,

523
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,873
but I don't think that,
that there's a few things that I think 

524
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,070
and also agree with you

525
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,903
that the media capitalize on certain 
types of hysterical and like a short 

526
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,610
kind of hysterical attitude because it 
sells,

527
00:23:53,611 --> 00:23:54,950
you know,
I don't think there is a genuine.

528
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,760
Oh No,
we're actually really shocked.

529
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,350
At least racism happen.
How can we in the,

530
00:23:58,351 --> 00:24:00,850
I don't mean that the energy that moves 
papers around or no,

531
00:24:00,851 --> 00:24:03,320
I would agree with you on that as well.
But uh,

532
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,273
but the fact that your being forgiving 
of that incident and willing to let go 

533
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:10,874
of that incident doesn't negate for me 
the fact that the particular language 

534
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,810
they used may have been socially 
resourced.

535
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:20,270
I just want to ask you about some things
that ever happened to me the other day.

536
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,290
I was like,
uh,

537
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,350
like there's a English black footballer 
called Raheem Sterling.

538
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,980
Bloody good football actually soccer 
player in your language.

539
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,180
And like,
uh,

540
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,360
someone called him a Eva Manc see unt 
black.

541
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,370
See unt,
so like,

542
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:39,380
uh,
he's pissed off about it.

543
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:42,650
Raheem Sterling got.
Yeah,

544
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:43,431
yeah.
That guy.

545
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:45,260
Yeah.
The guy lost his job,

546
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,260
like uh,
you know,

547
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,740
we can discuss that aspect of it in a 
minute.

548
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,570
But like what I was like in Raheem 
Sterling,

549
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,660
like instagrammed,
I instagrammed instagram.

550
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,070
Instagram's a post saying like,
here's two stories.

551
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:01,904
One is about like a black footballer by 
and his Mama House once about White 

552
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,210
Footballer bind his Mama House and the 
one about the white football,

553
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,760
it's like lovely young white football up
by his mom house.

554
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,800
And the one about the black football a 
by,

555
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:17,330
at his momma house is flash little 
bastard buys mom house,

556
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:18,164
right?
It's like I'm Raheem Sterling 

557
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,503
Brilliantly like sort of selects these 
two stories about the same subject and 

558
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:23,024
notes how one is rendered as a kind of 
like negatively and one is rendered 

559
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:27,344
positively.
Stanley says that this is racially 

560
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:30,344
motivated now.

561
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,540
Like I don't think I need beer.
A black person to say yeah.

562
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,413
That for me aligns with the way that the
media functions in perpetuating certain 

563
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:41,144
narratives.
And whilst you say the perpetuation of 

564
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:43,664
the victim narrative is disempowering 
African Americans or perhaps even black 

565
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:48,500
people were white,
I'm not fully sure of how,

566
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,230
uh,
the breadth of your philosophy,

567
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,210
I think it is a,
um,

568
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,273
what I want to say,
a myopic to suggest that the powerful 

569
00:25:59,151 --> 00:26:03,440
cultural narratives and historic 
oppression don't play a part in people's

570
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:04,274
current economic poverty.
Whilst the way out of that I would 

571
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:11,360
accept except would be into a individual
culpability and individual will.

572
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,050
Not everyone has that.
Not everyone has that.

573
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,970
Everyone has that drive,
that power.

574
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,893
Some people need support now with the 
role of the state and the veracity of 

575
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:23,750
the state's intentions are certainly 
things I question as well.

576
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,780
Do I think that the Democrat Party or 
super kind,

577
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:28,190
wonderful people?
Well,

578
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:30,980
we have a look at the last 20 years.
How did that work out?

579
00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:33,800
How was,
how were African Americans treated under

580
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:34,634
Barack Obama?
Like,

581
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,980
so we've got the evidence that date is 
in.

582
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,530
It's neither party worked particularly 
well,

583
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:44,460
but for me to deny that there is an 
impact of social,

584
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,570
economic and historic conditions on the 
individual experience of paypal.

585
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:49,404
And that,
that those conditions are not affected 

586
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,270
by race for me.
I don't think that's true.

587
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,411
Well,
first off,

588
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:58,080
I want to go to your two articles 
because you use the word myopic.

589
00:26:58,081 --> 00:26:58,430
Okay?
You,

590
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:01,950
you used a sample sale,
a sample of two articles to come up with

591
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:05,460
this great conclusion is every single 
room,

592
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,473
I understand that as every single 
article about a black person buying a 

593
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:11,890
house negative or did you find one that 
wasn't going to do a comparison?

594
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,863
Now hold on.
Every single article of a white person 

595
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:19,170
buying a house positive or did you find 
article of white person positive and now

596
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,004
you've used as to say at this means that
every single white person and article 

597
00:27:21,951 --> 00:27:22,784
articles written about is true or false.
I have a problem with this data set and 

598
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:27,090
this is what we see over and over again.

599
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,013
It's the same thing that they do and 
they extract the 16 unarmed black men 

600
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:32,400
that are shot and killed by police 
officers every year.

601
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,220
Forget to mention that there's a higher 
rate for white people.

602
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,380
You did the exact same thing that I 
can't stand.

603
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,040
This was actually,
I found,

604
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:40,943
I found two articles at universal.
I'm Russell brand calm down because 

605
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:47,994
firstly it was rocking sterling faster.
That counts for times that by a 

606
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:52,920
thousand.
No,

607
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,753
hold on.
What I'm saying is is you get a number 

608
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:57,054
and you can blow him out because he's 
probably better with media creates 

609
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,583
simulation one side by side and now it's
universal truth here on the Russell 

610
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,370
brands.
Listen to me for a second please.

611
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,443
What I'm saying is is that whilst of 
course all of us can construct 

612
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:17,250
narratives by selecting information that
supports our idea,

613
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,430
Raheem Sterling didn't do this in a bit 
on the Saturday.

614
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,060
Someone screams racial abuse him on the 
next day.

615
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:25,080
He goes,
oh look,

616
00:28:25,081 --> 00:28:25,914
I'm not surprised because you know,
because I experienced a lot of this 

617
00:28:28,491 --> 00:28:30,830
treatment at a subtler level in the 
white arm.

618
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,673
How did in the press,
this is he's personal experienced that 

619
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:38,040
Ryan is recounting and then we look at 
the rest of the information and say,

620
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,143
oh,
what does it seem to be like for young 

621
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:45,330
black men in England is are there any 
commonalities economically?

622
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,750
Are there any judicial or criminal 
issues where there's a commonality?

623
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,330
It's not just that these narratives 
being cherry picked,

624
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,313
there is also the date of receipt on 
incarceration of young black men in 

625
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:57,144
America because we are 
disproportionately commit crimes in 

626
00:28:59,101 --> 00:28:59,934
America.
Are we not supposed to be arrested 

627
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:03,230
because we're all doing the same thing.
They're counted your.

628
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,610
You're extracting that,
but if they do it without saying,

629
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:06,444
well,
what are the economic conditions in 

630
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:11,100
America,
but now we're missing this.

631
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,380
You're missing this.
I agree that we have been,

632
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,243
that we are.
We are economically depressed as black 

633
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:16,710
Americans.
What I'm talking about,

634
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:18,900
what we disagree on is the solution.
Okay,

635
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,200
well,
economically depressed because we bought

636
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:24,270
into the myth that government is going 
to fix our problems.

637
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:27,030
We have disproportionately been voting 
for Democrats for the last 60 years.

638
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,570
Okay,
so all of our problems are because Latin

639
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:32,640
American Emma's proportionately welfare 
programs,

640
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,040
we disproportionately might disagree on 
the solution.

641
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,710
Well,
well we're.

642
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,210
I guess we're not moment.
That's right.

643
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:40,470
So I guess this one,
we're not disagreeing.

644
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:42,130
You're saying that I'm,
I'm ignoring the fact

645
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,963
that there have been economically 
depressed and the economical depression 

646
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:46,930
then leads to higher crime rates.
I agree with all of that.

647
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,913
Okay.
What we disagree on or perhaps what 

648
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:52,270
people disagree with me on a lot are the
solutions for it.

649
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,343
Okay,
and I point out the fact of how we got 

650
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,633
here.
If you don't understand how we got here 

651
00:29:57,071 --> 00:30:00,190
in terms of buying into the idea that 
the government was gonna fix everything,

652
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,603
this victim mentality it is,
and they've been able to sell the 

653
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,160
easiest person to sell social.
Some too.

654
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:08,230
As a wealthy person a go to Hollywood,
they're,

655
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,073
they're like the number one socialist 
because they felt guilty about it's 

656
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:11,530
true.
No,

657
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,810
no,
but because they feel guilty about their

658
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:14,391
wealth,
you,

659
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:15,224
you are the perfect stereotype of 
somebody that I could get to grow 

660
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:19,060
government with Russell.
Look at these poor people.

661
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,830
Look at how well you live.

662
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,220
Look at this podcast studio.
Don't you feel bad as a white,

663
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:26,710
straight male that all of this is going 
on?

664
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,371
Oh,
of course.

665
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:28,120
Yes.
What should I do?

666
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,330
Use your platform to tell people that 
this is wrong and that you,

667
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,740
you become the voice that actually 
allows people to grow government.

668
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:36,574
And what it does is it decreases 
opportunities for black Americans 

669
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,463
opportunities with me.
That's your normal argument of normal 

670
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,910
people.
You're going to have to.

671
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,080
I'm actually just having prefer that 
smiling.

672
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,950
Start using that.
There's some rules,

673
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,140
right?
You got me all fired up because I'm not.

674
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:58,840
I'm like,
I'm not a liberal.

675
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,370
I'm,
if anything,

676
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:05,290
I'm an east coast into cluster.
I agree with you.

677
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,690
Yeah,
the centralized government.

678
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,763
But where,
where I feel you and I are gonna 

679
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:15,420
disagree is on the level of extending 
compassion to give out hugs.

680
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:16,840
Well,
what do you mean?

681
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,710
How would you,
how would you,

682
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,700
how would you learn it?
Ultimately you order.

683
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,820
How would you give up?
But like,

684
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:26,650
uh,
but I also want to ask you,

685
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,150
uh,
like when your,

686
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:28,984
what is your solution?
If we both agree that the sort of 

687
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,220
centrist left and you can't call those 
people come in and you really can't.

688
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,810
Like there's.
So there's,

689
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,350
the difference between them is kind of 
negligible between wow,

690
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,160
the difference between the Republicans 
and the Democrats is negligible in terms

691
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:45,994
of like a holistic global philosophy to 
inculcate and spread real meaningful 

692
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:53,040
change.
All right.

693
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,820
Uh,
so,

694
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,210
so what,
but you as a conservative,

695
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,310
a believer in conservatism,
what is the solution?

696
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,173
We weren't limited government.
We want free markets and in a society 

697
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,990
where people can help.
We've had that.

698
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:08,530
We've got that now mania.
First off it is working in America.

699
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,120
This is why this is the lowest rate ever
for black unemployment is right now in a

700
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,440
Donald Trump who is allegedly the most 
racist president.

701
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:15,460
If you read the Guardian,
right?

702
00:32:15,461 --> 00:32:17,260
Like he's so racist.
That's so racist.

703
00:32:17,261 --> 00:32:20,290
While he sucks at racism because black 
Americans are doing so much better,

704
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,273
there's been a 400 percent increase in 
black owned businesses because there's 

705
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:24,970
opportunities.
He's,

706
00:32:24,971 --> 00:32:27,090
he's making sure that there are actually
opportunities.

707
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,461
Do I believe in them?
Yeah.

708
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:31,690
Those sort of figures when people.
Yeah.

709
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,130
When governments go and we found out 
that the unemployment note after Scott,

710
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:36,964
let me tell you,
let they go 400 percent growth in black 

711
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:40,761
businesses.
You know,

712
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:45,020
there'll be some state in state 
sponsored initiative where you can start

713
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:47,120
your own business.
Some bullshit thing.

714
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,610
Know that you can't trust them if you 
don't.

715
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:50,810
Hey,
like do you know what?

716
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:55,010
Like if you'd like a don't believe in 
the Democrat Pie,

717
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,410
how can you believe in the Republican 
Party differences?

718
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,190
Anybody ever heard me say vote 
Republican?

719
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,290
I don't know.
It doesn't have it.

720
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,010
Yeah.
I mean I'm an.

721
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,540
I'm independent.
Okay.

722
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:09,374
So I,
I vote based on the candidate and the 

723
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,470
candidate that I believe in is Donald 
Trump.

724
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:14,930
And let me tell you,
he's neither Republican or Democrat,

725
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,390
which was so interesting to watch you on
the view.

726
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,940
Let me tell you why,
because I've watched you before.

727
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,120
I used to watch your youtube channels 
before I even was conservative.

728
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:24,530
I used to watch all of your thoughts and
I was like,

729
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:25,370
yeah,
this guy's really smart.

730
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:26,204
He's really got it.
You understand the problem with the 

731
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:28,334
establishment and.
But what you didn't realize was that 

732
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:34,010
trump was antiestablishment because you 
know why you get fooled by wealth.

733
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,113
You think wealth automatically makes you
establishment doesn't obviously he's on 

734
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:38,774
establishment or you wouldn't have the 
entire mainstream media on two parties 

735
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:43,970
that were opposing him.
He was the antithesis of all of that.

736
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,280
And he came and he slammed all of it.
Any one.

737
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,293
So I'm a trump supporter and if people 
call that trump lickin's like a portion 

738
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:51,914
of the Republican party,
because he had to run on either one 

739
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:55,130
ticket or the other.
He ran as a Republican.

740
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,830
Trump is by no means he calls it the 
swamp for a reason.

741
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:03,590
Do you think that the truly that the 
establishment is opposed to trump?

742
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:04,644
I don't like that.
That media noise and static and Shamash 

743
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,480
I,
I agree with you.

744
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:10,314
I read the stuff about him,
but he is the president of United 

745
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,900
States.
And what do you really think he would do

746
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:20,901
for vulnerable ordinary people?
And do you not think that a certain,

747
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,280
like the commercial and capitalist 
society does create huge hierarchies and

748
00:34:28,531 --> 00:34:32,520
pyramids that lead most people?
Not most people.

749
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,573
A significant percentage of the 
population to not have access to 

750
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:38,730
sufficient resources and create systems 
that are run.

751
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,600
No,
it's not.

752
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,780
If if you're saying to me that because 
some person is less driven than me,

753
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,090
I was able to accomplish more and I was 
rewarded for it.

754
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:47,260
That's unfair.
No,

755
00:34:47,261 --> 00:34:48,094
that's not unfair.
As long as we are provided the same 

756
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,940
opportunities which in America our 
system is.

757
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:54,070
If you work hard and you're willing to 
work hard,

758
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,280
you will be rewarded by system because 
some people do.

759
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,300
Capitalism is an economic model that 
lifts people out of poverty.

760
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,253
Socialism does it.
It's killed 100 million people in the 

761
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,740
last 100 years.
Post capitalism like that.

762
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:09,370
After they bowed out.
Capitalism like just 10 years ago,

763
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:12,610
capitalism about the biggest lump of 
communism in history.

764
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,340
Lucky it just was completely state 
sponsored.

765
00:35:15,341 --> 00:35:19,130
The whole things artificially inflate 
your system surviving by the merits that

766
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:22,320
espouses survival.
You're talking about,

767
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,273
if we're talking about it in 2008,
if we're talking about corruption and 

768
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:28,444
bail,
I don't think they should have been 

769
00:35:28,571 --> 00:35:28,990
bailed out.

770
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,380
So yeah,
so I.

771
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,830
I agree with that.
Yeah.

772
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,730
One hundred percent agree with you.
That's exactly right,

773
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:34,930
because that's not true.
Capitalism,

774
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:35,764
that,
that wasn't true should have happened 

775
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:38,580
there.
They should have let them go under.

776
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,430
I believe the market.
We've all wasted.

777
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:46,550
A lot of the people that paid for that.
Baylor had their houses reclaim the have

778
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,220
had their houses foreclosed,
won't get to be angry.

779
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:51,054
You won't get an argument from me.
Do you think that Donald Trump's going 

780
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:55,500
to address that?
We're going to.

781
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:58,630
Goldman Sachs was shutting down banks.
We've given these people,

782
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,830
but unfortunately he wasn't the 
president have seen now.

783
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:04,440
And do you think he's not going to get 
hit and run on that?

784
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:04,740
He,
he,

785
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,190
but what he is going to do with 
philosophy,

786
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,990
philosophies basically in alignment with
capitalism is what we're talking about.

787
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:12,210
And that's something that I'm fully 
against.

788
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,020
You know,
so,

789
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,853
um,
but I'm talking about your says an 

790
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:15,474
economic model of capitalism is the only
proven model that lifts people out of 

791
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,320
poverty,
which is why I agree with that.

792
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:23,800
But that was about when the banks food.
That's terrible.

793
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,230
Terrible.
Capitalism doesn't do that.

794
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,840
Yes it does.
That's why.

795
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,600
Why do you think America is America?
What made America America?

796
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,250
What you talking about when you say 
America,

797
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,400
do you think there is one thing called 
America underneath a flag,

798
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,920
like we're like UPI a.
This is America,

799
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:41,550
the America of poor prenatal.
There's the America of rich people.

800
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:44,790
There's all sorts of American sorts of 
experience of American America.

801
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,530
It is proven that if you make good 
choices,

802
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:47,364
if you stay out of trouble,
if you don't have children out of 

803
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:51,920
wedlock and you have a job,
you will moral code.

804
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,880
That's it and you'll be successful.
That's it.

805
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,590
That's all you have to do,
but in the interim,

806
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,513
you're in a part of a school system that
sells you a thousand ways that you're 

807
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,453
being victimized and people as opposed 
to going into work are wearing pussy 

808
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:05,040
hats and protesting a fair and 
reelection.

809
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,680
I do agree those aspects of the 
education system,

810
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:10,380
they're hugely disempower aganda.
Fair enough.

811
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,273
Like disempowering to ordinary people.
I think we do disagree on some of the 

812
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:16,830
solutions.
Now see,

813
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,830
imagine this like you when you were like
14.

814
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:20,664
You've got the Anorexia and you don't.
You can't get therapeutic help because 

815
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:28,150
you're too bloody clever.
What do we do in the instance of a,

816
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:28,920
a,
a,

817
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,120
a woman or go that suffering from 
anorexia and it doesn't have your drive.

818
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,550
What happens in this situation?
This is a person.

819
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,030
Wouldn't you agree that requires help,
compassion,

820
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,260
love,
support,

821
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:44,190
and who do you propose should provide to
that?

822
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,010
Hopefully her parents.
What if her parents,

823
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:49,560
what do you think the government's going
to just create programs for anorexics to

824
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:50,750
go to places.
I mean if,

825
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,653
if an anorexic seeks help,
six therapeutical help and they have to 

826
00:37:54,421 --> 00:37:55,860
go so bad.

827
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,690
If the government did that,
to me,

828
00:37:57,691 --> 00:38:00,480
it's ridiculous.
It's so ridiculous idea,

829
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:03,390
but it just depends on bailing out 
banks.

830
00:38:03,391 --> 00:38:08,040
Why can't we bail out some anorexia?
Not Bailing out the banks.

831
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,323
The government is not God.
They are not the solution to all your 

832
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:12,630
problems.
Families,

833
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:14,190
the community,
your friends,

834
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,170
things of that nature.
People forgot about that whole thing.

835
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:16,981
That happens,
right?

836
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:18,570
Where like,
where's the girl going to go?

837
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,463
Does she have parents?
Is there anyone before you start 

838
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:25,230
worshiping the government to fix it?
What am I going to do?

839
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,243
I don't have any money in my account.
Is there a government program that will 

840
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:29,730
fix it?
What am I going to do?

841
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,790
I have anorexia is Erica.
This is what's wrong with the world.

842
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:34,830
People don't remember light before 
government was.

843
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,990
I'm astonished by is your belief that 
the government is.

844
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,200
He's so friendly.
Benevolence,

845
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:47,930
go to one that wants to know.
I don't believe in that machine.

846
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,860
Empowering conditioning.
You want to grow it.

847
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:57,110
You don't walk around with their binders
and they'll do inspection.

848
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:03,790
Seriously.
You agree with that?

849
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,370
I thought,
that's not my thing.

850
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,930
I don't have polished anorexic programs 
for government.

851
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,190
We just created from a list.
We're touching.

852
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,050
Taxis are going up considerably for my 
cuddly,

853
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:14,884
cozy anorexia program and we need a 
further 10 percent for little putting 

854
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:22,690
them pie truck epics shut down in the 
dumps.

855
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,673
Heroin all day,
but this used to be a thing communities 

856
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,103
used to not think.
This individualistic culture is in 

857
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:32,374
itself.
Destroying the principles are spiritual 

858
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,043
human level of community.
Do you not think when people see this 

859
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,880
economic inequality,
this disparity?

860
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:41,980
I'm not talking about height in your 
little rich friend,

861
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:43,270
Lola,
Belle or wherever it was.

862
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,650
You went round and see her nanny and 
what infuriated by but for,

863
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,790
oh well,
maybe one day I'll have my own nanny.

864
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,803
Do you not think that economic 
inequality creates in a human being a 

865
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:54,550
sense of injustice,
of unfairness?

866
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,473
Because people.
Do you know what Kandis that 90 percent 

867
00:39:58,061 --> 00:39:59,440
of people that are rich,
do you know why they're rich?

868
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,780
They was born rich.
You're going to tell you something.

869
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:04,750
I think that economic disparity creates 
that feeling,

870
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:05,584
but at a fundamental understanding of 
economics can tell you know that most 

871
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,830
people that are rich are born rich.
He's not like there's a tiny minority of

872
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:12,664
people that are like you that come from 
a poor background and managed to 

873
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:17,200
overcome it,
and this is what's a pro I problem.

874
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:18,034
I've noticed with a lot of great people 
is they've sort of belief that their 

875
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:24,640
greatness is something that can be 
replicated and I don't think it can.

876
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,620
I see,
so I believe in the individual you don't

877
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,753
believe are differences,
but the primary goal of the individual 

878
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,980
should be to serve the community.
I,

879
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:37,981
I do not believe that the primary goal 
of individual fields,

880
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:39,940
so you're,
you're just,

881
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,340
you're just counting the human spirit.
Now I'm saying that's all there is.

882
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:46,740
Let me ask you a quick no,
there's not in a humanity.

883
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,730
Think of animals in the wild.
Even have to go to humanity.

884
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:50,230
We can just think about animals in the 
wild.

885
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:51,520
What is our human instinct?
Okay?

886
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:54,670
Are you going to make sure that everyone
on this block is fed?

887
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:56,440
Before you feed yourself?
Do you go around and say,

888
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,363
Hey,
have you had breakfast this morning at 

889
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,720
breakfast this morning?
Hey,

890
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,480
how are you going to make sure you're.
And if you have any,

891
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:04,390
if you have an excess,
of course you're going to do the humans.

892
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,283
Human condition in our incentives are 
going to be to want to help you mold 

893
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:08,624
tool one of the richest,
the 15 people on the planet have got as 

894
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:15,370
much cumulative welfare's,
the poorest $5 million,

895
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,730
but your glass.
No,

896
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:16,951
no,
no,

897
00:41:16,951 --> 00:41:17,171
no,
no,

898
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:18,040
no.
Okay.

899
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:18,761
Okay.
Excuse me.

900
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:19,594
First and foremost,
you're talking about literally point 

901
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,631
zero,
zero,

902
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:23,291
zero,
zero.

903
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:25,540
One percent of the world is what I'm 
talking about.

904
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,120
Okay,
and what are they preaching?

905
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,983
What do they want?
Socialism so that nobody else has the 

906
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:31,810
opportunity to become what they've 
become.

907
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,040
They're are the ones that are pushing.

908
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,133
Are you kidding?
George Soros doesn't want socialist 

909
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:38,894
policies.
Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the 

910
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,420
world,
doesn't want socialist policies.

911
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,523
They want to make sure that no one else 
has the opportunity to get to language 

912
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,500
because what we do,
here's what my socialism looks like,

913
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,873
tight Jeff Bezos as well from him,
except for a reasonable stipend for him 

914
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,960
to live on something that you can have 
10 million a year or something,

915
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:00,650
tax Amazon to the ground so that.
So,

916
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:05,360
so the rich people pay for 85 percent of
all of the taxes.

917
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:09,110
You think they should pay for even more?
That's that's fact.

918
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,430
That's fact.
Yes.

919
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,950
Don't tell that's a fact.
The top 10 percent pay for 85 percent of

920
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:16,784
all the taxes.
When people say they're going to raise 

921
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:18,530
their taxes more,
I'm just like,

922
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:20,600
how much more should we just say just 
pay for all the taxes.

923
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,870
I say I say this,
but there is no.

924
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,704
When you.
You were about to use an example from 

925
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:30,140
the natural world and I'm in.
No,

926
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:30,974
I was going to say the instinct and when
you're in when you're in the natural 

927
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:34,790
world is that you feed your family 
first.

928
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:39,360
You're not the idea that social goes 
against the natural order are we're,

929
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,203
we're in a world of sort of accumulation
and access and I don't think he's even 

930
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:44,900
working.
I wonder about.

931
00:42:44,901 --> 00:42:45,734
So if I want.
Because you could say where do you draw 

932
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:49,220
the line?
Because I'm like,

933
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,690
look at me.
I've got money now.

934
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,850
I'm not poor anymore and I'm not going 
right.

935
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:53,684
I'll just take everything.
That's the thing that I do agree with 

936
00:42:56,391 --> 00:42:57,224
when I see you like sort of right wing 
commentators talk like they talk about 

937
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:02,380
people that are in a image from the left
and like,

938
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,253
well,
why don't you put some refugees in your 

939
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:04,640
house?

940
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,473
Why don't you give up your money?
And the reason is because people are 

941
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:08,624
selfish and in all of us,
there is a kind of battle between some 

942
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:13,740
of my impulses.
Candice are,

943
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:17,570
I just want to.
I just want pleasure and fun and I don't

944
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:22,070
care about anything except myself that's
in me as strong,

945
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,880
but I personally think I don't feel good
when I lived that way.

946
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:29,120
There are consequences for me and there 
were consequences for other others.

947
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,013
So I kind of want to live within systems
that encourage collective and communal 

948
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:37,610
values instead of we're talking about 
theft.

949
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,620
Maybe we don't have to go out demanding 
that people give up.

950
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:41,270
Their stuff is theft.
But it sounds pretty.

951
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:42,104
When you say storage incentives,
now when the government comes in demand 

952
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:49,250
to someone else,
you keep translating what I'm saying.

953
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,020
No,
you're not helping me,

954
00:43:51,021 --> 00:43:52,700
Yo.
He's talking about that.

955
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,360
You're translating what I'm saying into 
rhetoric that you can argue with.

956
00:43:56,361 --> 00:44:01,090
Create a straw man of my words as we go.
So you know that that's.

957
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,650
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying.

958
00:44:03,651 --> 00:44:06,590
I'm not saying I'm not espousing the 
values of big government.

959
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,250
I'm not saying that there's any 
political party that currently exists in

960
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:14,330
any way represents my views.
I'm just asking if in politics,

961
00:44:14,331 --> 00:44:15,164
both personally and collectively,
there's room for a little more 

962
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:20,780
compassionate and love on,
whilst I agree with your,

963
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:21,231
uh,
the,

964
00:44:21,231 --> 00:44:22,010
the,
uh,

965
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:22,843
that there was something easy to 
fetishize about individual achievements 

966
00:44:26,191 --> 00:44:29,000
that let in your own case or wherever we
see greatness.

967
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,580
We can't take that example of the 
ability of the individual

968
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,630
to overcome adversity to condemn people 
that haven't been able to.

969
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:39,990
But where is there a role then for 
compassion and kindness?

970
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:42,780
I'm not saying there's a big government 
and take away from your politics.

971
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:45,210
So my thing is that the cock of the 
conversation could be,

972
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,340
should be completely separate.
Americans give $500,

973
00:44:48,341 --> 00:44:50,500
billion in charity every single year.
Okay?

974
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,980
It has been proven that when you lower 
the tax rate,

975
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:53,814
when you,
when you government stays out of our 

976
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:55,734
paycheck,
we actually give more that we're 

977
00:44:57,091 --> 00:44:57,924
inclined to you.
If you have more money and you're able 

978
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:00,144
to do it,
of course you want to give and you want 

979
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:02,820
to help.
When the government is saying,

980
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,850
we're going to tax your business,
if you're successful,

981
00:45:04,851 --> 00:45:07,800
you're going to get taxed more.
What is the incentive for you to want to

982
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:08,720
jump in?
Build a business?

983
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,560
If you know that you're going to be 
penalized for it,

984
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,270
you're going to be penalized for 
success.

985
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,190
That's why we believe in limited 
government.

986
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:17,100
I say we obviously I work for an 
organization turning point USA.

987
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,553
Well,
it's all about winning banding and 

988
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,220
Turning Point USA.
We're launching in the UK,

989
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,110
the UK.
That's what this whole trip is about.

990
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,593
Launching,
turning point and like turning point is 

991
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,643
what do you want us to turn to?
We as conservative principles taught in 

992
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:34,950
the school system because the kids are 
learning this lolly Dolly,

993
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:35,784
merry go round.
The world's going to be purple and and 

994
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:38,064
we're all going to have lollipops in the
school systems and then possibly from 

995
00:45:41,101 --> 00:45:41,934
your podcasts.
I guess I haven't watched enough 

996
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:45,450
episodes.
I'm the and it's just not.

997
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:45,930
It's,
it's,

998
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:46,900
it's the truest,
the,

999
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,743
the economic model of,
of letting people find success because 

1000
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:52,080
they're willing to work hard.
If you don't want to work hard,

1001
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:53,700
you shouldn't be rewarded.
I don't believe in that.

1002
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,481
I don't believe.
Well,

1003
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:55,314
what about the person doesn't have your 
drive or should economic systems govern 

1004
00:45:58,411 --> 00:45:59,244
the way that we live our lives?
Why is there not room for people to be 

1005
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:02,574
different?
Why is he a person who values should be 

1006
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:06,900
distilled into what's called the natural
market?

1007
00:46:06,901 --> 00:46:07,734
You can't make that go away.
You can't make that go away no matter 

1008
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:12,054
what,
in any time in the history of the world 

1009
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:15,820
where there hasn't been some give and 
some take the you cannot.

1010
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,150
You cannot do.
You can't make that go away.

1011
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,163
There's no magic wand.
You can wave that's going to make human 

1012
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:23,850
incentives and what happens in humanity 
go away.

1013
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,860
It doesn't matter how rich or how poor 
society is.

1014
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,390
There's going to be given.
There's going to be take.

1015
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,100
People are going to create natural 
markets.

1016
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:30,510
Hey,
I have three apples.

1017
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:32,850
I'll give you two apples if you give me 
this.

1018
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,430
I mean that it just happens.
This is the way the world works.

1019
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:36,543
I appreciate that.
We have certain natural impulses to try 

1020
00:46:40,851 --> 00:46:41,684
it and to cooperate as opposed to where 
you and I are arguing for sypher sleigh 

1021
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:51,500
and passionately.
Candice is on the front of a lot.

1022
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,613
Firstly,
I disagree with you that there are no 

1023
00:46:54,301 --> 00:46:58,170
social and economic factors that 
contribute,

1024
00:46:58,171 --> 00:46:59,004
for example,
to the phenomena of poverty and 

1025
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:05,310
persecution of African Americans or 
people are like in this country.

1026
00:47:05,311 --> 00:47:10,140
I think the experience of being a Muslim
is probably difficult because of the way

1027
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:13,050
Islam is reported about it.
That doesn't mean that,

1028
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:13,884
you know,
I don't see that there's this thing 

1029
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:16,134
called terrorism,
but that in itself is somewhat 

1030
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:19,434
underwritten by the colonial project.
It's like you sort of deny that history 

1031
00:47:22,261 --> 00:47:23,081
has happened.
No,

1032
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:25,980
I'm not denying that's happened.
I'm just denying that I live in history.

1033
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,490
I don't live in history.
I didn't go to prison.

1034
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,770
That's a variant.
This.

1035
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,973
This is what people

1036
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,560
harp on that and this is why they want 
you to focus on this.

1037
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:34,000
When you're in school,
look at what happened.

1038
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:34,990
That's why you're oppressed.
No,

1039
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:35,824
it's not.
Black people were actually outpacing 

1040
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,840
white Americans in the 19 fifties under 
Jim Crow.

1041
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,793
In terms of economic growth,
until we implemented the welfare 

1042
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:45,034
programs,
we were outpacing them were there were 

1043
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:48,220
businesses because our families were 
together.

1044
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:50,140
There was the divorce rates isn't what 
it was.

1045
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:51,700
People were married.
Our families were together.

1046
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,350
We had jobs.
We have starting businesses.

1047
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,570
My grandfather did better than my father
did.

1048
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,853
Okay.
My grandfather grew up in a segregated 

1049
00:47:57,461 --> 00:47:58,450
south.
How did he do that?

1050
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,450
Because there wasn't all of this crazy 
nonsense.

1051
00:48:01,451 --> 00:48:02,284
He never took welfare.
There wasn't all this government 

1052
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:04,204
regulation.
He started his own business and that is 

1053
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:06,394
how you create a successful individual.
My grandfather never ever once 

1054
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:09,790
considered himself to be a victim.

1055
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:10,623
He doesn't.
He doesn't think as you play the victim 

1056
00:48:11,831 --> 00:48:14,470
game.
Anecdotal examples of individual.

1057
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:15,580
I'm not.
I'm not,

1058
00:48:15,581 --> 00:48:17,830
but I'm telling you that our system of 
government,

1059
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:18,664
I don't think you can realistically 
argue that the removal of welfare will 

1060
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:22,294
make people go on to become a gauguin 
now because I think they're all you can 

1061
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,540
say because it's not anecdotal.
It's,

1062
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:28,060
it's a fact.
The sign arguing.

1063
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:28,903
If black people were doing better under 
Jim crow economically than we're doing 

1064
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:31,900
today,
how is that possible?

1065
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,160
Explain it to me.
I want to learn.

1066
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:38,170
I think the same way that you're saying 
that people have an automatic impulse to

1067
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:39,004
trade.
I think we also have an automatic 

1068
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:41,464
impulse to help one another and I think 
that what maybe it's happened over the 

1069
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,570
last,
I don't know,

1070
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:47,403
hundred years perhaps is part of sort of
a post colonial thing is that there's 

1071
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:51,814
been such disparity,
such bifurcation of world that there's 

1072
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:55,843
like an impoverished class that are 
forgotten and I would say the deeply 

1073
00:49:00,551 --> 00:49:01,384
underserved for me,
I'm not qualified to talk on the issue 

1074
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:05,620
of race,
but for me intuitively,

1075
00:49:05,621 --> 00:49:07,510
a lot of what you say is God.

1076
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,373
I know that some black people were 
really offended by it and hurt by and 

1077
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,070
feel that is a denial.
Why aren't qualified to talk about race?

1078
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:18,760
Because I've had no personal experience 
of being a black person.

1079
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:20,970
I've never,
no one's ever used the n word.

1080
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,320
Doesn't mean you can't qualify.
Talk about race.

1081
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,120
Talk about anything.
Matter of fact,

1082
00:49:25,121 --> 00:49:27,840
I mean 90 percent of the things I say 
I'm just making up as I go along,

1083
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:29,953
but like,
um,

1084
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,790
but my fact is my factories is the same 
way that I don't know about other female

1085
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:34,624
experiences.
This is what I know what it's like to 

1086
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:36,154
be.
I do know what it's like to feel 

1087
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:38,560
oppressed.
I do know it's like to feel,

1088
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:39,394
not heard.
I do know what it's like to feel 

1089
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:44,650
vulnerable and I do feel as a person 
that can be quite rapacious,

1090
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,140
quite greedy,
quite individualistic.

1091
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:48,003
But when I live within systems that 
encourage those aspects of my nature by 

1092
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:51,694
saying,
look,

1093
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:54,280
you make your own luck in life.
If you're willing to work hard,

1094
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:56,260
you can become anything no matter where 
you're from.

1095
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,213
In a sense,
my life journey has been that from an 

1096
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,300
ordinary working class family in Essex,
single parent family,

1097
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,550
and now whoop de Doo.
I'm rich,

1098
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:07,200
but that has not left me thinking,
fuck you everyone else.

1099
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:10,540
But it's not like it's so I want,
I want to drive.

1100
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,490
I want to drive this point home because 
it is.

1101
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,280
You used to be more in on the Hollywood 
scene in La,

1102
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,313
but this is why when these leftist 
politicians want to sell these ideas 

1103
00:50:19,871 --> 00:50:20,704
that are essentially just going to do to
make sure that nobody has an 

1104
00:50:22,421 --> 00:50:23,254
opportunity,
but everybody's married to the 

1105
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:26,320
government,
they turned to Hollywood because it's so

1106
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:28,100
easy to make you feel guilty.

1107
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:28,963
I'm not them guy anymore,
but it's so easy to make people like 

1108
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:32,500
you.
You could still say that you're.

1109
00:50:32,501 --> 00:50:33,334
You're in the sphere of influencers.
Hollywood influence as you started your 

1110
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:38,270
career as an actor,
right?

1111
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:39,104
I mean,
so you could still say it's so easy to 

1112
00:50:40,521 --> 00:50:43,940
make them feel guilty because most of 
them aren't really politically savvy.

1113
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:45,510
They can't have even a discussion that 
we're having.

1114
00:50:45,511 --> 00:50:46,344
We have no idea what's going on,
but they know that they feel so guilty 

1115
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:51,290
about being wealthy that I can come to 
you and I can say to you,

1116
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,900
feel guilty about being white because 
people make them feel guilty.

1117
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:55,490
I'll been welcomed.
They don't understand economics.

1118
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:57,290
They don't realize that they provide 
jobs.

1119
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:58,303
Okay.
When Kim Kardashian became Kim 

1120
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:00,921
Kardashians,
oh,

1121
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:03,680
should she feel guilty about that?
How many people are now employed because

1122
00:51:03,681 --> 00:51:04,790
of the Kardashian Empire?

1123
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,410
How many people are employed because of 
twitter?

1124
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,333
You know,
because Jack Dorsey created twitter and 

1125
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,793
they feel guilty about it.
Why do you feel you provide 

1126
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,150
opportunities for people to get jobs?
As human beings,

1127
00:51:17,151 --> 00:51:17,984
we should aspire to greater goals than 
simply fulfilling a predetermined 

1128
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,453
economic growth,
but I worshiping continually are the 

1129
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:30,190
older of finance we must do better and 
we must look for best solution.

1130
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:32,420
I don't know if you do you believe in 
God,

1131
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:33,800
right?
And what is it?

1132
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:34,634
Belief in God if it's not a century,
the belief that underneath hatred is 

1133
00:51:38,211 --> 00:51:39,044
love and underneath the individual is 
oneness and that what we do to one 

1134
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:45,590
another we do to ourselves and vice 
versa,

1135
00:51:45,591 --> 00:51:48,940
that we need to create systems that are 
reflective of our benevolence.

1136
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,150
Kindness.
We don't know if you want to be good and

1137
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:53,984
you want to be benevolent,
you can exercise that in your personal 

1138
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:55,790
life as well.

1139
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:56,623
You and I are discussing politics.
What you've done is that you've blended 

1140
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:01,550
in your mind that politics and goodness 
in oneness,

1141
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,770
all she'd go together.
Hell No.

1142
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,753
Okay.
There is no such thing as a good 

1143
00:52:05,571 --> 00:52:07,190
government.
That's why we want it limited.

1144
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,790
The idea that government is not going to
become corrupt when you exercise these,

1145
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:11,743
these,
these practices of goodness and the and 

1146
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,210
that's what they do.
They sell to the public,

1147
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,313
we're are going to be good for you and 
we're going to extract all of your 

1148
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:18,980
dollars and everyone is going to be 
equal.

1149
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:19,873
Equally poor.
Incredibly naive thing to say and I'm 

1150
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:22,634
startled that you've said it.
The reason that they want government to 

1151
00:52:24,861 --> 00:52:29,510
be impeded because easier to make money 
when there's huge deregulation.

1152
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:30,344
That's why there was the 2008 crash 
because the previous 20 years they'd 

1153
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:33,663
been loaded.
Loads of the regulation under the 

1154
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,320
Clinton in her life for me.

1155
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,041
You know,
they all,

1156
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:37,874
they all end up in the same basket.
So you're admitting that government is 

1157
00:52:41,571 --> 00:52:43,970
corrupt and yet you think that 
government is solution to solve crime.

1158
00:52:43,971 --> 00:52:46,660
Government different.
I'm not talking about God.

1159
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,490
You want me to talk to you because I 
actually think that,

1160
00:52:49,491 --> 00:52:50,324
you know,
because we are seemingly from so far 

1161
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:57,020
apart,
there we have an an an odd unity in that

1162
00:52:57,021 --> 00:53:01,580
we both agree that government as it 
currently exists is a order,

1163
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:04,160
I want to say unacceptable,
ineffective,

1164
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:05,980
negative,
malevolent.

1165
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,003
You think the solution is a different 
kind of government and you think the 

1166
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,310
solution is to give you more power to 
the already powerful.

1167
00:53:13,311 --> 00:53:17,270
I think the government only functioned 
as administrative individual branches,

1168
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,040
national corporation to the individual.
No,

1169
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:21,140
no.
I never said give more individual,

1170
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,590
more powerful individual.
I don't want to give up.

1171
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:25,800
I don't want to give up all of my rights

1172
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,780
to a government.
That's arbitrary.

1173
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:29,880
That's going to tell me how to live.
It tells me what to say.

1174
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,500
I don't think anyone's gonna take away 
your rights.

1175
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:33,150
How could they what?
But what?

1176
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:35,580
I'm interested in,
what I'm interested in,

1177
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:37,980
either of you need to call anybody.
You are enough as you are.

1178
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:38,963
What I'm interested in is what I believe
is the government are the sort of 

1179
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:45,660
bureaucratic arm of corporations,
transnational corporations,

1180
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:46,494
and I think like you look at sort of any
government that tries to impose serious 

1181
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:50,664
restrictions on the way that Amazon 
trade and the way that Amazon are tax 

1182
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,400
would suffer.
We can't do that in this country.

1183
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:57,234
Like when are you going to win?
There's talk of a sort of a more left 

1184
00:53:58,711 --> 00:54:01,740
wing government getting into power.
The city's flex his muscles,

1185
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,890
everyone starts to brick.
It was like,

1186
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,060
you know,
shit themselves to sort of terrified,

1187
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:06,330
right?

1188
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:09,700
So you know,
for me it like a centralized bipartisan.

1189
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:10,623
The Democratic governments as they 
currently exist are meaningless and 

1190
00:54:13,441 --> 00:54:15,150
ineffectual.
I completely agree with you there,

1191
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,980
but,
but my concern is,

1192
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:21,270
is that we need to find new ways of 
curbing the power of big business.

1193
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:22,104
I'm not talking about some lovely bloody
flourish to making their way in life or 

1194
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:30,020
people that are entrepreneurial that is 
limited,

1195
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,033
but now that's why we like trump is he's
disruptive because he's talking about 

1196
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:35,064
it.
We're talking about Google should be 

1197
00:54:35,761 --> 00:54:36,690
broken up.
It's a monopoly.

1198
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,220
I don't agree with monopolies,
right?

1199
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,410
Google is a monopoly.
It's a worldwide monopoly.

1200
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:43,290
I have said it vocally a thousand times.
Google should be broken up.

1201
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,790
Amazon is prompt,
problematic.

1202
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:45,624
These are things that issues that trump 
is tackling and that's why the 

1203
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:52,500
establishment with naive as Mark 
Zuckerberg,

1204
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:53,680
you know,
testifying these,

1205
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,533
he starting to attack this because he 
understands that what you're talking 

1206
00:54:56,491 --> 00:54:57,324
about is real.

1207
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,210
The Latin and the right combined.
Right?

1208
00:54:59,211 --> 00:54:59,761
Um,
and,

1209
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:01,380
and that's why I say I'm not a 
Republican.

1210
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,630
I don't want to be associated with the 
swamp Republicans.

1211
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,470
I'm a or have a leftist who pretend that
they're,

1212
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,890
you know,
they care about people,

1213
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:11,010
but in reality of this extracting 
dollars and power for themselves as they

1214
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:14,460
grow government to make sure that just 
the bureaucrats enrich their pockets.

1215
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:16,043
That's what trump is disrupting.
It's hard for people to process that 

1216
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:20,190
because trump is wealthy,
but that is what he's doing.

1217
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,620
I mean,
if you look at every policy he's made in

1218
00:55:22,621 --> 00:55:23,454
terms of all the activities implemented,
that is why there is a war on him and 

1219
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,083
all out war in terms of the media.
The same is happening in other 

1220
00:55:29,461 --> 00:55:30,294
countries,
you sort of populist movements are 

1221
00:55:30,971 --> 00:55:32,250
starting to arise.
Um,

1222
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,093
and I support them in Italy and Brazil 
look like most people who are wealthy 

1223
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,813
because the vagina that he emerged from,
and then he did very well on top of 

1224
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:44,280
that.

1225
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,150
So I mean to describe what he's done,
what he's built is,

1226
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,840
is not good.
You know,

1227
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:53,870
he hasn't been paying and just maintain 
fail before they find success.

1228
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,050
You really like him,
but most people fail because this is,

1229
00:55:58,051 --> 00:56:00,300
this is what I don't like either people 
say because you fail.

1230
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,970
No,
it's pretty funny.

1231
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,110
He's hilarious.
I mean,

1232
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,790
if the people that can enjoy trump,
I feel bad for that means he's pointedly

1233
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,120
hilarious.
He says things that everybody's thinking

1234
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,760
and it's calling out people that have 
been impossibly corrupt.

1235
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,970
We're going to say lock her up.
Hillary should be in prison.

1236
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,220
Most Americans feel that way.
What she did to Haiti alone,

1237
00:56:17,221 --> 00:56:19,230
what the Clinton Foundation did to Haiti
alone,

1238
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:21,690
they should all be locked out.
I'm no fan of the Clintons.

1239
00:56:21,691 --> 00:56:23,920
I'll tell you that now.
He had the balls to say it.

1240
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:24,130
What

1241
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,510
politician?
Everybody else's,

1242
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,500
oh,
but it's the Clinton.

1243
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:28,210
That's the dynasty in the bushes.
It's,

1244
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:29,560
you know,
we can't say these things.

1245
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:31,270
Trump just says it.
They're all corrupt.

1246
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:33,670
So you liked that you liked these as 
sort of a rabble rouser.

1247
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:37,600
But the thing that I would concern me is
that I feel that our,

1248
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:38,434
um,
social systems will need to look beyond 

1249
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,833
terrible handouts.
I wonder it world where sort of your 

1250
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:46,780
ideology was realized as I'm starting to
understand as I listened to you,

1251
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:49,030
like the,
the sort of the individual,

1252
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:49,973
uh,
on impeded unimpaired reaching for 

1253
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:54,214
Nietzschean glory.
What happens to people that are not in 

1254
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,240
Dow with the facilities to achieve that?
Because some,

1255
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,760
we are existing on a spectrum as you 
say.

1256
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:07,780
Some people just need a bit of help and 
a bit of love to tell the truth.

1257
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:10,060
If I hadn't been helped again to a 
treatment center,

1258
00:57:10,061 --> 00:57:11,470
I think I'll still be on drugs.

1259
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,220
If I didn't have other people helping me
to stay clean one day at a time,

1260
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:18,690
I think I might relapse.
I'm held invisibly,

1261
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,000
held by relationships with people that 
are kind and compassionate to me.

1262
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,893
And if it wasn't presented as if the 
government shrinks as your friend just 

1263
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:27,583
got out the government though,
although you just set that someone's 

1264
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:31,980
going to have to break up these 
monopolies and I don't know,

1265
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,300
you think it's going to do that.
Goldman Sachs government,

1266
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,320
that's what this company,
our country was founded upon.

1267
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:43,660
Just accidentally call it a company.
I'm sorry we're keeping the best company

1268
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:49,840
in the world.
But like,

1269
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,120
you know,
Britain was essentially just the sort of

1270
00:57:52,121 --> 00:57:56,130
a front for the colonizing powers of the
east India tea company.

1271
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:56,973
And I believe in limited government that
I believe that government should come 

1272
00:57:59,051 --> 00:57:59,870
because we learned from,
uh,

1273
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:00,600
you know,
uh,

1274
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,080
the 19th,
late,

1275
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,390
late 19th century,
early,

1276
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:04,303
early 20th century that once if 
businesses run and they'll eventually 

1277
00:58:08,201 --> 00:58:09,040
create monopolies.

1278
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,873
And that's what we're seeing,
I think happened with Google and the 

1279
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,673
function of the government is to protect
us against that so that there's 

1280
00:58:13,211 --> 00:58:14,044
opportunities for the little guy and 
small businesses to get in and to 

1281
00:58:16,181 --> 00:58:18,190
compete with these bigger companies.
Um,

1282
00:58:18,191 --> 00:58:19,024
so I,
I can ever work on a global level now 

1283
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:24,740
with sort of the way that trade operates
and with,

1284
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:27,400
and with there being such powerful 
monoliths already in place.

1285
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:32,350
Will those powers ever yield any of 
their potency?

1286
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,840
What would make it Google?
Um,

1287
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:37,340
as in the silicon valley giants,
the,

1288
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:38,373
the Energy John.
So the forces that we know we're behind 

1289
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:44,770
the sort of the recent Middle East and 
oil wars.

1290
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:48,760
What will make those companies you to 
some of their power,

1291
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:51,250
what would do that?
What force could oppose that?

1292
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:54,540
Only the people and under what banner to
the People Unite.

1293
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,473
It's like you try to,
it feels to me that you're taking away 

1294
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:58,783
the hmm.
The capacity for human beings to unite 

1295
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:04,220
under by don't agree with divisive 
policy of your,

1296
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:04,991
this gender,
your,

1297
00:59:04,991 --> 00:59:05,824
that color.
I think we are one and we should look 

1298
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:09,580
for ways to find common connections.
I've got more,

1299
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,593
probably more in common with you even 
though there's so much different about 

1300
00:59:12,771 --> 00:59:16,050
us politically and believing in that.
We're both mouthy individually.

1301
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,233
That's exactly right.
And I agree with that and I think that 

1302
00:59:18,701 --> 00:59:20,760
that's important discussion to have,
but when I,

1303
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,490
in terms of how I use my voice

1304
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:23,443
and what I'm talking about,
I'm in the realm of politics and I 

1305
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,320
don't.
I think that the problem is,

1306
00:59:26,321 --> 00:59:30,830
is that people want to insert compassion
into the political realm too much.

1307
00:59:30,831 --> 00:59:32,360
You know,
just management will,

1308
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:37,190
is politics is not about helping human 
beings to gain access to resources.

1309
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,830
It's,
I really think that the what,

1310
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:41,630
what should be the function of a 
politician?

1311
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:44,510
What do you think that you told me 
you're the bloody expert.

1312
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:48,620
I mean they're supposed to go and what 
should it be?

1313
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,161
Right?
I mean,

1314
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:49,994
I think it's gotten to the point now 
that it just becomes about them trying 

1315
00:59:52,431 --> 00:59:54,160
to enrich their own pocket.
Should it be.

1316
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,093
I think it should be.
They are there to protect the rights of 

1317
00:59:57,351 --> 00:59:58,910
the people that have already been 
established.

1318
00:59:58,911 --> 00:59:59,744
You know,
that they are supposed to be 

1319
01:00:00,351 --> 01:00:01,184
representing their constituents,
the people that were all bloody bloody 

1320
01:00:02,691 --> 01:00:03,200
established.

1321
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,033
What about people that need help?
Making sure that their rights are 

1322
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,490
protected,
that they're able to create an ad,

1323
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,320
that they have opportunities and the 
idea that you can,

1324
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,070
that they'll still have opportunities if
you grow government is.

1325
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:15,913
It hasn't been so many times nothing.
It's killed 100 million people in the 

1326
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,190
last 100 years.
It's,

1327
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,033
it's,
it's jarring to me that we have people 

1328
01:00:24,711 --> 01:00:26,390
that are running around saying that it's
good again,

1329
01:00:26,391 --> 01:00:27,560
especially in Europe.
I mean,

1330
01:00:27,561 --> 01:00:29,720
you guys really should understand that 
social doesn't work.

1331
01:00:29,721 --> 01:00:34,360
I mean like really like what is it going
to take for your.

1332
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,920
How many times did we have to get the 
phone call and America,

1333
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:39,730
Hey,
you dare doing again.

1334
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:44,210
You will let this run because we're 
like,

1335
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:44,991
really?
Guys,

1336
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:46,430
again,
we're doing it again.

1337
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:46,821
Like,
no,

1338
01:00:46,821 --> 01:00:48,350
it's different.
This is different.

1339
01:00:48,351 --> 01:00:49,184
Jeremy Corbyn's like a democratic 
socialist who says a lot of antisemitic 

1340
01:00:52,251 --> 01:00:52,881
things,
you know,

1341
01:00:52,881 --> 01:00:53,840
it's like,
really?

1342
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,673
How many times do you guys have to.
What's it gonna take for you guys to 

1343
01:00:57,621 --> 01:00:58,670
learn your lesson?
I mean,

1344
01:00:58,671 --> 01:00:59,504
that's how I feel,
at least in America and I love my 

1345
01:01:01,101 --> 01:01:01,551
breasts.
Look,

1346
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:02,210
we,
we fight.

1347
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:04,070
We ended the wars together so that,
I mean,

1348
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:06,200
that's why we're doing tpu kegs.
It's like,

1349
01:01:06,201 --> 01:01:07,940
all right,
it's getting a little crazy again.

1350
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:08,943
Might have to step in and start some 
normal conservative principles again 

1351
01:01:11,151 --> 01:01:14,690
into the dialogue because we've got it.
It's gone crazy.

1352
01:01:14,691 --> 01:01:16,840
The socialist,
it doesn't work on crazy.

1353
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:17,693
There is no.
There is no meaningful socialism at any 

1354
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,290
level of power.
Anyway.

1355
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,290
Let's see.
Where was it?

1356
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:26,900
What do you.
What do you mean?

1357
01:01:26,901 --> 01:01:28,130
Anywhere?
Venezuela.

1358
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:29,683
What do you mean?
There's no.

1359
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,653
No.
Always banging on about 15 people live 

1360
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:35,114
there.
Don't you dare come to the United 

1361
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:38,900
States.
They're United States.

1362
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:40,720
You know,
the average citizen has last April.

1363
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,193
Have an over here.
You guys should like put me finish 

1364
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,100
whitelaw.
I'm the Venezuelan people.

1365
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:50,410
I don't think the social,
the experiments with socialism in a very

1366
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:51,283
common in Venezuela or having any 
meaningful impact on the American 

1367
01:01:54,321 --> 01:01:59,210
economy or the global economy or global 
or geopolitical power structures.

1368
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:04,390
So what I'm interested in is my friend.
Why all this macron fascist.

1369
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:06,970
He's a total.
No,

1370
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,030
no,
he's a global list.

1371
01:02:08,031 --> 01:02:09,120
He's on.
He's on a fascist.

1372
01:02:09,121 --> 01:02:10,070
The globalist.
Okay.

1373
01:02:10,071 --> 01:02:10,904
And,
and,

1374
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,833
and all of the people that stood up and 
said awful things about trump are now 

1375
01:02:14,301 --> 01:02:17,140
realizing that everything that he was 
saying was essentially right,

1376
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,133
you know,
and his people think about what's going 

1377
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:20,400
on in,
is fascinating.

1378
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,840
The far left and the far right are 
together rioting in the streets.

1379
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,330
I love that.
Think about that and why?

1380
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:29,580
Because of these things,
like what was the tipping point?

1381
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:32,220
They were hiking prices to protect the 
environment.

1382
01:02:32,221 --> 01:02:32,930
Again,
they,

1383
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:33,763
they,
they're going to tell you that they're 

1384
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:35,820
doing something to protect you,
but extracting,

1385
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:36,683
finding fun ways to extract dollars.
Now there is no jobs and people are 

1386
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:39,804
unemployed.
Every ones on welfare and government 

1387
01:02:40,981 --> 01:02:41,814
programs and on top of that.
So you asked what happens in socialism 

1388
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,140
every single time she met kronas 
associates,

1389
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:50,080
which is just bizarre to me because he's
a former social.

1390
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,760
France has been proliferating a welfare 
state since the 19 seventies.

1391
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:54,930
Okay.
And that's what it is.

1392
01:02:54,931 --> 01:02:56,880
There are people don't work in French.
They're lazy.

1393
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,070
And that's what happens in a socialist 
model.

1394
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:01,110
Everyone becomes lazy because you're 
going to say,

1395
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:04,580
if you become Richmond attacks you with,
why the hell am I going to work all,

1396
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,540
sit back and wait for the government to 
give us handouts.

1397
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,790
Oh wait,
that can't happen because now there's no

1398
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:09,660
one left.
The tax.

1399
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,610
Everybody's equally.
You guys are right.

1400
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:16,770
Socialism does call poverty crime base 
for socialism.

1401
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:18,090
If you want equality,
they will.

1402
01:03:18,091 --> 01:03:18,820
They reasonable

1403
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:19,641
what?
Look,

1404
01:03:19,641 --> 01:03:20,474
I've been a bit Glib and a bit silly at 
several points during this conversation 

1405
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:27,830
because I find you very charming and 
interesting to talk to,

1406
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:29,143
but I must say in all seriousness that 
you cannot cite any of these countries 

1407
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:38,660
as examples of socialism or socialism's 
of failures because they.

1408
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,093
Because macron is existing with 
comfortably within the framework of the 

1409
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:45,283
kind of neo,
neo liberal failings that are bringing 

1410
01:03:48,981 --> 01:03:49,814
about the current mass discontentment 
that has brought about brexit and trump 

1411
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,113
and I think that neither brexit nor 
trump will address or eight ordinary 

1412
01:04:00,351 --> 01:04:01,730
people.
One Jot.

1413
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:02,623
Not that I disagree with people who are 
voting for Brexit or for voting for 

1414
01:04:04,821 --> 01:04:05,654
trump because I agree with them that 
things weren't going well for ordinary 

1415
01:04:08,751 --> 01:04:11,060
people and I understand their 
dissatisfaction,

1416
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,163
but what I don't see how the solution to
the problems of ordinary people will 

1417
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:20,120
ever be to give more power to the 
already powerful.

1418
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:24,140
I wouldn't confront you hugely over the 
government.

1419
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,720
I think you and I both do not trust 
government.

1420
01:04:26,721 --> 01:04:27,554
I'm,
I'm beginning to work out where people 

1421
01:04:28,851 --> 01:04:31,620
from the left and where they can,
uh,

1422
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:33,830
collaborate,
collude and agree.

1423
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:34,813
But obviously the,
the main problem for me is that I feel 

1424
01:04:37,101 --> 01:04:41,630
that all politics ultimately has to be 
an expression of human goodness.

1425
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:44,870
And whilst it is ultimately about 
pragmatism,

1426
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:49,710
what is the point in being pragmatic?
If we're not symbol timelessly,

1427
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:52,940
being loving and beautiful,
what is our aim?

1428
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:56,540
What is the optimum?
What are we trying to achieve?

1429
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:57,523
And surely that must be a fair and just 
world where the brilliant get to thrive 

1430
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,800
and the vulnerable are loved and taken 
care of.

1431
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:07,653
A shaming that there are still 
categories such as the vulnerable and 

1432
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:11,803
the brilliance.
I love everything you said is it sounds 

1433
01:05:13,431 --> 01:05:14,264
totally utopia,

1434
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,630
but it's just not pragmatic.
Well,

1435
01:05:15,631 --> 01:05:17,510
that's what people say.
It is.

1436
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:22,990
Not Conservative.
Can created government for me right now.

1437
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,520
What are you going to do?
Oh,

1438
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:27,040
let's do it.
Let's do it right now.

1439
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:27,970
No,
I mean seriously,

1440
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:28,804
because this is how.
This is how socialism gets sold because 

1441
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,760
it sounds good.
Hey,

1442
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:38,970
but that is a socialist socialist pitch.
That's that's what they be socialist,

1443
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:40,181
right?
Amount.

1444
01:05:40,181 --> 01:05:45,130
Saying the Alexandria Ocozzio Cortez.
I just want a world where everybody,

1445
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:48,280
the minimum wage is $30 an hour and I 
don't know who's going to pay for it.

1446
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:49,720
Doesn't matter.
We're going to talk practically.

1447
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:50,763
It's going to feel good.
We're going to just tax the rich and 

1448
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:53,554
we're going to take from this person.
You can only take from the rich for so 

1449
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:58,120
much.
Essentially what you have to focus on is

1450
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,890
creating opportunities for every single 
person to become rich,

1451
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:02,703
systemic inequality and a massive 
philosophical disjunct in the fact that 

1452
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:08,020
when there was,
when all these systems,

1453
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:10,180
these systems that you say are going to 
take care of us,

1454
01:06:10,181 --> 01:06:11,680
they're going to create trickle down 
wealth,

1455
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:14,200
but when they did ultimately inevitably 
fail,

1456
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:17,380
they would,
but when they do fail,

1457
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,800
they are bailed out by the people.

1458
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,990
That's the people,
ordinary people,

1459
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,800
so why should I trust those?
Shouldn't,

1460
01:06:26,801 --> 01:06:29,230
but why don't you keep telling us that 
we should grow government.

1461
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:34,440
I'm not telling you to centralization.
I do think that we need programs to help

1462
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:40,230
people know what I'm thinking.
The words are coming.

1463
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:43,690
Let's do it.
We're building your community.

1464
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,510
Okay,
but that's your position.

1465
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,300
That's a conservative position.
We're saying all of these programs,

1466
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:51,200
entities might need some assistance to 
you.

1467
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:53,440
I think you just don't realize that 
you're a conservative.

1468
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:58,070
Listen,
you are a conservative because you were.

1469
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:01,780
You're identifying the same problems and
you're agreeing the solution not be more

1470
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,150
candidates,
but you've backed socialist candidates,

1471
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:11,170
which makes no sense.
Everything lines up biggest trouble.

1472
01:07:11,171 --> 01:07:12,200
I go and we're saying,
oh,

1473
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:14,920
don't vote for anyone because I think 
it's all total bullshit and it ends with

1474
01:07:14,921 --> 01:07:17,050
the power ends up in the hands of the 
same people anyway,

1475
01:07:17,051 --> 01:07:21,690
and it was as if I kicked the football,
it really prime minister,

1476
01:07:21,691 --> 01:07:22,524
the Guardian,
The Guardian as a matter of fact shot 

1477
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,400
and were probably the worst job that 
sort of changed their propaganda.

1478
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:32,843
Yeah,
they're just literally propaganda by 

1479
01:07:33,661 --> 01:07:36,790
finger that,
but why I would say that the differences

1480
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:38,620
between some of these things that we're 
arguing about,

1481
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:39,454
the distinctions are negligible.
I think that what's required is a kind 

1482
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:44,200
of radicalism,
radical change,

1483
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:49,440
but what makes me nervous about some of 
the stuff you say candice,

1484
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,153
is it's kind of lack of empathy.
I can't help but see that teenage girl 

1485
01:07:55,631 --> 01:08:00,610
with Anorexia not being treated with 
love and care and nurture.

1486
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:04,080
What?
That you get what I'm saying.

1487
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:09,940
Does that make it more likely that 
people feel loving and compassionate?

1488
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,030
I don't think that's the role of the 
government.

1489
01:08:12,031 --> 01:08:14,010
I think that's the role of the family.
So if we were.

1490
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:16,160
This is not about politics and we 
started

1491
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,150
talking about posting done raising kids,
but I was so compassionate.

1492
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,370
Industrial post technological capitalist
societies.

1493
01:08:23,371 --> 01:08:26,610
The family is no longer an all powerful 
unit.

1494
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,350
There is already such massive 
inequality.

1495
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:29,184
I'm not.
I'm not clever enough to argue with you 

1496
01:08:31,501 --> 01:08:32,334
about whether or not big government 
centralization is problematic as you 

1497
01:08:36,211 --> 01:08:37,044
say,
but what I do know is unimpeded 

1498
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:39,683
capitalist power is the biggest 
contribution to the problems we have in 

1499
01:08:43,591 --> 01:08:44,220
the world.
Okay?

1500
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,950
Actually no,
so socialism has has killed.

1501
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:51,060
It's not capitalism killed 100.
We don't know.

1502
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:54,450
It was harder to.
Harder to curate the information.

1503
01:08:54,451 --> 01:08:55,284
We don't know how many people are killed
in the various colonial wars that 

1504
01:08:57,271 --> 01:08:59,970
America has been engaged with ever since
the Second World War.

1505
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:00,993
All of those economic,
close ideological component of that is 

1506
01:09:03,991 --> 01:09:04,580
because,
and,

1507
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:07,350
and I will agree with you here,
the idea that you're going to go and you

1508
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:09,450
don't have natural resources because I 
don't know,

1509
01:09:09,451 --> 01:09:10,284
environment environmentally friendly.
Kids don't want you to do fracking or 

1510
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:14,490
whatever it is,
and then you go and you say,

1511
01:09:14,491 --> 01:09:15,324
well,
here's an oil rich country and we're 

1512
01:09:15,721 --> 01:09:16,710
going to go and we're going to invade 
it.

1513
01:09:16,711 --> 01:09:18,600
We're going to take things over.
I disagree.

1514
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:19,463
I disagree with all of that,
so it'd be an Itam has got to be the 

1515
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:24,290
aim.
You can't be seriously saying that Islam

1516
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:25,740
should be the aim.
Did you just shouldn't be.

1517
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:29,610
That shouldn't be the.
I literally like like that.

1518
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:30,643
Well,
I will also be the place where we all 

1519
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:37,820
can't happen.
It can't happen.

1520
01:09:37,821 --> 01:09:40,910
Human beings are always going to.
I've since the,

1521
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,780
since biblical times,
there are always going to battle.

1522
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,620
The point of the Bible is that we will 
transcend that.

1523
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:48,180
A man will transcend.
Here.

1524
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,240
We can get beyond that.
Primal desires,

1525
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:53,210
our primal desires that you're trying to
turn into systems,

1526
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,160
greed,
jealousy,

1527
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,580
conservatism.
No,

1528
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:56,900
no,
no.

1529
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:57,733
It's the opposite.
I'm saying you have to acknowledge that 

1530
01:09:58,971 --> 01:09:59,804
this exists.
This is why it's foolish when people 

1531
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,670
gave up all of your and then what 
happens?

1532
01:10:04,671 --> 01:10:05,504
What happened to Venezuela when they get
up all the rights and they sold them 

1533
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:07,934
this utopian concept that Russell brand 
loves and there's going to be flowers 

1534
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:11,954
and Venezuela and skittles and we're all
going to go to Willy Wonka everyday 

1535
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:17,690
because what happened?
Oh,

1536
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:19,230
we found out what happens when you give 
all your money,

1537
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:20,103
the government,
the government keeps it found in 

1538
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:21,150
medicine.

1539
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,010
Well,
because you know why?

1540
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:26,390
Because the government is governed by 
human beings and human beings are greedy

1541
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,770
or you know,
if you're a terrible human being,

1542
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:32,540
but when you give them all of your 
money,

1543
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:35,790
you're going to see what happens in 
times.

1544
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:38,050
Individuals,
candice,

1545
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,910
these untrammeled individuals that have 
gotten no regulation,

1546
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:41,773
well,
they're going to be different from the 

1547
01:10:42,381 --> 01:10:44,270
Venezuelan government aid government 
where they,

1548
01:10:44,271 --> 01:10:45,104
when their incentives are not to go line
their own pockets and government and 

1549
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:47,803
know that they have term limits and that
they literally are there to serve the 

1550
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:50,560
people.
Okay,

1551
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:53,450
interesting.
Then allow them to do their damn job and

1552
01:10:53,451 --> 01:10:55,700
look at these companies and say,
is this now but not Napoli?

1553
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:56,500
Yes,
it is.

1554
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,590
Break up Google will that we agree on 
that as well.

1555
01:10:59,591 --> 01:11:00,424
As long as it still works,
because I do need it mostly for my own 

1556
01:11:02,651 --> 01:11:03,590
name.
Now.

1557
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:07,143
I just need a search engine called the 
Russell brand search engine that be 

1558
01:11:10,121 --> 01:11:13,090
enough for me.
As long as I have that,

1559
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,430
you can break up that monopoly.

1560
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:15,563
Candice,
there's another thing I'm going to ask 

1561
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:18,040
you.
That thing you just said mate,

1562
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:23,240
about like a human beings are greedy and
cruel and components of humanity.

1563
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,520
Here were.
You said that that's huge for me.

1564
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,320
When you said that.
I thought it was very telling.

1565
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:30,300
I feel that that is ultimately what you 
believe.

1566
01:11:30,301 --> 01:11:33,820
I think human beings are vocally.
I do think that first time,

1567
01:11:33,821 --> 01:11:36,280
what do you think?
First off human beings do you.

1568
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,193
I'll ask you a question.
Do you think were more good or more 

1569
01:11:38,431 --> 01:11:39,810
evil?
Good.

1570
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:42,630
I think human beings are beautiful.
What do you think were born?

1571
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:43,613
Pure and good and wonderful.
You have a small child as soaps and 

1572
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:49,980
teach human beings.
Good.

1573
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:52,410
Listen,
the culture is definitely a factor,

1574
01:11:52,411 --> 01:11:54,090
but this is my point.
You've asked me a question.

1575
01:11:54,091 --> 01:11:54,924
Please allow me to out sultanates and 
says the line between good and evil 

1576
01:11:58,261 --> 01:11:59,730
runs,
not through nations,

1577
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,520
religions or creeds,
but through every human heart,

1578
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:05,310
because I know that there is darkness in
me.

1579
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:09,300
I know there is selfishness and greed 
and and like Libido,

1580
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,890
life force,
not necessarily a bad thing,

1581
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:12,060
but last,
for example,

1582
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:13,823
I know all these things exist in me,
so I need to exist within communities 

1583
01:12:17,281 --> 01:12:21,030
and systems that acknowledge that I am 
flawed and that I can fail,

1584
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:23,700
but encourage the better parts of my 
nature.

1585
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,450
For me,
that is not a kind of Venal,

1586
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:32,540
economically driven system that rewards 
kind of the pursuit of excess.

1587
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:35,363
We can.
I don't think we can ever be fulfilled 

1588
01:12:36,901 --> 01:12:37,734
by commodity.
I don't think we can ever be fulfilled 

1589
01:12:39,751 --> 01:12:40,584
through acquisition.
I think that our goals must become 

1590
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:45,090
spiritual,
but I agree with that.

1591
01:12:45,091 --> 01:12:49,530
I'm not in favor of creating banal 
Stalinist,

1592
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:50,883
a massacre factories,
but I also resent and reject the 

1593
01:12:55,891 --> 01:13:00,891
illusion of a commercial capitalist 
state where people are being underserved

1594
01:13:01,501 --> 01:13:02,334
spiritually.
People are neglected and cut off and 

1595
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:04,530
below.

1596
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:05,250
Oh,
drew Loki.

1597
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:06,083
We're with them.
We've ever been statistically things 

1598
01:13:07,931 --> 01:13:09,360
that Upi,
well,

1599
01:13:09,361 --> 01:13:13,130
I live in this world and I feel a lot of
dissatisfaction,

1600
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,580
a lot of pain.
I've been rich,

1601
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:15,414
I've been poor,
I've been in both of those worlds and I 

1602
01:13:17,491 --> 01:13:21,790
sense that there is something spiritual 
that is not being served,

1603
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:22,624
that is being neglected and I feel a 
huge part of that is living in a world 

1604
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:29,730
where the supreme ideals are 
economically driven,

1605
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:30,564
where there is a huge unfairness,
where we are ignoring the problems of 

1606
01:13:33,661 --> 01:13:34,494
the earth and to hear you talk about a 
sort of fracking and like in it simply 

1607
01:13:39,241 --> 01:13:44,241
because it is another way of serving 
conservative or capitalist goals.

1608
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:45,653
That concerns me.
Well not I brought it up because you 

1609
01:13:47,221 --> 01:13:48,054
brought up the Middle East and the 
conquest that we're going over there 

1610
01:13:50,101 --> 01:13:53,850
because he wanted their conservatism 
used to be about conserve the planet.

1611
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,830
First and foremost.
You've got to live on it.

1612
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:58,570
I don't think that in America it 
concerned me.

1613
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,470
It means used to be supply about 
conserving.

1614
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:02,304
We've got to look after the care a 
little more about the environment here 

1615
01:14:05,071 --> 01:14:05,904
than in America.
We have the like obviously the 

1616
01:14:07,321 --> 01:14:08,154
environmentalist,
but I think probably stronger here I've 

1617
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,194
noticed.
I'm not saying there's one way one is 

1618
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:12,040
wrong or one is

1619
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,240
right.
I'm just making a note here.

1620
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:14,253
How could we.
What you're talking about is that you 

1621
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:20,380
think that all that exists is politics.
Take Yoga class.

1622
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:21,583
You want some spiritual balance after 
you go to work or you go take a yoga 

1623
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:25,480
class.
You had the money to do that.

1624
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:26,491
Um,
to go.

1625
01:14:26,491 --> 01:14:28,660
Do you sit and do Koombaya and do all of
that stuff.

1626
01:14:28,661 --> 01:14:30,280
I like it all.
Family.

1627
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:31,840
It's not cynical,
but I really,

1628
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:36,190
I like getting from Yoga.
I Love Yoga.

1629
01:14:36,191 --> 01:14:37,024
I love spiritualism.
I told you I originally found you 

1630
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:41,490
because you were talking about 
spiritualism.

1631
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,333
I was like on Youtube and I remember 
just being very granted would show was 

1632
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:45,634
never seen that show before.
But you were talking about spiritual 

1633
01:14:47,231 --> 01:14:49,510
fulfillment and I agree with you on all 
of those things.

1634
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:50,583
Where we disagree is that you don't seem
to think that both of those can live at 

1635
01:14:53,261 --> 01:14:54,070
the same time.

1636
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:56,020
Like if capitalism exists in 
spiritualism,

1637
01:14:56,021 --> 01:14:56,830
die,
it's.

1638
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:57,663
No,
it doesn't.

1639
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,700
You can be spiritual and you can let 
capitalism you like it.

1640
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:02,060
A capitalist says,
I like.

1641
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:04,570
I like switches from so much I'm going 
to open a yoga studio.

1642
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:06,363
Know that is turning everything into a 
commodity like ultimate end of 

1643
01:15:10,451 --> 01:15:12,820
everything is to turn and I'm guilty of 
this.

1644
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:14,650
As soon as I like genuine,
I'm the kind of person.

1645
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:17,680
I make up a beautiful song from my door 
and Oh my God,

1646
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:19,540
I should write a children's book about 
this.

1647
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:22,780
I have that interesting.
I am an entrepreneurial person.

1648
01:15:22,781 --> 01:15:23,614
I am an individualist,
but I feel that these impulses in me 

1649
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:31,090
kind of be better utilized if they are 
in the service of others,

1650
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:32,710
so then share it.
That's what I do.

1651
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:34,510
I get spiritual fulfillment when,
when,

1652
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:37,660
when black kids from the ghettos and and
the hood,

1653
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:38,140
right?

1654
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,710
To me and say thank you so much.
Finding your perspective has transformed

1655
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:42,940
my life.
Right?

1656
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:43,863
And they say,
because I just put out something that I 

1657
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:47,980
genuinely believe in and it's backed in 
my heart and it's back to my spirit.

1658
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:50,260
Now what fulfills you might be something
different,

1659
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,213
but you determining that what people 
should like and what should dry you 

1660
01:15:53,411 --> 01:15:54,580
know,
what fulfills that are,

1661
01:15:54,581 --> 01:15:56,310
what should be compassionate.
That's that.

1662
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,420
Those are words that are subjective.
They're not objective.

1663
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:00,443
It's subjective.
I think that's true and I think I can 

1664
01:16:02,741 --> 01:16:03,574
understand why a young black children 
would be inspired by a powerful woman 

1665
01:16:09,851 --> 01:16:14,140
like you who communicates brilliantly 
and is so strong and successful,

1666
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,033
but I would imagine it may be 
disheartening to hear you disavow the 

1667
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:20,853
impact of social historical and cultural
influences on the plight of individuals 

1668
01:16:26,441 --> 01:16:30,420
and individual families to extract that.
I think he's cool,

1669
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:32,500
but I don't talk about it all the time 
doing it.

1670
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:37,060
You're condemning people in saying that 
the individual is in charge of their own

1671
01:16:37,061 --> 01:16:38,050
destiny.
You are.

1672
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:43,240
You are in the shadow of that is people 
that are responsibility of to blame.

1673
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:44,200
Yeah.
No,

1674
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,033
I.
I truly believe if people wake up and 

1675
01:16:46,661 --> 01:16:48,640
they understand that they even control 
their own destiny,

1676
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:50,600
that they can,
they will be in control of.

1677
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:52,870
That is a good point.
I think that's a good point,

1678
01:16:52,871 --> 01:16:57,871
but I do also agree that that is the 
obligation of all of us to be careful,

1679
01:16:58,481 --> 01:17:01,230
protect,
reach out to one another and I feel like

1680
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:06,530
I'm concerned by that.
I'm concerned that you feel that because

1681
01:17:07,151 --> 01:17:09,040
it's sort of like for me,
where is the love?

1682
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:11,360
What do you mean there's,
there's love.

1683
01:17:11,361 --> 01:17:12,194
In my personal life,
I don't feel bad for people that are 

1684
01:17:13,881 --> 01:17:16,430
lazy and looking for excuses.
So if that sounds,

1685
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:18,850
if that feels like.

1686
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,230
And that's like,
hold on,

1687
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,350
let's get to the course.
I figure most people are lazy.

1688
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:25,550
Okay.
Much.

1689
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:25,900
Right?
Yeah,

1690
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,240
there you go,
brother.

1691
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:29,433
Get success and then you know what?
When you get to a certain age and you 

1692
01:17:30,681 --> 01:17:33,890
realize you have accomplished nothing or
drove and all of a sudden you became.

1693
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:36,500
I mean say,
but most people are lazy.

1694
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:37,334
It's true.
I'd rather be in bed sleeping sometimes 

1695
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:43,430
when I get up and I do stop because I 
realized I have to be different,

1696
01:17:43,431 --> 01:17:44,264
but here's the thing.
You asked telling me what I have to 

1697
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,513
extra eyes compassionate.
Understanding how people are lazy 

1698
01:17:47,691 --> 01:17:49,850
because they woke up one day and they're
27,

1699
01:17:49,851 --> 01:17:50,960
they realize you have accomplished 
nothing,

1700
01:17:50,961 --> 01:17:53,120
so they turned to videos that tell them 
that it's not their fault,

1701
01:17:53,121 --> 01:17:54,340
it's somebody else's.
It's the white man.

1702
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:55,730
It's the rich man.
It's the tall man.

1703
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:57,110
It's the short man,
right?

1704
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:58,063
I don't care about any of that.
I am telling you that personal 

1705
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,030
responsibility is really the key to 
unlocking light.

1706
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,113
CanNot deny things that happened and did
you exercise compassion in those 

1707
01:18:07,551 --> 01:18:09,470
moments?
That's why I give to charity,

1708
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:10,423
right?
It's not going to be enough because by 

1709
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,830
taking the lazy people in my home,
I've already got a cat.

1710
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,760
She's pretty fucking lazy because what 
I'm saying is this.

1711
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:28,250
What am I saying?
What are you saying to me?

1712
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:32,720
So I'm saying to you that you are 
misusing your power,

1713
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:36,710
that you should be using your power to 
bring other people up.

1714
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:39,990
That's what I'm doing.
And I feel that to deny that there,

1715
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,073
that there is economic disparity.
The racial inequality is part of the 

1716
01:18:45,831 --> 01:18:46,664
story,
but historically there has been a 

1717
01:18:48,741 --> 01:18:51,830
component of the male oppression of a 
female.

1718
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:52,640
I don't.

1719
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,460
I agree with that.
I agree that the world puts.

1720
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:58,640
You're talking about our stories 
individually agree with.

1721
01:18:58,641 --> 01:19:00,500
We're agreeing everything that you just.
I don't deny.

1722
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,573
I acknowledged that there's economic 
disparity because I tell them everyday 

1723
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:06,500
the reasons why is why I teach them.
There's economic disparity.

1724
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,870
Don't be so foolish to believe it's 
because your skin is black.

1725
01:19:08,871 --> 01:19:11,270
It's because we are disproportionately 
taking handouts from the government.

1726
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:13,250
We are disproportionately marriage the 
government,

1727
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,680
and we have bought into our own victim 
mentality.

1728
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:17,870
Okay,
because we're taking advice from fucking

1729
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:18,704
Lebron James about politics and voting 
in people that want to do harm to the 

1730
01:19:22,011 --> 01:19:23,090
black community.
Plan.

1731
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:23,924
Simple.
Most people don't even know their own 

1732
01:19:24,891 --> 01:19:25,724
history.
You sit down and and you have black 

1733
01:19:26,871 --> 01:19:27,704
people that are advocating for planned 
parenthood and nobody's talking about 

1734
01:19:29,751 --> 01:19:30,584
the quiet black genocide that's taking 
place in America right now because our 

1735
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,990
birth rate has completely stagnated and 
we're the only ones.

1736
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:37,970
Sixty one percent of all new brush 
Latino.

1737
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,140
So in the Democrats say open borders,
open borders.

1738
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:41,630
What they're really saying is boats,
boats,

1739
01:19:41,631 --> 01:19:42,464
because the black people are not gonna.
Be able to stay in our party much 

1740
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:45,470
longer,
so let them know that planned parenthood

1741
01:19:45,471 --> 01:19:46,304
was created by an avowed racist,
Margaret Sanger who said that her 

1742
01:19:48,801 --> 01:19:51,020
purpose was to exterminate the black 
race.

1743
01:19:51,021 --> 01:19:52,670
She said,
black people should be exterminated like

1744
01:19:52,671 --> 01:19:54,410
weeds.
Most bucket don't know that,

1745
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,273
and yet they go out and they say 
conservatives are crazy because they 

1746
01:19:57,201 --> 01:19:59,990
want to defund planned parenthood 
defunded because the black,

1747
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:03,340
the black birth rate has has stagnated.
Okay,

1748
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:05,300
so I'm actually all about black and 
power,

1749
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:08,040
which is why when people actually find 
me long former listened to

1750
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,230
what I say,
it clicks and they say,

1751
01:20:10,231 --> 01:20:12,390
oh my God,
and then they researched Margaret sanger

1752
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,700
and then they researched that,
the black birth rate,

1753
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:15,623
and they realize that we have literally 
we are paying politicians taking the to 

1754
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:19,584
tear apart our families and it makes 
sure that we don't have a place in 

1755
01:20:22,261 --> 01:20:23,670
America.
I look,

1756
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:26,520
I agree with some of the things that you
are saying,

1757
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:27,383
but what I don't understand is how this 
information can neatly absolves or 

1758
01:20:33,181 --> 01:20:35,700
resolve itself at the point of a much 
wider.

1759
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,910
Donald trump's a good thing that's 
crazy.

1760
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:40,470
So easily illusion,
so easy.

1761
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,333
It's so easy.
That's how I got into this because 

1762
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:45,570
because Donald Trump was a thing,
Donald Trump has done more for the black

1763
01:20:45,571 --> 01:20:46,404
community then.
Then certainly any of the predecessor 

1764
01:20:48,121 --> 01:20:50,280
Democrat presidents had done beforehand.
You know,

1765
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,040
you have Bill Clinton who was held as a 
black presidential hero,

1766
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:55,350
but first black president is what they 
called Bill Clinton.

1767
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,333
He also locked up more black men than 
any president in the history of the 

1768
01:20:59,010 --> 01:20:59,843
United States.
That's a fact.

1769
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:01,410
He put in place with three strikes,
laws.

1770
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,680
That's a fact.
Um,

1771
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:05,420
and then you have lbj hailed as a hero 
in our textbooks.

1772
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:06,263
He's the one that implemented the 
welfare state and he called her the 

1773
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:08,670
nigger bill.
You know,

1774
01:21:08,671 --> 01:21:10,050
he,
he literally called,

1775
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:11,310
uh,
the civil rights act,

1776
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,173
the nigger belt bucket,
but don't know that now it's all 

1777
01:21:13,651 --> 01:21:14,510
available on the Internet.
So they're,

1778
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,353
all they have to do is hear what I say.
And they'll do that after they watch 

1779
01:21:17,041 --> 01:21:18,480
this podcast and do research and they 
go,

1780
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:21,030
why is it,
why is the education system lying to me?

1781
01:21:21,031 --> 01:21:22,770
Why do I think Bill Clinton's a good 
person?

1782
01:21:22,771 --> 01:21:25,950
After what he did to Haiti,
and I don't disagree with you,

1783
01:21:25,951 --> 01:21:26,784
I mean like I think more broadly,
I can see how you meet a lot of your 

1784
01:21:29,641 --> 01:21:34,590
goals by condemning apparently left 
centrist politicians who I remember I've

1785
01:21:34,591 --> 01:21:35,424
already told you I don't see the 
distinction between left and right 

1786
01:21:37,381 --> 01:21:40,040
within the limited framework of 
conventional political.

1787
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,710
That's fair as a,
uh,

1788
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,710
as,
as meaningful.

1789
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,750
Yeah.
Go and have some stuff to eat.

1790
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:49,150
The perhaps perhaps perhaps the problem 
is actually that you're hungry.

1791
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:50,803
Was Secretary happened because a hungry 
person who's taking it out on most 

1792
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:56,903
vulnerable members of society and the 
black community and the black community 

1793
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:08,903
for synchronous.
Now you sound like every leftist 

1794
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:14,910
politician script.
I'm empowering for black people.

1795
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,890
All they have to do is listen.
The

1796
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:21,510
goal of your empowerment,
it ends in a sort of a rather unpleasant

1797
01:22:21,511 --> 01:22:22,344
individualistic message that leaves 
behind that doesn't include the 

1798
01:22:26,161 --> 01:22:26,994
possibility that some people's social 
history and personal history has left 

1799
01:22:30,151 --> 01:22:34,740
them impaired and unable to compete in a
system but prizes,

1800
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:35,603
certain assets,
certain personal attributes above 

1801
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:39,210
others.
None of us like that.

1802
01:22:39,211 --> 01:22:40,044
We need a culture that can accommodate 
all people because all people exist and 

1803
01:22:43,741 --> 01:22:46,140
all people do have rights and if you 
like,

1804
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:49,710
whilst I feel like you know,
I can see the logic in,

1805
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,500
you know,
or what you're saying about I'm like,

1806
01:22:51,501 --> 01:22:53,280
you know,
the patriarchy stuff and all that.

1807
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,353
All you need to do is all we need to do 
is quickly look at who has the most 

1808
01:22:57,091 --> 01:22:58,860
wealth,
who has the most power,

1809
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:01,320
who has the most influence that day 
areas available.

1810
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:02,453
Like something like that.
You know when you say if like s like 15 

1811
01:23:05,531 --> 01:23:06,070
people have

1812
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,620
as much wealth as the poorest 5 billion 
people.

1813
01:23:08,621 --> 01:23:12,040
That's not minor.
That's a serious systemic problem.

1814
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:17,160
We could solve a great many problems by 
simply removing and redistribute in that

1815
01:23:18,401 --> 01:23:19,990
wealth,
but even that's not enough.

1816
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:20,893
I'm undergrad changing systems more 
broadly where we do agree hugely as on 

1817
01:23:24,761 --> 01:23:27,850
decentralization and the breakup of 
monopolies.

1818
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:28,743
But what I think is the biggest 
distinction you and I have is your 

1819
01:23:31,571 --> 01:23:34,510
belief that people are governed by 
selfish,

1820
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,153
selfish impulses and my belief that 
people are ultimately good and that we 

1821
01:23:39,941 --> 01:23:40,774
should create systems and communities 
and values that encourage our virtue 

1822
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:50,700
rather than usher us subtly towards 
either nihilism or selfishness,

1823
01:23:51,551 --> 01:23:55,580
and I think that that's what you are 
doing better than that.

1824
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:59,380
I'm preventing people from falling into 
your logic because the easiest people to

1825
01:23:59,381 --> 01:24:01,210
take advantage of people that believe 
what you believe,

1826
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:04,150
because then all they do is to take 
somebody like George Soros or Jeff Bezos

1827
01:24:04,151 --> 01:24:04,984
to say,
this is why they want socialism because 

1828
01:24:06,431 --> 01:24:08,110
it says all of you guys,
you're going to stay poor,

1829
01:24:08,111 --> 01:24:10,000
but we're going to sell to you that 
we're going to fix all your problems.

1830
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,170
You're going to get all of your rights 
to us,

1831
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:13,030
and that's what happens.
That's what happens every single time.

1832
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:13,893
Realized that within a system that has 
limited resources available to become 

1833
01:24:19,451 --> 01:24:22,060
rich anyway,
you think there's finite resources.

1834
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:24,040
What?
On a finite planet?

1835
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:24,571
Yes.
No,

1836
01:24:24,571 --> 01:24:26,170
no,
but like at once starting,

1837
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,900
people are and nobody else can get rich 
because that's wrong.

1838
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:33,880
Hold on a second then.
Why do you not believe you don't believe

1839
01:24:33,881 --> 01:24:34,714
that there's a stagnation in stacy's in 
where wealth is accumulated and where 

1840
01:24:37,301 --> 01:24:39,240
wealth is held.
Do you not see that there are a dentist?

1841
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:42,370
If you're buying into the myth that 
because somebody got rich,

1842
01:24:42,371 --> 01:24:45,920
somebody else got poor and that's wrong 
because somebody got rich multiples,

1843
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:49,203
perhaps our job because somebody got,
which does not mean that a bunch of 

1844
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:57,080
other people got poor.
That is a fallacy and it is.

1845
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:59,170
No,
that's just pulled back when Jack Dorsey

1846
01:24:59,171 --> 01:25:00,004
of twitter got rich,
all of his employees got poor and note 

1847
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:04,840
they became employees of twitter,
facebook employees.

1848
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,410
I'm a ton of people all around the world
because they're facebook now.

1849
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:09,700
Are they always register?
Mark Zuckerberg?

1850
01:25:09,701 --> 01:25:11,200
No,
but they were given opportunities to get

1851
01:25:11,201 --> 01:25:14,190
their foot in the door at a tech company
and it put facebook on their resume pro.

1852
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,450
The old capitalism.
I notice candice is.

1853
01:25:16,451 --> 01:25:17,710
I listened to you.
Big Secret.

1854
01:25:17,711 --> 01:25:18,610
I'm Amazon,
right?

1855
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:19,990
So listen,
here's the,

1856
01:25:19,991 --> 01:25:20,711
uh,
there's,

1857
01:25:20,711 --> 01:25:23,530
the world is limited.
It's only that big.

1858
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:24,543
There are people on the world,
only a tiny number of people have got 

1859
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:30,820
most of the wealth and asset.
Oh,

1860
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:33,190
if some of it will trickle down to the 
others,

1861
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:36,310
that's that the,
the idea that I did not work out,

1862
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:40,480
your people are keeping that wealth and 
not letting it trickle down,

1863
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:43,690
sticking people in prison because there 
are these brilliantly economic.

1864
01:25:43,691 --> 01:25:46,210
How do you extract well from wealthy 
people?

1865
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:47,930
Take it.
See that?

1866
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:48,910
That's your problem.

1867
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:51,790
That's theft.
No competition,

1868
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:52,624
free markets,
building a product that's better than 

1869
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:57,280
facebook to this,
that would lead to.

1870
01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:58,123
So what led to this mobilism in which 
something that I am staunchly against 

1871
01:26:01,961 --> 01:26:03,950
and I speak out about all the time,
don't agree with globalism.

1872
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,590
Globalism is a bunch of elitist.
Fighting themselves and saying,

1873
01:26:06,591 --> 01:26:07,424
wait a second.
How much power we control now that can 

1874
01:26:08,751 --> 01:26:12,330
make sure that we're the only ones that 
maintain more regulation.

1875
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:13,370
That's more government.
No,

1876
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:14,204
it's not.
It's the function of government to make 

1877
01:26:15,201 --> 01:26:17,600
sure that that doesn't happen.
Limited government.

1878
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:21,140
That is literally why we started putting
in place these policies in America.

1879
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,230
If the government hasn't happened,
listened to finish,

1880
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:24,093
being able to run without a government,
both literally eating food now all over 

1881
01:26:27,561 --> 01:26:30,230
the microphone.
If the government,

1882
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,133
so that we currently have on able to 
curb or in any way control corporate 

1883
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:36,224
power,
how is less government going to do that 

1884
01:26:38,331 --> 01:26:40,940
more effectively or less government 
busters to fight you.

1885
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:41,773
And when I'm saying limited government,
so the idea that growing welfare 

1886
01:26:45,261 --> 01:26:46,960
programs and trying to extract wealth 
from the rich,

1887
01:26:46,961 --> 01:26:48,350
it's just,
it's not gonna work that's not,

1888
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,333
that doesn't work over time because that
if you want to talk about a finite 

1889
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:53,330
resource,
there's only so much money you can bleed

1890
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:55,720
out of rich people.
Um,

1891
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:56,873
and,
and that's,

1892
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,220
and it never happens that way by the 
way.

1893
01:26:58,221 --> 01:26:59,900
They take money from the rich and they 
enrich themselves.

1894
01:26:59,901 --> 01:27:00,734
The government gets bigger,
the government gets Richard and people 

1895
01:27:01,881 --> 01:27:02,714
get poor.
That is what the history of the world 

1896
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,250
taught us.
Some things to be annoying,

1897
01:27:05,251 --> 01:27:06,140
you know,
because it's true,

1898
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:08,010
you know,
you know,

1899
01:27:08,011 --> 01:27:09,580
Cuba,
you know all,

1900
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,000
you know what happened in the Soviet 
Union,

1901
01:27:11,001 --> 01:27:13,220
you know what happened in Cuba,
you know what's happening in Venezuela,

1902
01:27:13,221 --> 01:27:15,040
you know that social and doesn't work 
and get your,

1903
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:18,200
your teaching or having your stroke,
but you are,

1904
01:27:18,201 --> 01:27:19,580
you're just not calling it socialism.

1905
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:23,230
That's what you're talking about.
We can't give.

1906
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,193
What is the new system.
You're either going to grow government 

1907
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:27,140
or you're going to grow the individual.
No,

1908
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:29,030
there's no.
That's not the only option.

1909
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:29,571
Oh,
Gimme.

1910
01:27:29,571 --> 01:27:30,890
GimMe Gimme.
Another option.

1911
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:37,850
I think de-centralized collectivized 
communities,

1912
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:42,020
a confederacy of principled,
cooperating,

1913
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,153
fully autonomous self governing 
communities that might require to some 

1914
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:47,804
degree,
some ability to tax regulate and 

1915
01:27:52,791 --> 01:27:53,624
control.
Certainly the kind of transnational 

1916
01:27:58,630 --> 01:28:02,870
monoliths that we tax to the government.
I don't know,

1917
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:04,420
but what's the problem?
But.

1918
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:09,640
But hold on a second,
you can't like get all like me because I

1919
01:28:09,641 --> 01:28:10,474
have.
I'm not able to immediately designed a 

1920
01:28:12,271 --> 01:28:14,120
new system.
It's not immediately.

1921
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:16,200
You've been doing this for awhile and 
when I listen to,

1922
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:19,220
it's not the first time you've had this 
conversation.

1923
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,530
You're either you,
you want to play it both ways,

1924
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:22,880
so you want to say I believe in the 
community,

1925
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:23,810
but the community should tax.

1926
01:28:23,810 --> 01:28:24,643
Okay,
so the community should be a government 

1927
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:26,373
website and let's try and see if we can 
work out together because if it's not 

1928
01:28:29,031 --> 01:28:29,864
good,
we just simply won't you because he's a 

1929
01:28:30,351 --> 01:28:32,150
bit of the podcast.
We're going to use all of it.

1930
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:34,190
People need to know we are building a 
government thing,

1931
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:34,881
right?
Just say it,

1932
01:28:34,881 --> 01:28:36,470
right?
Say we like take for example,

1933
01:28:36,471 --> 01:28:37,304
now we've had brexit.
Britain could be an independent unit if 

1934
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:41,143
I agree that we decentralized government
power because it is meaningless and it 

1935
01:28:44,091 --> 01:28:46,940
doesn't serve ordinary people.
However,

1936
01:28:46,941 --> 01:28:49,040
what we need people do.
Some people,

1937
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:49,874
a lot of people it seems to want jobs 
and they want to be meaningfully paid 

1938
01:28:53,771 --> 01:28:54,604
for those jobs.
Some people that I think are not paid 

1939
01:28:55,521 --> 01:28:56,960
enough money,
police,

1940
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:58,820
nurses,
teachers,

1941
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,800
none of these people are paid enough for
what they do.

1942
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:02,370
That's because of the unions.
That's because the government.

1943
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:03,263
Oh yeah,
the LG unions and the government allow 

1944
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:08,670
us to fire fire,
bad teachers bringing negative things in

1945
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:10,100
there.
You're white bringing negative energy.

1946
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:13,440
It's true.
The government is is the reason for that

1947
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:16,320
now differently in this new utopia that 
we're trying to create.

1948
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:17,880
It wouldn't.
Your gender,

1949
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:21,360
religion,
and race would be irrelevant to you?

1950
01:29:21,361 --> 01:29:23,550
You'd be free to practice whatever.
It's foolish.

1951
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,680
I already don't have this government.
That's insane.

1952
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:26,613
Hold on.
Maybe the government is not done 

1953
01:29:27,091 --> 01:29:29,490
anything yet.
This is ridiculous.

1954
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:31,110
What's ridiculous?
Let me ask you a question.

1955
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:36,060
Actually a very good question.
Most of you offset those talks to you.

1956
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:36,870
No.
Okay.

1957
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:40,130
Listen,
Paul wrote the myth of Co a.

1958
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,440
that's a loaded question.
Do you believe in multiculturalism?

1959
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:47,620
Do I believe that there are many 
cultures that they can just exist,

1960
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:48,533
coexist peacefully?
I think that there are many cultures 

1961
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:52,500
think that they can exist.

1962
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:56,340
I think we're two people in a room and 
it's a problem,

1963
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,233
so of course there's going to be 
conflict if people have got different 

1964
01:29:59,101 --> 01:30:00,240
belief systems.
However,

1965
01:30:00,241 --> 01:30:01,260
we cost like,
Yo,

1966
01:30:01,261 --> 01:30:02,220
right,
hold on a minute,

1967
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,680
so you want total deregulation of bloody
capitalists,

1968
01:30:04,681 --> 01:30:07,470
but when it comes to what people want 
book people read when they're praying,

1969
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:08,363
oh,
suddenly,

1970
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:14,010
suddenly there is a regulation.
You can be whatever religion you want to

1971
01:30:14,011 --> 01:30:15,960
be an American.
There's no regulation on that,

1972
01:30:15,961 --> 01:30:18,700
but what I'm saying she was,
do you believe that that mold,

1973
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:21,860
multiple cultures can coexist peacefully
because that's it.

1974
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:23,280
That's a.
that's a huge problem.

1975
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:24,223
What do you believe in then secretary?
I believe that the biggest problem 

1976
01:30:26,161 --> 01:30:26,994
facing Europe right now is the is the 
mass migration from countries that do 

1977
01:30:29,821 --> 01:30:32,160
not support the culture of Europe.
Right?

1978
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:32,790
Look,
shut up.

1979
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:34,170
Let's talk about some.
All right.

1980
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:35,710
Good.
To talk about some positive thing.

1981
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:39,660
Trying to create a utopia or over here 
in this thing,

1982
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:40,553
in this new,
this new Britain that we're trying to 

1983
01:30:41,971 --> 01:30:44,760
create on my ipad.
It doesn't matter what your gender is or

1984
01:30:44,761 --> 01:30:47,040
how you identify.
It doesn't matter what color you are and

1985
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,930
it doesn't matter what your religion is.
You can't buy.

1986
01:30:48,931 --> 01:30:51,750
You cannot impose your will on other 
people.

1987
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:52,613
You can't go around saying you,
but you should believe this or you 

1988
01:30:54,061 --> 01:30:56,400
shouldn't believe that.
You've got to leave people a hell alone.

1989
01:30:56,430 --> 01:30:57,660
Right?
It doesn't work.

1990
01:30:58,490 --> 01:30:59,323
It doesn't yell.
Component of Sharia law is that people 

1991
01:31:01,111 --> 01:31:03,840
that are non believers get killed.
Hold on a second.

1992
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:06,720
I didn't say we will help you.
We want Sharia law.

1993
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:09,000
I'm not bringing in Sharia law.
That's not.

1994
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:11,380
We're not having met on the island.
It sounds terrifying,

1995
01:31:11,410 --> 01:31:12,870
right?
Bomb this sharia.

1996
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:16,290
Now what we're gonna do on the island 
now,

1997
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:18,670
he said,
people can be fully there,

1998
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:20,130
fully autonomous.
They can do what they want.

1999
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:20,993
Now.
I suppose we are going to have to have 

2000
01:31:22,381 --> 01:31:23,214
communities now.
I think it might be hard for human 

2001
01:31:24,661 --> 01:31:27,270
beings to live in communities that are 
too big.

2002
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,193
I think many of the problems that we're 
experiencing now is it's hard for us to 

2003
01:31:30,781 --> 01:31:31,614
hold the number of relationships we see.
Too much variety of life is confusing 

2004
01:31:35,071 --> 01:31:35,904
for people.
I think we need to live in smaller 

2005
01:31:37,231 --> 01:31:39,030
communities and within these 
communities,

2006
01:31:39,031 --> 01:31:39,930
these units,
these,

2007
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:45,260
let's call them Soviet people.
People have full a full democracy within

2008
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:48,234
it.
People vote on how they want their 

2009
01:31:49,351 --> 01:31:50,960
resources as happened.
Importantly,

2010
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:51,803
agree Brazil,
you vote on like say each community is 

2011
01:31:54,451 --> 01:31:55,284
allocated a budget and the members of 
that community vote for how to spend 

2012
01:31:58,411 --> 01:31:59,244
that budget.

2013
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,640
Okay.
Right.

2014
01:32:00,641 --> 01:32:01,474
That's good.
So far we do need some municipal 

2015
01:32:03,521 --> 01:32:04,630
resources,
IEA,

2016
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:07,060
roads,
Agri police officers,

2017
01:32:07,061 --> 01:32:09,160
fire malaise,
fireman and nurses.

2018
01:32:09,161 --> 01:32:09,994
All of those.
So that revenue has got to come from 

2019
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:15,160
somewhere.
Private business world isn't gas attacks

2020
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:17,710
I'm comfortable with because it's for 
municipalities and that's the difference

2021
01:32:17,711 --> 01:32:20,010
between not theft and something that I 
get to use.

2022
01:32:20,011 --> 01:32:22,510
So I need it now.
Do wheat right now.

2023
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,340
Are we gonna?
Need some kind of.

2024
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:25,750
Because people are going to be jealous 
of this.

2025
01:32:25,751 --> 01:32:27,190
They're going to want to come and live 
here with us.

2026
01:32:27,191 --> 01:32:31,450
We're going to identify how are we going
to control the population we have here,

2027
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:33,250
right?
We're going to need to know,

2028
01:32:33,251 --> 01:32:33,681
right?
Okay.

2029
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:36,580
We good?
We can just like we're not building,

2030
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:40,420
we're an island.
We're surrounded by a moat already.

2031
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:42,903
Look,
what I'm saying is that there are so 

2032
01:32:44,951 --> 01:32:45,784
many unexplored possibilities and um,
people on both the left and right and 

2033
01:32:49,721 --> 01:32:54,100
I've got those I spoke to,
enough of them now impede further debate

2034
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:54,993
and progressing by insisting that their 
preexisting ideology is the only thing 

2035
01:32:59,411 --> 01:33:00,244
that could possibly work as if history 
were rich enough and long enough that 

2036
01:33:03,101 --> 01:33:06,910
blinking of an eye,
the expanding of one flower,

2037
01:33:06,911 --> 01:33:10,210
the issue manatee were enough to examine
all possibilities.

2038
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:11,253
Now me,
all that stuff you say is wooly wishy 

2039
01:33:13,271 --> 01:33:16,720
washy left the crowd.
Clap trap is mere pragmatism.

2040
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:17,733
The experience of being human is painful
enough without us being cruel to one 

2041
01:33:21,551 --> 01:33:22,384
another.
We need to live in communities where 

2042
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:25,503
people are infested and administrative 
and certainly our democratic level in 

2043
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:33,280
the way that their resources are spent 
and the way their communities are run,

2044
01:33:33,281 --> 01:33:34,114
the way their schools around the way 
their hospitals around full 

2045
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:39,970
democratization.
So that's what I'm arguing for.

2046
01:33:39,971 --> 01:33:42,250
So everything that you just drew is 
America.

2047
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:43,593
The founding,
the founding principles of America is 

2048
01:33:49,421 --> 01:33:51,230
what you just do.
And that's what conservatives fight for.

2049
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,260
I'm going to against it that you are 
conservative.

2050
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:55,060
You just haven't acknowledged it yet.
I'm not concerned.

2051
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:56,163
You don't realize it.
I'm just going to say that you're an 

2052
01:33:57,431 --> 01:33:58,264
anarchist and you don't acknowledge it,
but because you want to break down all 

2053
01:34:00,461 --> 01:34:01,294
power structures and you think that 
people want the government where you 

2054
01:34:04,331 --> 01:34:06,670
just wrote municipalities,
that's the function of government.

2055
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:09,040
The government should make sure that 
those programs run efficiently,

2056
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:10,053
that that,
that we have access to other people are 

2057
01:34:11,621 --> 01:34:13,300
paving roads and that sort of a thing.
The,

2058
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:15,790
the infrastructure,
all of that is an important thing.

2059
01:34:15,791 --> 01:34:17,950
I think might bust up your conservative 
thing,

2060
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:21,460
but,
but our priorities are not commerce.

2061
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,323
Our priorities are creating a nourishing
the communities that we live in 

2062
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:30,690
supporting and loving one another,
so according to each,

2063
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:34,890
according to their needs,
that commerce that is common,

2064
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:38,403
this call it community ism is community 
is we make the community the most 

2065
01:34:42,251 --> 01:34:43,084
important thing and the w.
What the community has to do is empower 

2066
01:34:45,461 --> 01:34:46,294
the individual and love the individual 
and acknowledged that we in our history 

2067
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:54,070
of colonization and war,
we have hurt and damaged one another and

2068
01:34:54,071 --> 01:34:54,904
people are carrying trauma and pain from
like your anorexia and racial abuse is 

2069
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:01,394
another lesson for me are prime examples
of exactly that and it to you for the 

2070
01:35:06,051 --> 01:35:10,520
way that you have alchemize that into 
individual potency,

2071
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:13,100
but I don't think we should be getting 
off the train too early.

2072
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:17,780
Why set the bar so low for humankind?
Not only are we not victims,

2073
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:18,643
we can be glorious.
We are not determined by our lower 

2074
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:23,630
instincts and the lower aspects of our 
nature.

2075
01:35:23,631 --> 01:35:26,120
We can continue to grow.
Continue to aspire.

2076
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:27,860
The thing is is that when I asked you to
draw it out,

2077
01:35:27,861 --> 01:35:28,694
your drawing systems that already exist,
but to create anything new and so we 

2078
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:33,453
can't look good,
but we can look back into the history 

2079
01:35:35,301 --> 01:35:37,040
and see how it worked out.
Communism.

2080
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:39,400
Now hold on.
I'm not drawing things that.

2081
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:42,140
Hold a sec.
Mao was hardly.

2082
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:46,630
Decentralist was so serious.
Centralized power and bureaucracy.

2083
01:35:46,631 --> 01:35:47,464
No,
but he raised that uprising that you're 

2084
01:35:48,621 --> 01:35:50,990
talking about the proletariat versus the
rich people,

2085
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:52,540
but you need an asset,
your you,

2086
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:56,750
your wire riding on the wave of 
contemporary populism and populism.

2087
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:59,510
As Steve Bannon says,
could go either way.

2088
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,010
It could go either way.

2089
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:02,480
Eva,
ordinary people go,

2090
01:36:02,481 --> 01:36:03,314
yeah,
it's really going to help me to 

2091
01:36:04,221 --> 01:36:05,054
deregulate the already powerful people 
that are trotting around the globe like 

2092
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:12,740
ogres or we could through this wave of 
populism,

2093
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:16,670
empower community,
empower ordinary people,

2094
01:36:16,671 --> 01:36:17,504
and we are all ordinary people 
ultimately in spite of our various 

2095
01:36:20,391 --> 01:36:23,420
individual skills and they don't like 
the word capitalism.

2096
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:29,200
I don't like the the goals.
Your individual should be the goal.

2097
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:30,284
I just send a message and be rewarded 
this much and you decided that the 

2098
01:36:34,251 --> 01:36:35,084
balance in your life is that you want to
instead go and gifts the community more 

2099
01:36:37,611 --> 01:36:40,250
that should be allowed,
but why should you be able to govern how

2100
01:36:40,251 --> 01:36:42,890
much I give to the community versus how 
much I get to myself.

2101
01:36:42,891 --> 01:36:44,960
That's wrong.
That makes you a dictator.

2102
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:45,883
You decided that you know so well about 
society that you're going to sell 

2103
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:48,843
everybody.

2104
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,920
I didn't say that,
but I'm saying the big year,

2105
01:36:51,950 --> 01:36:54,770
like the concepts that you're preaching 
here because you don't like to name what

2106
01:36:54,771 --> 01:36:55,730
you're saying,
right?

2107
01:36:55,731 --> 01:36:56,880
You don't like it when I say social.
No,

2108
01:36:56,881 --> 01:36:57,621
I didn't say that.
Yeah,

2109
01:36:57,621 --> 01:36:58,454
you drew you.
You're basically telling us and this 

2110
01:37:00,021 --> 01:37:03,120
entire podcast and the next minute you 
say,

2111
01:37:03,121 --> 01:37:04,580
I'm a consultant.
A bit of both.

2112
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,490
Conservative,
Communist,

2113
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:12,450
complicated.
These are times when the old divide,

2114
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:13,903
excuse me,
and the old polarities are starting to 

2115
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:16,454
dissolve.
While we feel like people are becoming 

2116
01:37:18,021 --> 01:37:22,400
more and more opposed to each other,
I think we're becoming closer and closer

2117
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,560
to rejecting the systems that oppress 
us,

2118
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:25,543
not just economically that's a.
These are the crumbs I'm talking about 

2119
01:37:27,921 --> 01:37:30,980
spiritually preventing people from 
realizing their potential.

2120
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:34,910
So I do believe in the power of 
previously oppressed people,

2121
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,370
but I think to like people,
you know,

2122
01:37:37,371 --> 01:37:38,204
as an individual,
I wouldn't like to continue to revel in 

2123
01:37:40,041 --> 01:37:41,990
my misery or this and that.
We will want to do.

2124
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:43,993
People do need to progress.
I'm like to deny like something as God 

2125
01:37:48,621 --> 01:37:49,454
historically scarring I slavery,
so why would I be scarred by that were 

2126
01:37:53,651 --> 01:37:54,484
over.
There is some evidence to suggest that 

2127
01:37:55,141 --> 01:37:56,190
there is a hereditary

2128
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:57,023
trauma.
I mean even psychological leftist 

2129
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:00,023
professor,
probably Cambridge because we'll the 

2130
01:38:03,691 --> 01:38:04,524
same way that we evolve features.
We evolve emotionally and something is 

2131
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:11,730
as recent as that.
That is so ridiculous.

2132
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:14,230
Everybody that has been.
Everybody feels like it's.

2133
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:17,550
Everyone has been a slave at some point.
There was slavery here too.

2134
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,740
Did you feel your slavery pain the other
week?

2135
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,680
I'm from Essex.
Should we hold hands?

2136
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:27,270
No.
Slavery that we both experienced.

2137
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:30,030
Oh my gosh.
Oh,

2138
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:30,983
that feels so good to acknowledge.
Finally something that we both feel 

2139
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:39,980
might be concerned.
Candice.

2140
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:42,540
Now listen,
Jenny,

2141
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:43,523
my.
You've got his picture before pose her 

2142
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:46,373
elegant.

2143
01:38:50,450 --> 01:38:51,830
It's so sad.
No,

2144
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:52,830
this.
This feels good,

2145
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:53,783
but why?
Why would you think that people should 

2146
01:38:57,631 --> 01:39:01,050
revel in mystery,
but we have to acknowledge pain.

2147
01:39:01,051 --> 01:39:03,930
You have to acknowledge that history has
happened.

2148
01:39:04,110 --> 01:39:07,020
What do you think about reparations?
The pain doesn't exist anymore.

2149
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:11,880
What do we think about against it?
There would be no United Kingdom.

2150
01:39:11,881 --> 01:39:15,480
There will be no United States slippery 
slope I've ever heard in my entire life.

2151
01:39:15,481 --> 01:39:16,800
Why?
What'd you think it would slip and slide

2152
01:39:16,801 --> 01:39:18,390
off quality?
No,

2153
01:39:18,391 --> 01:39:19,224
it wouldn't.
It wouldn't.

2154
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,430
It would go into.
Okay,

2155
01:39:20,431 --> 01:39:23,370
but before,
before we were slaves in Africa,

2156
01:39:23,371 --> 01:39:24,600
we have.
Everybody has.

2157
01:39:24,610 --> 01:39:25,443
How has it in their past.
So how far back do you want to do 

2158
01:39:26,981 --> 01:39:28,710
operations?
Roman empire.

2159
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:31,360
Do you want to go back to that?
Do the Italian.

2160
01:39:31,361 --> 01:39:32,550
So everybody.
Reparations.

2161
01:39:32,551 --> 01:39:33,384
You get what I'm saying?
It's the slope is so slippery that you 

2162
01:39:34,711 --> 01:39:37,320
can't make a point in society.

2163
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:38,940
And by the way,
the best reparations,

2164
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:40,343
the most successful people in the world 
ring lines a system is a line you're 

2165
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:45,030
currently saying,
well,

2166
01:39:45,031 --> 01:39:47,250
let's not do any reparation.
No,

2167
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,890
I don't believe there's no share any 
wealth.

2168
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:52,320
That's where the lines are currently 
drawn.

2169
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:55,560
So for me,
people that talk about reparations,

2170
01:39:55,561 --> 01:39:58,290
they've raised an important point by 
exposing the fact that they use,

2171
01:39:58,950 --> 01:39:59,783
excuse me,
great countries about the United 

2172
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:01,890
Kingdom,
United States of America,

2173
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:05,640
entirely founded on stolen his books.
You talk about taxation of the rich have

2174
01:40:05,641 --> 01:40:07,590
been stealing them.
What the fuck was slavery?

2175
01:40:07,591 --> 01:40:11,520
What the fuck was colonialism other than
stealing on a massive scale?

2176
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:12,413
You can't have one without the other.
What I'm saying is that slavery still 

2177
01:40:15,571 --> 01:40:18,390
exists in Africa today.
So for people to pretend that we were,

2178
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:21,390
it was stolen from him like we were 
kings and Queens and Africa's a myth.

2179
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:22,253
No,
we were slaves were sold by our own 

2180
01:40:23,131 --> 01:40:23,730
people.

2181
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:26,760
So who are we met at the Africans we met
at the Americans.

2182
01:40:26,761 --> 01:40:29,100
It's a piece of furniture that happened.
It was very unfortunate.

2183
01:40:29,101 --> 01:40:30,410
Okay.
But it happened to be.

2184
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:33,080
It is unfortunate,
but it happens everywhere there.

2185
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:35,300
There's not that long ago.
No,

2186
01:40:35,390 --> 01:40:37,400
but since the beginning of time there 
had been slaves.

2187
01:40:37,401 --> 01:40:38,234
So how do you decide that one black 
slaves in America are the ones deserve 

2188
01:40:41,461 --> 01:40:42,320
reparations?
Every.

2189
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:44,940
The slope is.
And let me tell you something.

2190
01:40:46,330 --> 01:40:47,410
You.
No,

2191
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:48,430
no,
no.

2192
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,580
The challenge.
Black Americans.

2193
01:40:50,581 --> 01:40:53,890
Would you rather be in America today?
Do you wish it never happened?

2194
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,650
They single black America and I've met 
will tell you if they wish they lived in

2195
01:40:56,651 --> 01:40:57,820
Africa to say,
do you want to know why?

2196
01:40:57,970 --> 01:40:59,800
Because all the opportunities are in 
America.

2197
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:02,950
Black Americans today.
If we banded together would be the 30,

2198
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:03,843
30,
I think number six in terms of the 

2199
01:41:04,571 --> 01:41:06,640
economy in the world.
How'd you mean band together?

2200
01:41:06,670 --> 01:41:08,930
Like if we said we're going to carol and
little country black Americans,

2201
01:41:08,931 --> 01:41:10,120
so yeah,
we would be.

2202
01:41:10,121 --> 01:41:12,900
Would be ranked as like that happened 
it.

2203
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:13,813
Hey,
the way the visa people are talking to 

2204
01:41:15,261 --> 01:41:16,094
just my.
We have self segregation happening in 

2205
01:41:17,741 --> 01:41:18,574
America now,
which is about the dumbest thing I've 

2206
01:41:19,511 --> 01:41:22,480
ever heard in my entire life.
I want you to be more optimistic.

2207
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:25,010
I wouldn't you be more ambitious.
I feel like you were there.

2208
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:26,780
How old are you?
If I'm a 29.

2209
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:28,680
Oh my God.
Is that older?

2210
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:30,470
Young?
Yeah.

2211
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:32,110
Holder young.
Young.

2212
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:33,310
What happened?
What happened?

2213
01:41:33,311 --> 01:41:34,001
We have a.
hold on.

2214
01:41:34,001 --> 01:41:36,330
Let me do this sort of questions that 
are easy to make clips out of.

2215
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:37,130
I might have to.
Jennifer.

2216
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:39,850
Things we might have to lift up is.
I think I've called you love twice.

2217
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,460
Like six to go see.
There we go.

2218
01:41:42,461 --> 01:41:44,990
Now we're living.
It didn't mean to do it.

2219
01:41:44,991 --> 01:41:47,160
I'm in love as in an affection towards 
you.

2220
01:41:47,161 --> 01:41:47,994
So.
But that's what I'm.

2221
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,090
That's what I'm saying.
It's like,

2222
01:41:49,091 --> 01:41:52,210
why can't you say that?
Because some people find it offensive.

2223
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:54,340
I hate the society we live in.
It's a joke,

2224
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:55,520
right?
This is know.

2225
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:56,443
Um,
I mean the side of trying to create 

2226
01:41:57,971 --> 01:41:58,804
leftists only you only elect this would 
pull that out of a clip and say it's 

2227
01:42:01,061 --> 01:42:02,050
wrong.
Only left.

2228
01:42:02,051 --> 01:42:02,884
This gets mad when a,
a man opens the door and the real power 

2229
01:42:04,931 --> 01:42:05,360
though.

2230
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,210
No,
yeah,

2231
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,053
they do because they're dressing it up 
as feminism when in reality they're 

2232
01:42:09,551 --> 01:42:12,290
gaining power.
But power is control over resources.

2233
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:16,390
They just saying something to your soul 
rose thing.

2234
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:17,800
Of course there is.
When they,

2235
01:42:17,801 --> 01:42:19,280
when they freak out,
they try to,

2236
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:21,250
to stop.
Breck had enough from being nominated to

2237
01:42:21,251 --> 01:42:22,920
the supreme court.
That was radical feminism.

2238
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:25,150
He never sexually harass anybody.
Never happened.

2239
01:42:25,810 --> 01:42:26,643
I'm sure different kind of interview,
but have a field day with you because 

2240
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:30,430
the things you say like,
uh,

2241
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:34,740
like properly rape is a thing now.
So we have to acknowledge it right now.

2242
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:38,320
Now listen to A.
I'm going to stop you.

2243
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:42,590
You're scared.
I'm not scared that I will say for you,

2244
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:44,200
which is a wonderful quality and a 
human,

2245
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:47,740
where do you think true power lies 
within the individual,

2246
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:48,723
within yourself?

2247
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:51,580
Well,
that's not true.

2248
01:42:51,581 --> 01:42:56,260
Is it because of the individual on this 
planet is as powerful as Halliburton?

2249
01:42:56,730 --> 01:42:57,563
Well,
what do you.

2250
01:42:57,580 --> 01:43:01,230
What's your measure of power or ability 
to get what you want done,

2251
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:02,890
but what?
What do you want done?

2252
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:04,600
That varies from individual to 
individual.

2253
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:05,434
So the power rests with the individual.
There is a uniform concept of will and 

2254
01:43:08,861 --> 01:43:11,130
the people whose will is most easily 
exerted.

2255
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:12,790
There is a,
there is a hierarchy,

2256
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:13,743
so I would say and the most powerful 
people that people are generally born 

2257
01:43:16,451 --> 01:43:20,190
into positions where the power was 
already had already been accumulating.

2258
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:21,790
All.
Alright.

2259
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:23,583
But it's definitely true though,
and we're going to edit this so that 

2260
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:29,370
your response will be rough.
You've really changed my mind.

2261
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:33,070
What you said,
you really changed my mind.

2262
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:36,490
What you said was so insightful and so.
Yes.

2263
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:41,010
I'm so glad to be here.
That's the trailer candies.

2264
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,280
Well,
about this thing here.

2265
01:43:42,281 --> 01:43:43,114
Um,
do you think this is a good question 

2266
01:43:44,201 --> 01:43:45,610
jenny?
Jenny wrote this question,

2267
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:46,853
do you think the old Protestant myth 
that working hard and personal 

2268
01:43:49,631 --> 01:43:51,980
responsibility is deployed to prevent 
governments

2269
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,290
and authorities from actually helping?
Yeah,

2270
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:55,160
it is,
isn't it?

2271
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:55,581
Well,
yeah.

2272
01:43:55,581 --> 01:43:56,414
Well,
the idea is that we don't want 

2273
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:57,981
governments.
We,

2274
01:43:57,981 --> 01:43:58,814
we,
we believe in ourselves on a community 

2275
01:43:59,871 --> 01:44:01,180
level so that,
that's the,

2276
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:02,053
that's the goal is to realize that the 
job of a government wasn't supposed to 

2277
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:05,900
be to,
to um,

2278
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:07,610
government.
Every piece of our lives,

2279
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:09,350
you know,
the government in many ways is trying to

2280
01:44:09,351 --> 01:44:10,760
replace God,
you know,

2281
01:44:10,761 --> 01:44:13,340
at people you through like that idea,
and I agree with it.

2282
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:18,400
But statism and post Westphalian tree 
nationalism simply replace the notion of

2283
01:44:19,731 --> 01:44:22,790
a,
an omnipotent and that,

2284
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:24,710
that that's definitely true.
Well,

2285
01:44:24,711 --> 01:44:28,430
according to my little brain right now,
what about this thing here?

2286
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:29,913
I want to ask our county West Corp,
that's a very sort of important 

2287
01:44:32,661 --> 01:44:34,970
celebrity type of thing.
So,

2288
01:44:34,971 --> 01:44:36,140
uh,
what happened there?

2289
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:37,270
Uh,
which,

2290
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:39,410
which ports,
like he's banging into,

2291
01:44:39,411 --> 01:44:40,700
you know,
he says,

2292
01:44:40,701 --> 01:44:43,580
I've been used to mean by first and 
foremost.

2293
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:44,100
I don't,
I,

2294
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:46,490
I know Kanye didn't write those sweet.
It's not how he speaks,

2295
01:44:46,491 --> 01:44:47,324
but Kanye realized very soon,
and this is the cleanest I can say it 

2296
01:44:51,351 --> 01:44:55,280
because I did make a promise to him that
I wouldn't speak about this publicly,

2297
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:56,773
but Kanye realized,
I think very quickly that there no such 

2298
01:44:59,361 --> 01:45:00,194
thing as doing politics halfway.
You are either fully in and you risk 

2299
01:45:03,741 --> 01:45:05,300
everything around you,
your friends,

2300
01:45:05,301 --> 01:45:06,400
your family,
your,

2301
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:07,670
your,
wherever you are in life,

2302
01:45:07,671 --> 01:45:10,460
your business negotiations,
like in the way that trump did or you're

2303
01:45:10,461 --> 01:45:11,294
out of it.
And unfortunately in this I guess is 

2304
01:45:12,891 --> 01:45:13,650
public.
Uh,

2305
01:45:13,650 --> 01:45:14,483
you know,
Kim always says that she disagrees with 

2306
01:45:15,651 --> 01:45:16,484
Kanye.
I'm politically and so for him to cause 

2307
01:45:18,951 --> 01:45:21,860
a tremor in his life all around him,
he has children,

2308
01:45:21,861 --> 01:45:22,191
young,
you know,

2309
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:23,360
young children.
Um,

2310
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:25,670
that's a risky deal to make.
I mean,

2311
01:45:25,671 --> 01:45:27,110
he also has his big adidas deal.

2312
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:27,943
That's a risky thing to do,
to go into politics and upon and Maggie 

2313
01:45:29,721 --> 01:45:32,390
had to talk to trump and the left 
controls hollywood.

2314
01:45:32,391 --> 01:45:33,260
I mean,
that's just what it is,

2315
01:45:33,261 --> 01:45:34,094
you know,
that,

2316
01:45:34,270 --> 01:45:35,240
um,
they all think the same.

2317
01:45:35,241 --> 01:45:36,920
Every award show.
It's not even funny anymore.

2318
01:45:36,921 --> 01:45:37,754
It's just like,
just talk about trump for the next two 

2319
01:45:38,931 --> 01:45:39,411
hours.
I mean,

2320
01:45:39,411 --> 01:45:40,940
it's a joke.
They've ruined comedy.

2321
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,540
Um,
and I think that a cognac,

2322
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:44,593
it was receiving a lot of heat and he 
respectfully needed to step out of the 

2323
01:45:46,641 --> 01:45:47,474
kitchen.
I,

2324
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:50,030
you know,
I guess I was his entrance into positive

2325
01:45:50,060 --> 01:45:50,893
politics and I was just entrance out.
It was him tweeting me that caused the 

2326
01:45:53,601 --> 01:45:56,720
entire firestorm and it was him tweeting
me that was the same way out.

2327
01:45:56,721 --> 01:45:58,960
But I deeply respect him.
You mean the.

2328
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:02,510
So you feel like when people get 
involved in politics is,

2329
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:03,920
it's all consuming.

2330
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:04,813
Oh,
it's it.

2331
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:05,963
Every layer of your life they,
they try to find everything you've ever 

2332
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:08,444
done in your entire life.
They try to get people to speak out 

2333
01:46:10,101 --> 01:46:10,934
against you.
The amount of fights I've had with my 

2334
01:46:12,141 --> 01:46:15,350
family because reporters call and say 
things that I never said,

2335
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:17,270
Hey,
Kenneth tells me you're this or that.

2336
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:18,313
And then your parents obviously think 
that they're telling the truth and they 

2337
01:46:20,151 --> 01:46:23,920
get all flustered and they are super 
proud of you.

2338
01:46:23,921 --> 01:46:24,754
I,
Hey,

2339
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:29,070
grandpa loves Robert and Granddad 
applebee's.

2340
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:29,930
I,
yeah,

2341
01:46:29,930 --> 01:46:31,140
well I'm his child,
I'm just,

2342
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,960
he,
he's somebody that started his life on a

2343
01:46:32,961 --> 01:46:34,970
sharecropping farm and worked his butt 
off.

2344
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:35,813
Never said he couldn't do something 
because he was black or he was just 

2345
01:46:37,370 --> 01:46:40,100
advantage because he grew up in a 
segregated south.

2346
01:46:40,101 --> 01:46:41,620
He just worked hard,
kept his head down,

2347
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:42,473
do what he had to do and found success.
And I know I definitely got my 

2348
01:46:46,161 --> 01:46:48,980
motivation in life from his sort of 
steady counseling.

2349
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:50,550
He's like a no nonsense.

2350
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:52,800
Um,
he sounds like an incredible man.

2351
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:54,320
Yeah.
How do,

2352
01:46:54,350 --> 01:46:59,190
what do you feel like success is gonna 
look like for you ultimately?

2353
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:01,590
You know,
what would it feel like success for you?

2354
01:47:01,670 --> 01:47:03,180
How?
What would make you fulfilled?

2355
01:47:03,181 --> 01:47:05,280
Candice?
I think first and foremost,

2356
01:47:05,281 --> 01:47:07,810
cracking the black vote.
Showing that we're not a monolith,

2357
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:10,370
that we think differently and that we're
starting to listen to the policies.

2358
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:11,213
Not The emotional argument for any group
of individuals to be voting in 90 

2359
01:47:14,221 --> 01:47:16,960
percent margins for one party shows you 
that at,

2360
01:47:16,970 --> 01:47:20,130
especially when that party has never 
done anything that has served you,

2361
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:21,143
shows you that we've made an emotional 
investment into politics and ultimately 

2362
01:47:23,431 --> 01:47:25,770
harmed our personal lives.
Do not think is significantly.

2363
01:47:25,771 --> 01:47:26,604
There are only two parties in.
Neither of those parties meaningfully 

2364
01:47:29,311 --> 01:47:32,580
represent the interests of people who 
have been oppressed.

2365
01:47:32,581 --> 01:47:34,470
I think trump represents a whole new 
house,

2366
01:47:34,530 --> 01:47:36,190
but because he's independent,
they all hate them.

2367
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:37,043
Everybody hated trump.
Doesn't know my average except for the 

2368
01:47:38,641 --> 01:47:40,530
American people.
If you could ask these people,

2369
01:47:40,531 --> 01:47:43,530
I in trump,
like trump being hated an independent.

2370
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:46,560
It doesn't help ordinary people because 
he's.

2371
01:47:46,561 --> 01:47:47,220
He's,
he's,

2372
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:51,720
he's bringing jobs back to America.
We were selling our soul overseas and we

2373
01:47:51,721 --> 01:47:53,820
were there teaching us to hate being 
American.

2374
01:47:53,821 --> 01:47:57,420
That teaching on industrializing are 
actually factories and manufacturing.

2375
01:47:57,421 --> 01:48:00,870
Jobs are coming back and people don't 
really true though,

2376
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:04,200
because you know how they let you work 
in politics more than I do.

2377
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:05,700
You know,
it's like a game.

2378
01:48:05,950 --> 01:48:08,010
You know,
there's not a lot of truth in that world

2379
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:09,300
alive aside.
Well,

2380
01:48:09,301 --> 01:48:09,620
I,
I,

2381
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:10,453
it's not that different.
That's why I travel six days a week and 

2382
01:48:13,381 --> 01:48:15,480
I traveled to every state,
even to Hawaii.

2383
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:19,890
The love and comfort in your life.
Who looks after you?

2384
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:22,080
I can't,
I can't.

2385
01:48:22,150 --> 01:48:22,983
She snapped her.

2386
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,350
You know,
her name is bear.

2387
01:48:25,820 --> 01:48:30,240
Hey,
bear really have so much in common.

2388
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:31,110
Well,
yes,

2389
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:33,780
but also my bear will beat your barrier.
Disagree?

2390
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:37,230
I don't think so because he's like a mad
woman for cat or fast.

2391
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:38,433
She left.
Ally takes out a wall at the top of the 

2392
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:43,550
top of the food chain because you know 
what the problem is?

2393
01:48:43,551 --> 01:48:44,690
Is that a,
um,

2394
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:46,850
that dog is a painting.
Well,

2395
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:48,390
I'm not gonna get into the dock.
We've got sandwiched.

2396
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:50,030
Painted nails.
Important though.

2397
01:48:50,031 --> 01:48:53,990
We should maybe another time.
One of these days when people.

2398
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:57,140
Are you pretty strong when them people 
are protesting,

2399
01:48:57,390 --> 01:48:58,340
you know,
your career,

2400
01:48:58,370 --> 01:48:59,190
your,
uh,

2401
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:00,023
like I've watched some videos where 
there's people protesting the back and 

2402
01:49:02,071 --> 01:49:04,060
stuff.
You hold yourself together world.

2403
01:49:04,061 --> 01:49:06,060
Oh yeah.
They're totally like insane.

2404
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:08,840
But then you feel like,
why don't,

2405
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:12,510
why don't you feel like this is what I 
feel like I watched,

2406
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:13,373
like right when people,
because I'm fascinated and I kind of 

2407
01:49:15,481 --> 01:49:17,490
admire the bravery I got to say that.

2408
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:18,663
Um,
but do not feel like that you want to 

2409
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:24,090
receive and give love to people.
Does that not,

2410
01:49:24,150 --> 01:49:26,390
is that not sort of high on your agenda?
No,

2411
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,360
of course it is.
And I do.

2412
01:49:27,361 --> 01:49:31,050
I received so much love because once 
people have this political awakening,

2413
01:49:31,210 --> 01:49:32,043
um,
and they realized that everything has 

2414
01:49:33,151 --> 01:49:33,984
been sold to them as lie.
Nothing feels better than self 

2415
01:49:35,441 --> 01:49:37,380
empowerment.
Actually feeling like you can do it when

2416
01:49:37,381 --> 01:49:38,700
it comes within you,
you know,

2417
01:49:38,701 --> 01:49:42,000
he is a strong emotion but doesn't feel 
as good as love.

2418
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:43,073
You know,
saying my life sucks because of all of 

2419
01:49:45,001 --> 01:49:45,834
you.
It doesn't feel as good as saying I can 

2420
01:49:47,291 --> 01:49:50,680
do anything.
Of course when you mean personal value,

2421
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:51,753
but like,
but like that is not the clearest and 

2422
01:49:53,351 --> 01:49:57,340
most obvious manifestation manifestation
of love from my family.

2423
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:58,273
Do you?
That's good.

2424
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:02,560
Because the most obvious manifestation 
of love that I can think of is to accept

2425
01:50:02,561 --> 01:50:05,860
and understand other people that people 
have had different experiences to you in

2426
01:50:05,861 --> 01:50:06,694
life and that of course,
and I accept that we're always going to 

2427
01:50:09,431 --> 01:50:10,450
have different experiences.

2428
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:11,283
That's called life.
You can't create a system where 

2429
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:15,080
everybody is equal.
It doesn't exist in module ring,

2430
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:16,900
right?
It just doesn't exist.

2431
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:20,770
That's utopia there though before we got
the fire station.

2432
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:23,520
But yeah,
I mean I,

2433
01:50:23,521 --> 01:50:26,020
I look for love in my personal life.
I don't look for love in my,

2434
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:29,200
in my political life.
I understand that when you know your why

2435
01:50:29,201 --> 01:50:30,034
should,
why should the political will be 

2436
01:50:30,881 --> 01:50:34,140
exempted.
We're human beings because what I,

2437
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:38,260
what I am doing is giving them the power
to go into their personal lives and,

2438
01:50:38,261 --> 01:50:39,094
and,
and feel cold beer candies is what 

2439
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:44,490
you're actually doing is wrangling them 
into this,

2440
01:50:44,550 --> 01:50:45,383
into sort of a corralling them into a 
position where the most powerful people 

2441
01:50:49,181 --> 01:50:51,310
in the world can continue to benefit 
from them.

2442
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:54,250
Because whilst I agree that there are 
bogus sort of lefty,

2443
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:55,113
Democrat people that contribute a lot to
the debate and I don't support the sort 

2444
01:50:58,421 --> 01:50:59,254
of the,
the mainstream media and the narratives 

2445
01:51:02,231 --> 01:51:03,064
that they put forward in like the cuffs 
in new arguing very articulately and 

2446
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:08,470
brilliantly with people,
I feel that the most people,

2447
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:11,240
powerful people in the world will 
benefit if other.

2448
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:12,093
If people believe in individual power,
people do need to collect the virus to 

2449
01:51:14,411 --> 01:51:18,310
challenge power is the only way we can 
ever change the collectivization.

2450
01:51:18,311 --> 01:51:19,930
That's the APP.
I believe that that's a terrible,

2451
01:51:19,931 --> 01:51:23,280
terrible thing for community is what we 
fall.

2452
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:26,020
Even communities,
of course by collectivism,

2453
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:30,880
collectivism leads to communism.
So I think it's important to acknowledge

2454
01:51:30,881 --> 01:51:31,714
the individuals to be the same as the 
big argument is we don't have to be 

2455
01:51:34,901 --> 01:51:37,630
defined by our history that we can 
create new futures,

2456
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:38,583
so collective and community based 
ideologies need and automatically lead 

2457
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:46,260
to state communism in the Gulag.
For me though,

2458
01:51:46,510 --> 01:51:49,660
I only spent 10 minutes and I thought it
was going quite well.

2459
01:51:50,890 --> 01:51:53,170
We had a lovely Democrat community.

2460
01:51:55,220 --> 01:51:57,300
You did okay,
but you,

2461
01:51:57,301 --> 01:51:58,390
you couldn't,
you couldn't,

2462
01:51:58,640 --> 01:51:59,473
you know,
say what the role of government was 

2463
01:52:00,671 --> 01:52:02,360
going to be and I'm telling you,
look it,

2464
01:52:02,370 --> 01:52:06,430
it's,
it's hard to say with the snowflakes,

2465
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:07,620
okay,
you and I meditate.

2466
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:10,000
We're not special.
Snowflakes were not original.

2467
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:15,020
Every system has turned into nuts.
It's been.

2468
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:19,720
It's been trying to be a blizzard.
Storm,

2469
01:52:21,530 --> 01:52:23,850
snow cats where you are.
There's no question.

2470
01:52:24,110 --> 01:52:25,240
That's what I am.
Very,

2471
01:52:25,241 --> 01:52:26,074
very wonderful bug.
Think you must be a bit more kind to 

2472
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,113
people.
Compassionate for people that feel like 

2473
01:52:32,110 --> 01:52:34,090
in my face,
calling me a white supremacist.

2474
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:35,293
It's not nice to Shriek at people.
I agree with you to find compassion in 

2475
01:52:37,811 --> 01:52:40,390
my belly when I'm being shrieked and 
called the white supremacists.

2476
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:43,450
Somebody read a guardian or don't get 
angry.

2477
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:45,890
What did our Lord do?
He fat.

2478
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:48,590
Forgive them.
They know not what they do.

2479
01:52:48,770 --> 01:52:50,630
Forgiveness,
endless forgiveness,

2480
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:52,270
endless love.
I do love life.

2481
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:53,143
You've been put in a position of power.
Then you have an obligation to be 

2482
01:52:56,190 --> 01:52:58,010
loving.
That's your first obligation,

2483
01:52:58,020 --> 01:52:58,853
right?
Not to be a practical because I don't 

2484
01:53:00,231 --> 01:53:02,130
think you've been given her enough love 
in this grand.

2485
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:05,660
Sounds absolutely amazing that when 
you're a little kid,

2486
01:53:05,690 --> 01:53:09,340
I don't mean now all that crap in the 
media and I love it.

2487
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:10,370
Sounds amazing.
Yeah.

2488
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:14,480
But with this guy,
I know my grandma who passed Nola,

2489
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:17,750
Nolan rock sound terrific.
People such,

2490
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:22,110
you know,
like they say that they're there.

2491
01:53:22,111 --> 01:53:22,944
Um,
well because I was trying to assert 

2492
01:53:23,871 --> 01:53:24,704
control in my life and,
and that was the way that I dealt with 

2493
01:53:27,051 --> 01:53:28,100
it.
But I mean I have.

2494
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:29,470
What about other people who have gotten 
a wreck?

2495
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:30,890
Shit.
What'd you start to them back up?

2496
01:53:31,810 --> 01:53:32,900
You wouldn't say that.
No,

2497
01:53:32,901 --> 01:53:34,100
I understand it.

2498
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:34,933
Obviously on a more.
In the same way that you would 

2499
01:53:35,751 --> 01:53:39,020
understand drug addiction on a more 
molecular level because you've lived it.

2500
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:42,650
I would tell them that they need to 
identify what they're trying to control.

2501
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:44,390
When I'm talking to drug addicts,
I say this,

2502
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:47,090
some were wearing new.
You do not think that you are beautiful.

2503
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:47,953
You have been hurt.
There is a way out of this pain for 

2504
01:53:49,941 --> 01:53:52,760
spiritual connection to one another 
through service,

2505
01:53:52,761 --> 01:53:53,594
through higher ideals,
to recognize your own beauty and to 

2506
01:53:55,701 --> 01:53:57,090
realize it.
That's the sort of thing,

2507
01:53:57,091 --> 01:53:58,430
and I have to say to them,
right,

2508
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:03,580
it's not God different though.
I'm sure it is.

2509
01:54:03,741 --> 01:54:05,510
I don't.
I can't give that pep speech.

2510
01:54:05,511 --> 01:54:07,540
They look at you and they'd be like,
yeah,

2511
01:54:07,541 --> 01:54:09,400
no,
they'd be the anorexics.

2512
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:11,800
I've never known such complexity.
Yeah,

2513
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:14,480
it's very complex.
It really is,

2514
01:54:14,481 --> 01:54:18,410
but I have to believe that love is more 
important than hate.

2515
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:21,810
That unity and togetherness.
More powerful than individually,

2516
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:23,690
but it.
But once you.

2517
01:54:23,691 --> 01:54:25,650
Once you.
You have to empower anybody videos.

2518
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:27,650
I do not want to be the same person that
you are.

2519
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,460
I don't want to be treated like where 
the same person.

2520
01:54:29,490 --> 01:54:32,120
I don't want to be the same person that 
a person around me is.

2521
01:54:32,121 --> 01:54:35,330
I don't want to be treated as if we're 
the exact same person and you can cookie

2522
01:54:35,331 --> 01:54:37,220
cut society and say,
Oh,

2523
01:54:37,221 --> 01:54:39,380
this is what Qantas likes for breakfast,
so that must be.

2524
01:54:39,381 --> 01:54:41,480
We're all just going to have the same 
cereal for breakfast.

2525
01:54:41,481 --> 01:54:45,320
I don't like that we are individuals.
You should celebrate the individual.

2526
01:54:45,550 --> 01:54:46,383
The individual should come together and 
form a community that takes care of 

2527
01:54:48,651 --> 01:54:50,840
issues for individuals.
I can't take care of themselves.

2528
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,600
That's a good idea.
Now this,

2529
01:54:53,601 --> 01:54:54,434
um,
would you be willing if over time when 

2530
01:54:57,171 --> 01:55:00,170
human beings come up with better ideas,
as human beings evolve,

2531
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:03,620
if better ideas than free market 
capitalism were to emerge,

2532
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:05,420
would you be open to those ideas?

2533
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:08,330
I love ideas.
If there was something better,

2534
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:14,060
a better idea then globalized free 
market capitalism exists in the realm of

2535
01:55:14,061 --> 01:55:14,894
infinite possibility through which all 
realized it must have surely have 

2536
01:55:18,411 --> 01:55:20,900
traveled.
There exists now,

2537
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:23,630
better ideas,
ideas that are more fair,

2538
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:26,510
more just they are there waiting to 
happen,

2539
01:55:26,511 --> 01:55:29,450
these ideas and when they arrive,
which they will,

2540
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:33,620
you will be open to them.
I will be the first person that opens my

2541
01:55:33,621 --> 01:55:34,454
loving arms and says,
come here and new idea that's going to 

2542
01:55:36,471 --> 01:55:41,471
fix everything.
And then we probably just need 10,

2543
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:47,540
15 minutes with my pant and be willing 
to in that direction.

2544
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:49,573
Alright,
well I think we've done as much as we 

2545
01:55:50,881 --> 01:55:54,050
can given the limitations that we're 
obviously working with them.

2546
01:55:54,051 --> 01:55:54,900
What do you think,
candice?

2547
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:56,073
It's been lovely.
Been good at it because we're 

2548
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:01,110
essentially disagree on almost 
everything.

2549
01:56:01,111 --> 01:56:03,300
Then agree quite strongly on some 
things.

2550
01:56:03,310 --> 01:56:04,990
Right.
Well what is.

2551
01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:07,860
I've just taken a step further like you 
actually agree with me.

2552
01:56:07,861 --> 01:56:08,694
I'd absolutely.
Everything that I'm saying you just 

2553
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:11,360
have.
You just had it plugged it in.

2554
01:56:12,210 --> 01:56:16,620
You just haven't plugged it in to 
realize that it's actually a capitalist,

2555
01:56:16,621 --> 01:56:17,454
not crony capitalism,
but a capitalist society with free 

2556
01:56:19,141 --> 01:56:20,910
markets that helps with people out of 
poverty.

2557
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:23,340
It's one steps off and these massive 
regulation.

2558
01:56:23,341 --> 01:56:26,760
We've seen the results of that walk in,
walk in,

2559
01:56:26,910 --> 01:56:29,070
and then I took one step and you're here
and I'm like,

2560
01:56:30,510 --> 01:56:34,380
come back to us.
So hopefully I helped you a little bit.

2561
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:39,330
See what can you wish your absolutely 
charming.

2562
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:42,950
That was amazing.
Thank you.

2563
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:43,883
Fucking

2564
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:45,143
awesome.
