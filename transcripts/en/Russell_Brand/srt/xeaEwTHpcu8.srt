Luke harding is a British author and 
foreign correspondent for the Guardian,

who's reported from Delhi,
Berlin,

3
00:00:06,011 --> 00:00:08,620
and Moscow,
and covered wars in Afghanistan

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,640
rack

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,473
and Libya.
His books include Mafia state in which 

6
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:14,014
he discusses his experience in Russia 
and the political system and the 

7
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:20,410
Vladimir Putin as well as the snowden 
files.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,743
Very expensive poison.
And His latest a New York Times number 

9
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:29,380
one bestseller,
collusion secret meetings,

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,423
the Imani and how Russia helped Donald 
Trump when at a book that has captured 

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,380
the imagination of the United States of 
America is doing phenomenally well.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,170
Right.
Tell me why this book is so successful,

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,063
please.

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,303
Okay.
I think because it tells the Russian 

15
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,370
half of the story.
Basically we have a,

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,813
a conspiracy,
you can call it an alleged conspiracy 

17
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,660
involving a group of Americans,
many working for,

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,513
for,
for trump's campaign and indeed 

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,180
allegedly trump himself and,
and a group of Russians.

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,370
And,
um,

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,590
quite a lot is known about the Americans
and the story about Donald Trump,

22
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:08,550
his son,
Donald Trump,

23
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:12,120
jr jared Kushner,
the president's son of Noah and so on.

24
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:14,580
But,
but less is known about the oligarchs,

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,870
the intelligence officers.
Uh,

26
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:20,190
and also the fact that the,
the what happened last year,

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,360
um,
owes a big debt to,

28
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:23,194
to the Cold War.
And I would say to the methods of the 

29
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:26,304
KGB,

30
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,723
well,
this,

31
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:29,943
um,
obviously intrigued because while you 

32
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:36,850
were explaining that it's becomes clear 
that what we're talking about is the,

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,833
is how power operates covertly and the 
kind of alliances that are formed in 

34
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:43,564
order to achieve power sometimes and con
as in this case unconventional or at 

35
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:53,710
least novel relationship.
So to explain to me,

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,420
uh,
please look,

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,080
what are the key relationships that 
determining trump's ascent?

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,560
Well,
the story goes back a long way,

39
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:08,430
but I think to explain it in a way you 
need to kind of explain how,

40
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,290
how,
how Vladimir Putin thinks.

41
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,300
And I'm not a,
I'm not a psychologist,

42
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:16,140
but I spent four years in Moscow working
as a correspondent between 2007 or 2011.

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,860
And I kind of got to know their kind of 
rather dark techniques,

44
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:20,960
if you like.
And um,

45
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,590
the thing about Vladimir Putin is he's,
he's a kind of classic KGB spy.

46
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,730
Um,
he,

47
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,120
he spent his career in the KGB,
some of it in communist East Germany.

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,313
And he's going to worldview is,
is predicated on the idea that America 

49
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:37,850
is the enemy,
which quite often during the cold war,

50
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:38,840
it was,
um,

51
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,380
that Russia is encircled by hostile 
forces,

52
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,870
um,
and wanting the kgb used to do a lot of,

53
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:45,704
is to try and influence politics in the 
West European politics and American 

54
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:50,750
politics in particular,
and,

55
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,800
and to device kind of strategies.
And,

56
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:53,634
and the,
the funny thing is that generally these 

57
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:58,980
operations back in the 1980s were not 
terribly,

58
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,573
but the age of facebook and twitter plus
the fact that there are all of these 

59
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,040
divisions in America Anyway,
um,

60
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,530
I think really open up all sorts of 
possibilities,

61
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,053
especially with Donald Trump who,
who for Vladimir Putin was the perfect 

62
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,294
candidate.

63
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,583
So what we ha ha what you're saying is 
that because of [inaudible] experience 

64
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,510
as a politician and as a sort of a 
covert agent,

65
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,583
you have a type of politics that we w is
what more covert then it would usually 

66
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:33,200
be.
What is it that is,

67
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,453
why is it significant that uh,
like a president comes to power via 

68
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:41,180
relationships with a,
a previous Lee,

69
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,083
a state that it was previously an 
opposition to rather than say through 

70
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:48,410
alliances with transnational 
corporations that have explicit interest

71
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:50,750
in the country where the president is a 
diego?

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,240
Well,
I'm going to,

73
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,470
I think transnational corporations don't
hack stuff.

74
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,483
Uh,
now a lot of people are kind of the 

75
00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:58,970
Americans hack stuff,
that British hack stuff,

76
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,433
the Russians hack stuff.
I think what was different about the 

77
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,510
election last year was that,
that um,

78
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,583
it,
if you believe Washington that 

79
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,413
essentially kind of crammed in hackers 
or quite often these guys are sort of 

80
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:13,080
freelances cooptive by the state,
um,

81
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,640
broken to Democratic Party servers into 
Hillary Clinton's campaign.

82
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,893
And by the way,
and to kind of Donald Trump's campaign 

83
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,100
as well.
And they just released one set of emails

84
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,670
at moments of kind of maximum 
embarrassment for,

85
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,970
for Hillary.
Um,

86
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,350
in the summer of last year.
Just Push,

87
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,790
you had a kind of convention and again 
in October and what,

88
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,793
we can't say that that trump one thanks 
to booton but what we can say was that 

89
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:37,594
Putin was kind of pushing,
trying to push them across the line and 

90
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,570
the v these kinds of kind of hacks 
helped that.

91
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,440
Now you might say,
well you know everyone hacks,

92
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:46,940
that's true,
but this,

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,620
this was a kind of an attempt if you 
like,

94
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,400
to kind of influence the domestic 
political process from far away.

95
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:54,680
So I think it was kind of different.
And I also think it was

96
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,783
spectacularly successful.
And I suppose it's surprising because 

97
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,113
America is usually a country where it is
generally they like to be the people 

98
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:03,334
that's doing the influencing of other 
peoples national politics as opposed to 

99
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,703
being the recipient or the victim of.
So I suppose what within it is the idea 

100
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:16,720
that power on a geopolitical level is 
shifting.

101
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,550
Is that something that's interesting 
about it?

102
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,460
Well,
I,

103
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,293
I think it's,
I think it's not so much that kind of 

104
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:23,990
power is shifting because Russia,
let's face it,

105
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,810
it's not an especially powerful country.
It's still a nuclear armed state.

106
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,120
Uh,
and it has got plenty of tanks,

107
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:29,571
but,
but,

108
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:30,970
but economically it's,
it's not,

109
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,430
not a pass and it hasn't really,
in terms of ideas,

110
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:36,140
it hasn't really kind of developed any 
great ideas.

111
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:36,974
I think what it is is it's actually a 
story about opportunism that if you are 

112
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:45,050
a kind of unscrupulous,
sort of sovereign power,

113
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,063
um,
that you can do a lot of stuff quite 

114
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:49,130
cheaply.
I mean,

115
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:49,431
the,
the,

116
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:52,170
the hacking for example,
was done with phishing emails that,

117
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:54,830
that people clicked on in the middle of 
the night when they were half asleep.

118
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,263
Um,
and some of the other stuff kind of 

119
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:58,244
relatively low budget,
but it's about this sort of classic kgb 

120
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:03,110
doctrine.
It's about exploiting,

121
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,921
um,
the,

122
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:06,830
the kind of weakness in western society 
and turning it to your own advantage.

123
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,320
Um,
I mean I'm not saying preaching can have

124
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:11,960
created all the problems in America that
they preexisted him,

125
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:14,210
but he certainly kind of took advantage 
of it.

126
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,620
I see.
And I suppose perspective I have is that

127
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:21,454
there's trump obviously anybody who's 
interested in politics and current 

128
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:27,940
affairs,
he's sort of this wonderfully new,

129
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:28,774
grotesque,
grotesque Avatar upon which we can sort 

130
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:34,690
of hang our intrigue and our 
fascination.

131
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,003
But for like,
and then I'm really interested because 

132
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:40,640
of the depth of your experiences of 
journalists,

133
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,920
the time you've spent in Russia or 
knowledge of the Edward Snowden case.

134
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:48,921
What is it that in particular about 
trump is a distressing it cause like for

135
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:51,084
me,
it's personally without their breadth 

136
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:52,734
and depth of knowledge that you have,
it seems that he's merely an 

137
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:59,901
amplification of preexisting phenomena.
Just more visible version of what's been

138
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,880
sort of happening anyway.

139
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,200
Yeah.
Well,

140
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,460
I mean I think that's true,
but,

141
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:07,470
but he's also someone,
um,

142
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,543
who the the savior state and it's rushed
and successor was very keen to 

143
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,790
cultivate.
I mean,

144
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,700
this is a matter of facts and history 
and,

145
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:20,100
and the thing is that we're supposed to 
keep on talking about the Cold War,

146
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:22,290
but Donald Trump does something fairly 
unused.

147
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,124
In the 1970s,
he married a woman from communist 

148
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,374
Czechoslovakia and we know from the 
classical art do classified archive 

149
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:29,244
material that sort of checks spies,
catch a very close eye on the couple in 

150
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,390
Manhattan.
And,

151
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,710
um,
uh,

152
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,760
talk to Ivanna's father who still live 
behind the iron curtain.

153
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,293
And,
and whatever they had on the trumps 

154
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:45,340
would have been fed to,
to Moscow is part of a kind of a routine

155
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,270
thing.
Um,

156
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,780
and you then fast forward to 1987 and 
the,

157
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,540
the citizen Soviet government invites 
Donald Trump to,

158
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,510
to visit Moscow and an all expenses paid
trip.

159
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,543
And that was one of the things I kind of
discovered was that the Soviet 

160
00:07:58,691 --> 00:07:59,524
ambassador literally got off a plane 
from Moscow to New York when with his 

161
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:05,170
daughter to trump tower,
saw Mr.

162
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,630
Trump and said,
ms,

163
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,300
Mr.
Trump,

164
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,500
you have the most beautiful building in 
America,

165
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,000
you know,
and sort of schmoozed him.

166
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:14,190
He did the kind of schmoozy thing.
Would it be susceptible to schmooze?

167
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:17,560
You say the daughter said it was like 
honey to a bee,

168
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,830
basically that trump kind of melted 
that,

169
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:22,030
that he liked this kind of flattery and 
recognition.

170
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,193
There was a series of lunches and then 
an official invite the Soviet 

171
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:25,990
government,
you know,

172
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,250
we'll bring you to Moscow,
et cetera.

173
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,680
Now what sort of significant about that?
I mean two things.

174
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:31,310
First of all,
the people who are arranged as travel,

175
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,480
where intourist now interests was a 
Soviet travel agency.

176
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,800
It was basically the KGB.

177
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,380
I spoken to kind of defectors who,
who've say,

178
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,273
you know,
that the travel agency was the kgb so 

179
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:43,060
that we can say without being 
hyperbolic,

180
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:45,580
the KGB brought Donald Trump to Moscow 
in 1987.

181
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,863
Um,
and then he was staying just off Red 

182
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,010
Square,
not far away from,

183
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,560
from dead Lenin and from,
from sort of famous sort of pantheons of

184
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:54,920
Soviet heroes.
And they're,

185
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,690
his room would've been bugged.
Allegedly he was,

186
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,720
he was discussing hotel building.
But in reality this was a classic,

187
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,910
it's cool to kind of cultivation 
exercise.

188
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:06,641
It doesn't mean that,
that,

189
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:09,660
that he was recruited and was kind of 
striding round,

190
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:10,494
red square wearing a colonel's uniform.
But it means that they were interested 

191
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:13,980
in him.
Um,

192
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,873
and we also know from kind of leaked 
papers from that period why they were 

193
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:18,204
interested in him.
They were basically the head of the KGB 

194
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:21,840
was berating,
uh,

195
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,703
his,
his office is all around the world 

196
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:24,060
saying,
you know,

197
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,040
we need to do more to recruit Americans.

198
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,203
And they circulated a personality 
questionnaire for the kind of people 

199
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:32,250
they were interested in.
They wanted people who were vein,

200
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,780
uh,
ambitious,

201
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,620
narcissistic,
um,

202
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,870
you know,
adulterous,

203
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:38,790
perhaps had affairs that could be 
exploited.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,833
We're poor analysts and so on.
And you kind of work your way down the 

205
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,670
list.
And Mr.

206
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,301
Trump,
God bless him,

207
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:48,870
ticks every single box.
So the thing is there's a,

208
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:49,883
there's a big backstory.
I've kind of courtship now that doesn't 

209
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:54,810
mean that,
I mean,

210
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:57,780
we don't know to what degree trump kind 
of cooperative enormous.

211
00:09:57,781 --> 00:09:58,614
But what,
what is very curious is after this kind 

212
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,224
of trip,
about six weeks later when he's back in 

213
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:04,164
the u s he takes out a series of front 
page adverts in three newspapers 

214
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:11,160
criticizing Ronald Reagan's foreign 
policy and he announces,

215
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,413
wait for this,
he's thinking about running for 

216
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:15,360
president.
It doesn't happen.

217
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,223
Soviet Union collapses and his blood 
ambitions take another kind of three 

218
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:20,070
decades to flourish.

219
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,500
But what you have to understand is that 
these techniques,

220
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,281
meanwhile,
patients,

221
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,540
niece Jeremy trying to do the same 
thing,

222
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,760
he's trying to recruit students from 
national America.

223
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,900
The,
the,

224
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,810
these techniques are old techniques 
updated for,

225
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,430
for 2016,
2017.

226
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,020
When you say these techniques,
the do you mean the relationship between

227
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,570
Russia and trump and trump's,
uh,

228
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,400
sort of aggressive antiestablishment 
announcement.

229
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,323
I mean,
the kind of wooing of people who might 

230
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:48,060
be useful.
And it's a bit like,

231
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,923
it's not that the Soviet intelligence 
knew 30 years ago he'd be president of 

232
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:53,070
United States,
of course not.

233
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,263
But they saw he had possibilities that 
he might be interesting and he with a 

234
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,824
range of targets.
But what's interesting is that trump 

235
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:01,464
keeps coming back to Moscow does again 
in the 90s and then most famously he 

236
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:07,290
does it in 2013 when he hosted the Miss 
Universe beauty contest.

237
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,453
And he's hanging out with oligarchs with
mafia guys where people from the 

238
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:14,340
presidential administration,
all of whom are slapping him on the back

239
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,174
and,
and,

240
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,430
and really,
um,

241
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,800
if you believe the,
the famous dossier by Christopher Steel,

242
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:21,840
the sort of British spy who set this 
whole thing off,

243
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,973
the kind of the cultivation operation 
resumed big time about five years ago 

244
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,300
and culminated with the Russians helping
him.

245
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,850
Um,
I'm not saying they made him win because

246
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:35,340
millions of people voted for him,
but helping them,

247
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,280
helping them across the finishing line 
in last year's presidential election.

248
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,493
Yeah,
because it does seem like obviously the 

249
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:46,080
fruition of a 30 year relationship,
it seems sort of on off,

250
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,940
I mean there's not continuous but on and
off because prior to the election,

251
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,160
the relationship between sort of covert

252
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,993
relationships between Russia and the 
figures in American public life wasn't 

253
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:01,190
really a story that we were that 
interested in.

254
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:02,050
Is it,
is it something that you,

255
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,100
what,
what now is because it wasn't happening?

256
00:12:04,101 --> 00:12:07,370
I mean that there hadn't been prayed 
successful and um,

257
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,121
with,
with,

258
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:09,350
with trump,
I mean it was,

259
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:09,831
I,
I've talked,

260
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:10,664
I've talked to Americans who are kind of
in the intelligence world are more or 

261
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:14,834
less doffing their hat and saying this 
is one of the greatest espionage 

262
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,180
operations we ever seen.
I mean,

263
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:18,860
they,
they,

264
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,693
they admit it was kind of breathtaking 
and when I was a writing my book as 

265
00:12:22,821 --> 00:12:23,461
well,
it's trying to write,

266
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:26,690
I kind of thriller because it is a 
thriller or that sort of true there,

267
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,533
there were a couple of questions to 
answer and one of them is why is Donald 

268
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,940
Trump's so nice about Vladimir Putin?
When you say rude about everybody,

269
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:35,774
I,
I don't know if he's been rude about 

270
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:36,824
you,
but he's been rude about Theresa May 

271
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:39,440
last week.
He's been rude about the Germans.

272
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,330
He's rude about his Republican Party 
allies.

273
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:43,910
He's worried about everybody.
But the only constant thing that the sun

274
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:47,090
rising in the morning is that,
that he's always nice about Mr Putin.

275
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,690
He says he's very smart.
He says he believes him.

276
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:51,171
When,
when,

277
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,100
when Putin says,
you know,

278
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:54,110
I had nothing to do with the hacking.
Donald,

279
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,430
I believe him.
Well,

280
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,460
no one else does that.
Seemingly he believes the KGB Asian,

281
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,000
the x one.
Um,

282
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,123
and this is very strange and I can kind 
of predict confidently the trump will 

283
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:05,660
never criticize Putin.
And you have to ask yourself,

284
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,000
why is that?
And the answer,

285
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:11,780
at least according to the steele dossier
is because the Russians have got a whole

286
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:12,614
load of compromising material.
It's called Kompromat on trump dating 

287
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:21,250
back to the 1980s technical stuff,
readouts of his conversations,

288
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,040
agents,
reports,

289
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,550
um,
and uh,

290
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,540
and also allegations that the trump 
watch to kind of exotic sex show when he

291
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,690
was in Moscow in 2013,
which mail month may not be true.

292
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:33,520
But nonetheless,
at the end of the day,

293
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,310
patient has enormous leverage over the 
president of the United States.

294
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,660
And that's a remarkable thing.

295
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,820
It is remarkable,
uh,

296
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,310
is it seems,
um,

297
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,690
gosh,
compromise.

298
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,740
I can't imagine what

299
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,083
compromising material would be 
constituted of given the stuff that 

300
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,910
explicitly like says himself,
like under stuff that bounces off him.

301
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,453
You know,
is it,

302
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,353
I suppose what's difficult about what's 
challenging or in treat part or part of 

303
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:02,680
the intrigue?
Is it,

304
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,583
like you said,
it's like the reference points are like 

305
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,010
the 1980s in the Cold War and John Le 
Carre's rent to you,

306
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:13,810
it seems there's something slightly 
nostalgic but then the entire atmosphere

307
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,800
of the type of,
uh,

308
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,653
sort of ethno nationalism and they're 
sort of bravado of trump and sort of a 

309
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,290
other emergent strands of nationalistic 
politics,

310
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:27,190
they all swear seem to have something 
quite retrospective about them.

311
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,293
So it's an extraordinary move mood,
a mood that seems to be a prevailing at 

312
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:34,870
the moment.
I suppose.

313
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:35,750
What's,
um,

314
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,780
like you have mentioned what's 
interesting to me,

315
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:39,970
it's like millions of people did vote 
for Donald Trump.

316
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,013
The,
the idea of Russian intervention prior 

317
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:48,781
to this would've seemed kind of bizarre.
And like,

318
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,700
obviously this is a very well researched
and you're obviously right,

319
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:57,701
but what I suppose is like interesting 
to me is what are the other reasons that

320
00:14:58,011 --> 00:15:00,920
somebody like Donald Trump would become 
president?

321
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:05,921
What kind of culture becomes susceptible
to a figure like Donald Trump?

322
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:07,730
What does it tell us?
I mean,

323
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,683
do you think that the,
that the involve that your book is 

324
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,660
saying that without the involvement of 
Russia,

325
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,920
he would not have Donald Trump as

326
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,470
the president of the United States and 
that's what we should focus on it?

327
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:20,871
No,
I'm not,

328
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:21,704
I'm not quite,
I'm not quite saying that because I 

329
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:23,880
think,
I think it's going to multicultural.

330
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,714
There have,
there are all sorts of reasons and as 

331
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,490
you say,
um,

332
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,740
millions of people voted for him and 
clearly it's got a lot to do with,

333
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:34,250
with post 2008 with the financial crash.
You mentioned global corporations,

334
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:35,084
the fact that there are large numbers of
people who just feel they've been kind 

335
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:38,894
of cheated by the system and saw trump 
has some kind of alternative and all of 

336
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:46,450
that is right and all of that.
It's got nothing to do with Russia bat.

337
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,573
It's also true that the hacking of this 
democratic party stuff really helped 

338
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:53,394
him.
I mean it was a beautiful kind of 

339
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:55,500
campaign weapon.
It sorts,

340
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,110
it sort of undermined hillary.
And I'm,

341
00:15:58,111 --> 00:16:01,380
the curious thing about this whole story
is that I'm pretty certain,

342
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,390
and also having spoken to lots of people
in Moscow,

343
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,830
uh,
that,

344
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,410
uh,
Putin didn't think that trump would win.

345
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,600
He was the kind of,
for the Russians,

346
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,434
he was the kind of candidate of chaos.
He was the guy who was going to 

347
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,110
discredit hillary so that when she 
became president,

348
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,980
she would be weak.
She would,

349
00:16:16,981 --> 00:16:19,950
she would be on the back foot.
And meanwhile,

350
00:16:19,951 --> 00:16:23,220
leaving Russia free to do what it likes 
on the international stage.

351
00:16:23,221 --> 00:16:24,180
Now,
of course,

352
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:26,910
they kind of blew the doors off and 
trump became president.

353
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,080
And,
um,

354
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,420
that was great.
And so far as the,

355
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,673
I launched my book in the New New York,
but this kind of atmosphere of hyper 

356
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:37,530
partisanship in the states is absolutely
kind of raging.

357
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,680
So all of that chaos is good for Putin.
But on the other hand,

358
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:41,514
the one thing he really wanted was for,
for America under trump to lift 

359
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,204
sanctions against Russia,
imposed Auntie in 2014 by Obama 

360
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,570
following the war in Ukraine.
And that hasn't happened because there's

361
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:53,404
scandal is just turned into her 
monstrously big thing and is being 

362
00:16:57,611 --> 00:16:58,444
investigated by Robert Miller who is,
who is kind of beating a path to trump 

363
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:03,324
story.
He's the special prosecutor looking at 

364
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:04,944
all this stuff.

365
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,160
Um,
my concern is,

366
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,240
is that in this diagnosis of Russian 
involvement being integral to the ascent

367
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:19,010
of trump,
other lessons may be missed,

368
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,873
like you said,
about the partner Zan atmosphere in 

369
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:22,244
America.
I was recently in America and I sort of 

370
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,320
sensed a similar thing.
Um,

371
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,470
do you think that this sort of,
um,

372
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:35,010
kind of willingness to blame,
like getting it all be it like,

373
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:35,651
you know,
like,

374
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:36,540
uh,
like I said to you,

375
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,374
it's obvious from the,
the steele report and the work that you 

376
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:41,700
have done that there is truth in what 
you're saying,

377
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:42,923
but,
um,

378
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,183
you know,
like,

379
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,893
do you think that there's a sort of a,
possibly a sort of a kind of a desire 

380
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,333
democratic left sort of center,
left leaning liberal thinking people 

381
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:58,080
just to sort of find a reason why,
why Donald Trump is president?

382
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,093
There isn't because of the massive 
failure of liberalism to take care of 

383
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:05,520
the people that it was supposed to 
represent.

384
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,071
Yeah.
I,

385
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:07,970
I'm a,
I mean I get that and I think your,

386
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,760
your,
I think you're basically correct,

387
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:12,030
but,
but it's,

388
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:14,520
it's a complex world and two things can 
be true simultaneously.

389
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,160
Liberalism as you put it,
may have failed.

390
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,460
Hillary Clinton may have been a weak 
candidate who fell to inspire.

391
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,353
Um,
Bernie may have been given a tough time 

392
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:24,070
by the Democratic Party.
Uh,

393
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,930
trump,
let's face it,

394
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,820
for all of his,
kind of,

395
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,910
for all of his kind of recklessness that
there is something pretty mesmeric about

396
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:37,090
listening to him speak.
Even if he only says the same thing four

397
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:38,050
or five times.
I mean,

398
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:41,880
he does have,
I kind of rhetorical Pi,

399
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:45,090
you have aura almost.
You have to recognize all of that.

400
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,820
But that doesn't mean that the Russians 
didn't help him.

401
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:48,654
And that the point is that this is sort 
of seriousness that this is sort of 

402
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,220
serious because you think about 
Watergate,

403
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,620
you had one group of Americans,
this is a relatively low tech.

404
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,810
Bloc.
Watergate was the packing room,

405
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,970
his seventies with burglars and rubber 
gloves and lock pigs.

406
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,133
But he had one group of Americans 
smearing another group of Americans in 

407
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:05,610
a,
in a totally disreputable way.

408
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,130
And then Richard Nixon covering up 
afterwards.

409
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,500
What you've got here is one group of 
Americans,

410
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,200
uh,
basically invoking that,

411
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,243
a sort of traditional adversary of the 
United States and getting them to help 

412
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,940
chop the legs off an opponent.
Now,

413
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,070
now that is different territory.
I mean I called my book collusion,

414
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:24,840
but we're sort of,
we're not there yet,

415
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:27,150
but we're kind of heading into the kind 
of treason zone.

416
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,430
It's a lot more serious than a kind of 
domestic political squabble.

417
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:36,230
And I think the worry is,
despite the failure of liberalism as you

418
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:36,860
put it,
is,

419
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,790
is that what it tells us is that our 
democracies are more fragile.

420
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,100
Uh,
two external manipulation of all kinds.

421
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,600
Then we might've thought yes,
but also

422
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,523
like in a way that's quite evident and 
obvious in terms of the experience of 

423
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:54,640
ordinary people in a sort of post 
globalized world.

424
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,271
They like,
you know,

425
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:56,104
cause there's sort of that the,
like the analytical strand that would 

426
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:01,564
demonstrate that would suggest that the 
reason that trump became popular is 

427
00:20:05,111 --> 00:20:09,010
because he's,
it's an emotional experience that people

428
00:20:09,011 --> 00:20:09,844
are voting for trump voters are having.
Like this guy seems to understand how I 

429
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:16,440
feel.
Like what,

430
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,283
while that doesn't make rational sense,
I don't think we're dealing with the 

431
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:21,364
rationale.

432
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,010
Yeah.
But I mean that's,

433
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:23,844
that's the kind of crucial point.
And that in a way is why it's so 

434
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:26,454
alarming is that,
is that that trump has a kind of master 

435
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:29,280
of this emotionalism.
I mean,

436
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:32,820
I've got people kind of one storing my 
review who bought an egg whisk on Amazon

437
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:35,790
and then put one star,
oh my book.

438
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,803
Even though they haven't read it or 
bought it because they just don't like 

439
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:40,550
the idea in it.
And,

440
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:41,550
and it's,
it's,

441
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:44,970
it's the idea that it's not,
it's no more important than what's true.

442
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,013
What's kind of empirically real,
what's important is what people can be 

443
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:49,780
made to believe.
And there's a,

444
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,500
and the thing is,
is a great sort of relativist strand in,

445
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,330
in Russian thinking in Soviet thinking.
I mean,

446
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:56,164
it was Vladimir Lenin,
the guy behind the Bolshevik revolution 

447
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,643
a century ago who basically said that 
that truth was subordinate to the class 

448
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:03,550
struggle.

449
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,550
There was a kind of higher truth which 
out truth,

450
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,860
the real truth of what what's actually 
kind of going on.

451
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,993
And in a way what patient has done is 
sort of cynically take that idea and 

452
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:15,970
reproduce it.
So he doesn't need to persuade everybody

453
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:17,470
that Donald Trump is,
is,

454
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,560
is a great guy and that he's a faithful 
husband and all the rest of it.

455
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,570
But he just needs to kind of persuade a 
certain number of people that that's the

456
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:26,650
case.
And that truth,

457
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:28,240
that becomes a kind of matter.
Truth,

458
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:29,620
it feels still with me.
Um,

459
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,370
and I think it's quite scary because 
ultimately it's a kind of,

460
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,570
where we are now is it's almost like an 
assault on,

461
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,980
on rationality and the idea of a,
of a,

462
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:39,640
of a uni truth,
if that makes sense.

463
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,640
But where does politics have to go?
But that place,

464
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:43,341
you know,
see like the,

465
00:21:43,341 --> 00:21:45,040
in a way they're sort of trees,
like,

466
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,450
you know,
like whether or not it's treason.

467
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:47,843
Literally his treats him for another 
state to intervene in the democratic 

468
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:50,970
process,
uh,

469
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,700
of,
uh,

470
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,660
uh,
second nation.

471
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:53,650
Yes,
of course it is.

472
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,750
But like powerful entities continually 
intervene in the democratic process.

473
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,820
So in a way we were already dealing with
that phenomena is just here.

474
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,540
It's a quite,
seems quite defiant and bold it oh,

475
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:08,374
bloody hell.
And it's literally the Russians as well 

476
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,160
as this sort of hyper aggressive,
I mean,

477
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,273
I think it's funny,
isn't it over the last year that the 

478
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,590
Democrats had been in disarray,
and let's face it,

479
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:20,410
British politics hasn't been in great 
shape.

480
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:22,030
And the funny thing is it's been sort 
of,

481
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,940
I dunno,
it's been people in civic society,

482
00:22:24,941 --> 00:22:25,990
it's been activists.
It's,

483
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,843
it's been,
it's been infested with Janice like 

484
00:22:28,841 --> 00:22:31,840
myself who've almost be kind of filling,
filling the gap.

485
00:22:31,841 --> 00:22:35,020
And I sort of make,
make kind of two quick please.

486
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,150
One is,
I think we need,

487
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,920
I think in our trouble,
confusing times.

488
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:41,650
We need good method.
We need to be evidential.

489
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,330
We need to kind of admit when we're 
wrong,

490
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,293
the facts might change.
And we need to kind of be humble in the 

491
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:49,150
face of some very kind of complicated 
stuff.

492
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,300
Uh,
and the other thing I would say is so an

493
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:56,590
urge people to kind of buy newspapers if
you don't have the Guardian by something

494
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:59,080
else or just contribute to news because 
we need,

495
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,230
we need people doing this stuff,
I think more than ever.

496
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,770
But it feels to me that these categories
are being challenged.

497
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:08,680
The idea,
even of a nation state,

498
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:12,790
I think people are starting to feel this
doesn't work for me any more.

499
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,600
They're the,
the,

500
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,870
the United States of America doesn't 
represent my interests.

501
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,640
It's kind of a veil that's placed 
between me and power.

502
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,170
And now like,
so for me,

503
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:24,004
that the trump becomes a sort of gross,
a grotesque example of what's proceeded 

504
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:28,864
in Tfa.
Like this is something I've been 

505
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:31,840
mentioned in ever since I heard it in,
in this room.

506
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:34,840
As a matter of fact,
the academic Kai Hindi,

507
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,913
Andrew's this sociologist said,
Donald Trump is a better president for 

508
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:41,104
African Americans and Barack Obama 
because under Donald Trump we are 

509
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:46,040
confronted with the truth of what 
politics

510
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,290
actually is,
what race in America actually is,

511
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,250
rather than dealing with the temporal 
distraction.

512
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:54,500
That was,
that was Barack Obama and out like,

513
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:55,334
you know,
I'm in no position either racially or 

514
00:23:56,691 --> 00:23:57,524
academically to make such an assertion,
but something about that resonated very 

515
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:02,114
deeply with me and it seems like that 
while we sort of get all anxious about 

516
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:06,764
this,
of which agencies are involved in 

517
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:10,640
organizing news empower,
the key issue is,

518
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,280
are ordinary people being given access 
to power?

519
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,620
Are they able to control their lives?
No.

520
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,560
Were they able to prior to Donald Trump?
No.

521
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,000
Is Donald Trump sort of worse than a bit
nasty seeming,

522
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,850
madly sexist and in some instances 
vulgar and grotesque,

523
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,693
almost beyond imagination quite clearly.
But what concerns me is this sort of 

524
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:38,880
attempt to sort of scramble backwards to
look,

525
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:39,714
just can we get back to where we were 
eight years ago when it was at least 

526
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,320
nice seeming people that were doing 
stuff less vividly.

527
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,010
But that,
but that's not my thesis.

528
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,913
Um,
brilliant thesis on the involvement of 

529
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:52,650
Russia.
But like I said,

530
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,593
but what concerns me is that how this 
will be used by neo liberal politicians 

531
00:24:57,191 --> 00:24:58,024
in the United States of America to sort 
of try and reinstate what proceeded 

532
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,830
trump when the lesson that really needs 
to be learned.

533
00:25:02,831 --> 00:25:05,890
It's politics needs to radically shift 
the way that power is organized,

534
00:25:05,891 --> 00:25:07,560
needs to radically shift.
And like,

535
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,320
it's not like,
you know,

536
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,930
this just Asher,
Tony Blair back in or Bill Clinton.

537
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,950
That's not the answer.
Um,

538
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,670
I think I did this disagree with you,
but,

539
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,840
but I,
I sort of think,

540
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,353
um,
one thing we need is we need good 

541
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:22,540
storytelling actually.
Um,

542
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,320
we were talking about shifting power 
back to the people.

543
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:27,810
We need to tell good stories.
We need to engage people in,

544
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,550
in this stuff because obviously it 
fascinates you and it fascinates me.

545
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:34,080
But it leaves some people kind of cold.
And I,

546
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,170
I'm not sure that,
that,

547
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,310
you know,
the stories,

548
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,670
the little mini stories that Donald 
Trump tells on twitter,

549
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,553
very powerful.
They're very emotive that get food to 

550
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:42,520
millions of people.
But,

551
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,890
but um,
there are other stories as well.

552
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:48,040
And I think at the end of the day,
my job is to try and,

553
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,450
um,
in the areas I understand,

554
00:25:51,451 --> 00:25:52,284
you know,
Russia and also did lots of stuff on 

555
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:53,961
offshore,
on,

556
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:55,680
on,
I did the Panama papers,

557
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,170
the paradise papers is to,
yeah,

558
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,020
yeah,
I did Snowden,

559
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,370
I did the Wiki leaks stuff.
I've done all of these kinds of,

560
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,113
the big investigations last for years 
and I've sort of written books about 

561
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:10,200
most of them is to actually take these 
kind of quite complex themes and to tell

562
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,740
them in a,
in a really exciting and racy way,

563
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:15,120
it's nonfiction.
It's all true.

564
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:15,901
It's all,
it's all,

565
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:18,300
it's all granted,
but so people can kind of read them,

566
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:21,420
not necessarily scholars or students 
from international relations,

567
00:26:21,421 --> 00:26:23,850
but the kind of thing you can read on 
the beach or on a train.

568
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,280
Oh two things that I want to do,
like in this,

569
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,280
this next beat of the interview.
One is I want you to,

570
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,323
if you don't mind,
read us what you think is the bit that 

571
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:34,920
exemplifies what you've just said.
Then like sort of populist,

572
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:36,120
accessible,
thriller,

573
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,650
right in from this book,
collusion.

574
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,633
And now I think he's,
can you explain this story of Edward 

575
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,400
Snowden is like [inaudible] sort of,
he,

576
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,340
he roic

577
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,280
pail of our time and I,
I'd like to,

578
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:48,450
you know,
like sort of give,

579
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,060
this is precedes Donald Trump.
You know,

580
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:51,910
like this is like,
you know,

581
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:55,830
this sort of like exposure of corruption
and the way that it was handled.

582
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,640
The White Bengal,
donald snowed a that,

583
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,281
that,
sorry,

584
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:01,590
the Edward Snowden was exiled.
You know,

585
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,380
this all happens for trump's not on the 
landscape at this point.

586
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,410
This is all under Obama and this isn't 
the proceed previous administration.

587
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,360
Can you explain it?
Tell us like,

588
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,194
you know,
using your thriller and pop from the Ra 

589
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:14,560
skills.
A little more about that.

590
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,241
No,
no,

591
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:20,241
you're teasing how routine,
sorry.

592
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,080
So what do you want me to do?
Sorry Dude.

593
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:25,050
It's no to one first cause cause he 
seems to me like a hero.

594
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:26,310
I can get my chops around.
Well,

595
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,450
I mean think about snowden is that he's 
a kind of classic whistle blower and,

596
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,840
and um,
uh,

597
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,810
I mean I read a book about her man that 
I'm kind of very admiring of him.

598
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,703
Uh,
essentially what he was someone from 

599
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:39,720
inside the American intelligence 
community who realized,

600
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,593
uh,
to his kind of gradual horror that the 

601
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:44,880
United States government and the UK by 
the way,

602
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,810
and various kind of Anglo Saxon partners
where hoovering up all of our electronic

603
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:49,644
stuff,
regardless of whether we were criminals 

604
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:55,890
or old ladies or students doing gcse.
It was all being sucked up.

605
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,320
Text messages,
web searches,

606
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,950
emails and,
and then,

607
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:02,760
and then that kind of geolocation data 
you have from your iphone,

608
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:04,200
so where you've been,
et Cetera,

609
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:05,850
all of that is recorded every two 
seconds.

610
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,683
And there'd be no public debate or 
conversation or kind of reckoning as to 

611
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:11,334
whether it was appropriate.
And the volumes had gone from small in 

612
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:18,330
about 2002 massive billions,
billions a day,

613
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:20,880
30 billion plus items a day.
Uh,

614
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,440
and he,
he blew the whistle.

615
00:28:22,441 --> 00:28:24,420
He leaked the stuff to my newspaper,
The Guardian.

616
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,560
He fled to Hong Kong and he's now living
in exile in Moscow.

617
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:29,394
He kind of got stuck there basically by 
mistake and I think he's a kind of 

618
00:28:32,721 --> 00:28:33,554
heroic figure who kind of pulled across 
the curtain and showed us the real 

619
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:42,110
nature of,
of of reality in the 21st century and at

620
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:42,944
least allowed us to have a kind of 
proper conversation with power about 

621
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,790
what's appropriate and not appropriate.
Okay.

622
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,020
Wow.
That was brilliant.

623
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,771
So like,
you know,

624
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:50,604
if that's what's proceeding and trump,
how significant is the Fisher that he 

625
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:55,404
represents in,
cause it's not like he what proceeded 

626
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,090
had any values anyway.
These are these they are captured.

627
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:03,780
So like I can really understand how that
the,

628
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,890
there is an appetite for trump for a 
figure that's like,

629
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,490
you know,
these,

630
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,323
you know,
trust these people you it or drain the 

631
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:12,084
swamp.
I can see how that kind of language is 

632
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:15,690
going to be resonant when it's in the 
ether.

633
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:17,880
Anyway.
That was what proceeded him.

634
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,953
Was that an environment that required 
Edward Snowden and when it would snow 

635
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:23,640
and does do that,
it's not like this guy's a hero.

636
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,350
Bring it back.
Let's have a parade.

637
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,090
Drape him in the Stars and Stripes.
No,

638
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:31,260
the guy goes and lives where Russia now 
the feelings in this one?

639
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,600
I,
I mean it's quite,

640
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:33,434
it's quite interesting because obviously
I wrote a book that the American 

641
00:29:35,811 --> 00:29:39,170
intelligence community didn't much like,
I think there might like this one a bit,

642
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:42,880
a bit more because I won essentially 
because,

643
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,400
um,
the,

644
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,340
there are questions inside Washington.
I mean basically what I was told,

645
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,080
having taught a sources here,
here,

646
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:49,740
here,
and,

647
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,200
and in the states a lot is that,
you know,

648
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,133
there are a lot of Americans,
it's inside this intelligence 

649
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:56,740
establishment,
let's call it that.

650
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:57,910
If you like,
who,

651
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,450
um,
disagree with what the presence doing.

652
00:30:00,451 --> 00:30:01,284
I mean,
generally they tend to be kind of more 

653
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:05,400
right leaning than left.
But Obama,

654
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,440
they might not like what he was doing,
but,

655
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:09,210
but essentially they recognize his right
to do it.

656
00:30:09,211 --> 00:30:10,044
And the thing about trump,
what makes him different is that they 

657
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:16,320
are genuinely asking whether he's a 
Patriot actually,

658
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:17,154
whether he puts American values or 
however you want to call it first 

659
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:20,874
American democracy faster,
whether actually he puts his own 

660
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:26,400
personal and family interests above 
everything and what deals,

661
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,533
especially financial deals.
He might have cut with Moscow both 

662
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:30,924
recently and in the past.
And so that we're in a very curious 

663
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:34,381
place.
We,

664
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:35,214
we're in a sort of situation where we 
don't entirely know where the real 

665
00:30:38,851 --> 00:30:42,810
loyalties of Donald Trump are,
but what are these values?

666
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,370
What are the values that he's breaching 
like now,

667
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,090
because I have what I sense the energy 
that I sense that he is writing.

668
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,300
Is it kind of an emergent rage coming 
from the feeling of nihilism coming from

669
00:30:57,331 --> 00:30:59,610
hold on a minute,
this then this isn't real.

670
00:30:59,611 --> 00:31:01,480
None of it's true.
So like,

671
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,590
you know,
like so when people are kind of like,

672
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,100
oh,
this guy's an anomaly or now an outrage,

673
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,450
I feel like,
well what,

674
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,580
what are these values?
I mean,

675
00:31:11,581 --> 00:31:13,560
of course it's disgusting.
Some of the things he said about women,

676
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:15,960
some of the racist stuff,
all disgusting.

677
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:16,794
But when it comes to like,
what is this citadel that's being 

678
00:31:19,201 --> 00:31:20,034
defended?
Because it seemed like it was pretty 

679
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:22,260
disgusting.
Anyway.

680
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,263
And now I'm asking you this as a person 
that knows a lot about international 

681
00:31:26,071 --> 00:31:26,904
politics,

682
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,390
like the show,
but I mean,

683
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:28,800
I,
you know,

684
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,150
I,
I'm,

685
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,960
I'm not a politician.
I kind of described ran it,

686
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,610
but I don't know.
I mean,

687
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,070
I guess what I would say,
I mean,

688
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,490
if we can just sort of take a America 
out of it.

689
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:39,380
So it's not just kind of your eras 
facing until,

690
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,610
could it more generally?
I mean,

691
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:41,444
I,
I sort of,

692
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,630
I've spent a lot of time in my kind of 
career as a reporter for the Guardian as

693
00:31:44,631 --> 00:31:47,030
a foreign correspondent in war zones.
I mean,

694
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:47,864
I've,
I've been in pretty sketchy places in 

695
00:31:48,771 --> 00:31:53,130
Afghanistan and Libya and Iraq and,
and Ashley,

696
00:31:53,131 --> 00:31:56,160
what do you talk to ordinary people?
They don't,

697
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:56,994
I mean,
I wouldn't say that kind of neolistic 

698
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,360
that there,
but they did kind of want,

699
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,110
they want sort of decency.
They want kind of healthcare.

700
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,240
They want jobs,
they want their kids to have a future.

701
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,990
They want sort of,
uh,

702
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,240
they want governments that change.
I mean that,

703
00:32:10,241 --> 00:32:12,390
that's the kind of key thing about 
governments is that one,

704
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,890
one law,
it has to go in a lot has to come in and

705
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,490
maybe I'm set fantastically old 
fashioned fuel for your program.

706
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:19,324
But I actually do believe in,
in kind of brilliant basic human rights 

707
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:25,930
and universal values were supply 
everywhere,

708
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:27,610
whether it's America,
Russia,

709
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,940
central London or ever.
And I think we've slightly lost track of

710
00:32:32,941 --> 00:32:33,271
that.
I,

711
00:32:33,271 --> 00:32:34,104
and I actually think,
I see that these places you were a 

712
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:38,220
foreigner or Afghanistan,
Iraq,

713
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,113
Libya,
all countries chewed up by this thing 

714
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:43,610
that we're trying to preserve and 
cherish.

715
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,121
And there,
no,

716
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:46,550
I mean we're not trying to cheer up 
interventionism I mean,

717
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:47,384
we're not trying to kind of defend kind 
of these kind of grandiose misconceived 

718
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:53,890
imperialistic projects.
I,

719
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,850
I'm,
I'm starting from a position of,

720
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:56,660
you know,
if you,

721
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,260
if you're a war reporter,
actually it's a very easy thing to do.

722
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,093
It's much more easy to report on war 
than is to report on Brexit because you 

723
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:06,140
just talk to ordinary people.
You ask them stories,

724
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:08,720
you'd ask them about their lives,
their kids,

725
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:09,770
why they fled.
You know,

726
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:11,630
what they saw,
who they met,

727
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:14,660
he pointed a gun at them and he tell 
those stories as well.

728
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:17,000
My point about storytelling,
I just think it's really important,

729
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:17,834
it's kind of elemental that we tell the 
right stories that we tell kind of pro 

730
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:23,510
human stories,
but that,

731
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,373
that we,
we try and seek the truth rather than a 

732
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:29,690
truth and also that we don't totally 
lose faith in,

733
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,093
in humanity and kind of succumb to the 
Neil Ism that you were talking about 

734
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:37,130
earlier on and we must never do that.
We must never do that.

735
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,820
When you're in your work as a war 
correspondent,

736
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:41,654
it becomes clearly human cause it's an 
identifiable situation and you feel you 

737
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:52,340
can obviously connect with that humanity
until their stories where it was in more

738
00:33:52,341 --> 00:33:54,050
complex situations.

739
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,410
Somehow it is what it is.
Opaque.

740
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,580
Well it can be.
It can be very,

741
00:33:58,581 --> 00:33:59,990
he said,
she said that's the,

742
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:01,370
that's the bump.
It can be,

743
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,140
you know,
there's kind of,

744
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,973
there's sort of the,
you kind of have to sort of go and find 

745
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:06,680
banners and sometimes when you're doing 
that,

746
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:09,050
you actually lose sight of the truth,
which is,

747
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:09,884
for example,
one group of people are shelling of 

748
00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:13,160
bunch of civilians.
There's not really he sheds.

749
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,780
She said it's just,
he shall,

750
00:34:15,781 --> 00:34:18,670
Ye shall know that just,
you know,

751
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:19,783
that is the reality.
You have little pun there about people 

752
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:22,274
being killed by heavy artillery.
And we'll read us the best bit or not 

753
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,380
the best bit a bit of this like,
you know,

754
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,740
pop you laray and all of that.
Yeah.

755
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,030
Um,
well,

756
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,760
so this book begins with Christopher 
Steele,

757
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:37,670
who's the British spy at the heart of 
all this.

758
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,553
Uh,
and I went to see him about four weeks 

759
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,480
before his famous dossier was published 
in January by buzzfeed.

760
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,380
Um,
and I go into his office,

761
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,890
a modest ground floor suite knew this 
was the best bit straight away.

762
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:53,300
Cause this is a bit,
you do when you do readings.

763
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,190
Is it,
this is the first time anyone's asked me

764
00:34:55,191 --> 00:34:56,440
to read from this book.
So I'm actually,

765
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,090
I'm actually improvising king.
No,

766
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,240
no,
it's a bit old school reading.

767
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,910
But anyway,
um,

768
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,043
so yeah,
grandpa sweet couple of bear rooms 

769
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,310
painted.
I rewire to kind of map of the wwe world

770
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:08,144
fixed to one wall.
This is Christopher Steele's office 

771
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,593
lined up near the director's desk.
He's the director of this business 

772
00:35:13,851 --> 00:35:14,684
intelligence,
um,

773
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,710
uh,
from a nesting Russ Russian dolls called

774
00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:21,530
Matryoshka,
a souvenir from Moscow.

775
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,860
They feature Russia's great 19th century
writers,

776
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:26,240
Tolstoy,
Gogol,

777
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:27,440
Lermontov,
Pushkin.

778
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,330
Um,
and I say,

779
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,340
and the tumultuous days of 2016,
the dolls were as good as a ma,

780
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,283
as good as any metaphor for the 
astonishing secret investigation had 

781
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:38,760
recently been asked to do.

782
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,860
It was an explosive assignment to 
uncover the Kremlin's inner most secrets

783
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:48,000
with relation to one Donald J.
Trump to undress them one by one.

784
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,103
Like so many dolls until the truth was 
finally revealed and it had Russian 

785
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:56,634
belts in it.
I'm absent some figures from Russian 

786
00:35:58,261 --> 00:35:59,094
literature.
I thinking I've wanted to know what was 

787
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:03,240
going to happen next.
Read the book,

788
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,570
take it to ridiculous extremes.
Entry could be going on me,

789
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,340
snatch me out of my life.
Bury me in language.

790
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,121
No,
no,

791
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:16,590
no.
I will read your book.

792
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,900
I'll read it when bloody hell might come
on.

793
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:20,890
You've got this number one best seller.
What'd you want?

794
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:26,270
You want everyone in the world to read?
He can't give into that kind of ego.

795
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:29,970
That's one of the things.
Your story or your lecturing me on ego.

796
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,810
What,
who,

797
00:36:31,811 --> 00:36:33,030
who is better qualified?

798
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,510
Come on this.
Getting some more stuff.

799
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:40,770
There's going to alike like a proper 
deep gear in here.

800
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,223
I mean one thing,
one thing I didn't talk about my 

801
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:44,004
experiences in Moscow,
I didn't know if you want to hear about 

802
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,990
that.
They kind of um,

803
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,563
helps shape the book and write the book 
because basically after doing all of 

804
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:54,430
this war that we talked about earlier,
um,

805
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,030
in the Middle East and elsewhere,
um,

806
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,223
I lived in Germany for awhile.
I did side trips to Baghdad and then I 

807
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:03,870
was posted with wife,
wife,

808
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:04,860
and two kids.
Well not,

809
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:07,110
not in war zones,
but kind of on forum postings.

810
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:10,980
And then we moved to Moscow.
And this was,

811
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,630
do you remember that?
This is the case of my,

812
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,190
uh,
the celebrities,

813
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,630
my previous book of very expensive 
poison.

814
00:37:15,631 --> 00:37:16,464
I don't know if you remember the case of
Alexander live in Yanco was a Russian 

815
00:37:18,331 --> 00:37:20,190
desk dissident,
famously,

816
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,680
famously poisoned umbrella.

817
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,971
No,
it wasn't a brother.

818
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:26,280
It was a radioactive cup of tea,
uh,

819
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,143
given by two criminals,
assassins in a hotel not too far away 

820
00:37:29,701 --> 00:37:30,620
from here.
Um,

821
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,760
and I arrived shortly after his murder,
uh,

822
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,653
and I started investigating this story 
and it was made pretty clear to me in 

823
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:38,830
Moscow.
The,

824
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,693
my,
my inquiries were most unwelcome and I 

825
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:42,114
had strange guys wearing cheap black 
black leather jackets and brown shoes 

826
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:47,184
following,
following me around the icy streets of 

827
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:50,190
the city.
And it's scary,

828
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:50,850
mate.
Well,

829
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:51,571
hang on.
I mean that,

830
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:52,404
that was,
that was the funny bit because that was 

831
00:37:53,191 --> 00:37:54,990
more kind of clue.
So then kgb,

832
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:56,010
I mean that was,
that was,

833
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,710
um,
uh,

834
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,603
that,
that was kind of okay because they will 

835
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:02,210
come and sit next to you in a cafe and 
why it was clear that,

836
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,280
not like that you wouldn't lie that 
well.

837
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,173
Okay.
So there was that and there was sort of 

838
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:11,910
electronic surveillance as well.
So whenever I made it kind of phone call

839
00:38:11,911 --> 00:38:12,744
or told a joke about Pooja and there 
would be a kind of ominous on the phone 

840
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:17,154
with a line cut.
So then you redialed you make another 

841
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:24,780
joke about Putin.
And so it was all very demonstrative.

842
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,540
The idea was to sort of show that,
that they were on your case,

843
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:29,280
that they were listening.
Um,

844
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,630
and,
and the thing that really,

845
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:34,410
um,
kind of disturbed us because I was,

846
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,363
cause I said by kids were at that point 
our kids were six and nine was we had a 

847
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:42,340
series of breakins at our apartment 
where we live in Moscow.

848
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,320
And it was done in a kind of most 
obvious way.

849
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:50,380
This is from the kind of KGB manual to 
show that they've been there.

850
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:51,700
And one of the things they did,
for example,

851
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:52,534
was when we were living on the sort of 
50th floor of an apartment block in 

852
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:57,214
Moscow,
that they busted open the the window 

853
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,813
next to my six year old son's Ikea bed 
with a sort of 20 meter drop to the 

854
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:04,540
courtyard below.

855
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,370
So that was kind of broken and left 
open.

856
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:07,204
In other words,
implying that he might just meet with a 

857
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:10,534
little accident and there was a lot of 
very crude stuff like that family fate 

858
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:14,640
is deleted.
Um,

859
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,730
and,
um,

860
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:16,481
uh,
we,

861
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:17,314
we sort of sought advice from the 
British embassy in Moscow and they 

862
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:20,110
basically said,
you are bugged.

863
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,311
And I said,
well,

864
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:21,910
look,
is there,

865
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,980
is there anything you can,
you might do about this?

866
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:25,360
Can you get rid of the bugs?
And they said,

867
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:26,380
well,
now we come,

868
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,940
you know,
have a cup of tea and a biscuit.

869
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,920
You just have to live with it.
So we had,

870
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:31,283
we were basically,
and we discovered there was video as 

871
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:36,640
well.
So we have three and a half years before

872
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,050
I was eventually deported from Russia 
under surveillance in the bedroom,

873
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,380
the living room everywhere.
Um,

874
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,273
and,
and the reason it's relevant is that 

875
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:47,344
when you,
when you sort of try and think about 

876
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:52,210
would Putin of tapes,
Donald Trump in Moscow in 2013,

877
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,530
you,
Betty Wood,

878
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,580
this is what they do.

879
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,413
This is what they did to me.
If they have a whole technical 

880
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:57,844
department that does this stuff,
they're quite fixated on sexual 

881
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,900
behavior.
Uh,

882
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,793
on one occasion they left a sex manual 
bile bed when we'd been away on holiday 

883
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:07,340
and Berlin and we came out to discover 
this,

884
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:09,760
this book in Russian,
uh,

885
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,860
lying there.
And I sort of picked it up and I thought

886
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:15,910
this is the most strange moment of mine.
I've what message of the KGB 20%.

887
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,860
Well,
you're not a bit frightened mate.

888
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,350
Well,
eight went out that window bit.

889
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,700
I mean,
yeah.

890
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:22,534
I mean the thing is that what they've 
very good at is they're sort of try and 

891
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:27,850
find your point of vulnerability.
So for most people is their kids there,

892
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:28,684
you know,
the idea that something might happen to 

893
00:40:29,021 --> 00:40:30,080
your children.
It is,

894
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:31,900
it's kind of really a sort of primal 
thing.

895
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,733
And in my,
I think the goal was basically to make 

896
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:34,714
me stop writing articles that they 
didn't like and probably to decide with 

897
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:40,630
my wife that it was time to pack our 
bags and leave Moscow.

898
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,850
Well because,
well,

899
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:44,800
first of all,
because my wife's brother cool and,

900
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,703
and independent and kind of feisty and 
she had her own life and she was 

901
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:49,504
enjoying it.
I lucky in Russia you'd have to part 

902
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:53,620
with a sex manuals when it wasn't,
I mean,

903
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:56,290
it wasn't open windows.
I wasn't quite as crudely phrase,

904
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:57,071
but,
but yeah,

905
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:58,090
I mean you're,
you're right.

906
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,550
Um,
but also I was kind of furious.

907
00:41:00,551 --> 00:41:01,271
I mean,
I sort of thought,

908
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:02,104
well that's what they want me to do.
And so actually it didn't stop my 

909
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:07,030
reporting in fact rather so sharpened 
it.

910
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,240
But what it did do was to include it in 
the reporting.

911
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,150
I could am I in the book I read off,
I got kicked out,

912
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:14,520
which was called Mafia state,
which,

913
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:16,300
which I read from London.

914
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,110
I'd been bender,
been expelled from that point,

915
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,100
but at that point,
but what it did do was give me a kind of

916
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:21,934
insight into,
into the thuggish newness to sort of 

917
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,070
crude nature of the KGB.
I mean,

918
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:27,904
they're very keen to sort of show that 
there are master that they kind of 

919
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:32,550
control the situation.
Um,

920
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,120
they don't subtle.
Um,

921
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,043
and they,
they kind of target people messed at 

922
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:39,630
random.
And,

923
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,860
and the,
the contacts I made there that the way I

924
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:43,694
saw how kind of the Russian intelligence
kind of know matrix works really helped 

925
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:50,150
with this book on,
on Donald Trump.

926
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,140
Not,
not because,

927
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,013
you know,
trump trump what he had slightly 

928
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:56,240
different experiences,
but I kind of,

929
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,120
I understand they're kind of dark 
wellview actually.

930
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,220
Um,
and we survived it.

931
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,510
Congratulations.
And it's bloody terrifying now.

932
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:05,344
So like sort of an aspect of Russian,
the Russian political strife that was 

933
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:12,530
presumably to some degree subordinate,
the KGB,

934
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:17,230
you're saying it's now been elevated to 
supreme potency in the figure of poo in.

935
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,073
So we should expect those tactics.
They're sort of take place it on the 

936
00:42:20,681 --> 00:42:24,380
national stage in the way they may have 
only done covertly or domestically.

937
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,870
I mean essentially preaching for 
[inaudible].

938
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,713
It's Cold War.
He's doing it again this time he's 

939
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,070
determined to,
to sort of win.

940
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,080
Um,
he,

941
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:32,923
he,
he,

942
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,270
he sees Russia and opposition to the 
United States.

943
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,820
There's even a Russian word for it,
which KGB,

944
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:41,660
it's a in all the KGB manuals,
it's called love me proteomic love.

945
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,553
And they put ethnic,
which wins the main adversary gladney 

946
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,850
procurement.
That,

947
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:47,703
that's,
that's really how Putin views views the 

948
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:50,624
u s and we use the UK as a kind of 
little sidekick of the glove and the 

949
00:42:52,621 --> 00:42:54,210
protein ethnic.
Um,

950
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:55,663
and um,
he's doing a pretty good job of 

951
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,790
prevailing,
I mean,

952
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,230
when a Cold War,
I mean,

953
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,301
well,
you,

954
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:03,360
you don't necessarily win,
but what you want to do,

955
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,610
you want to do,
you want to keep,

956
00:43:04,611 --> 00:43:07,900
keep your enemy in a state of perpetual 
weakness and,

957
00:43:07,901 --> 00:43:08,840
and disarray.

958
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,960
Uh,
and they're pretty good at that.

959
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,913
That's pretty good.
That you said earlier that the sort of 

960
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,243
American secret service community 
regarding this is a sort of an 

961
00:43:18,771 --> 00:43:19,604
inconceivable master stroke.
What's occurred that there sort of a 

962
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:26,570
spirit of chaos has been unleashed in an
American?

963
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,660
I W Bruton didn't do the unleashing.
I mean the chaos was there.

964
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:30,370
He,
he,

965
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,730
he just took advantage of it basically.
And,

966
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,740
and,
and,

967
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:35,400
and it's in a way,
it's kind of quite crew,

968
00:43:35,401 --> 00:43:36,350
but it's quite effective.
I mean,

969
00:43:36,351 --> 00:43:39,350
he had gangs,
they've got this troll factory,

970
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:42,080
there's famous troll factory and some 
Pittsburgh weather up there are gangs,

971
00:43:42,081 --> 00:43:44,390
have sort of cynical students earning 
$15,000

972
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:45,224
a year who posts comments in,
in pretty good English on western 

973
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,180
websites praising Putin or,
or,

974
00:43:51,181 --> 00:43:52,014
or adopting kind of talking points.
They did it in the Guardian for years 

975
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:54,974
and years and years.

976
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,023
And during the American election,
these Russian students called Sergei 

977
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:02,450
were pretending to be text and 
housewives called Karen,

978
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,280
uh,
writing about,

979
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,510
you know,
tweeting,

980
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,030
um,
gifts of Donald Trump propping a Mexican

981
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:10,700
in the bin as saying,
Cheerio Pal,

982
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,070
you know,
stirring up passions over immigration,

983
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:15,410
pretending to be activists from black 
lives matter.

984
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,800
Uh,
and loads and loads of Canada.

985
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,400
Yeah.
Loads of other Americans were,

986
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:26,790
were gleefully re tweeting this stuff,
seeing it on their facebook pages,

987
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,400
liking it thinking I Look Karen,
you know I like,

988
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,253
I agree with Karen and Karen is really 
Sergei and say you don't need to be a 

989
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:36,564
genius,
you just need to be a kind of 

990
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:40,110
opportunist and you need a little bit of
luck.

991
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,460
So these,
I suppose that even the sort of slightly

992
00:44:43,461 --> 00:44:46,310
comedic act of like

993
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,483
sp or would you,
would that even work at the title 

994
00:44:49,091 --> 00:44:49,924
espionage and sort of subterfuge?
Subterfuge has an impact on the sort of 

995
00:44:54,551 --> 00:44:57,940
feeling of being a marrow.
It permits new permits,

996
00:44:57,941 --> 00:44:58,774
a different kind of discourse.
What I was saying that is the war for 

997
00:45:00,341 --> 00:45:02,020
the mind.
It's kind of almost sort of,

998
00:45:02,021 --> 00:45:05,110
it's shopping what's already in your 
head and it's kind of an,

999
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,760
and actually if you kind of micro 
target,

1000
00:45:06,761 --> 00:45:09,990
if you look at swing states,
you can have quite an influence.

1001
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:11,790
Now,
what's interesting is that sort of a,

1002
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,380
you know,
everyone's on facebook and facebook said

1003
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:15,500
initially know that the,
the,

1004
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,590
the,
the Russians,

1005
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,160
what Russians,
what are you talking about?

1006
00:45:19,161 --> 00:45:19,994
And then something,
he came back to Congress two months ago 

1007
00:45:21,201 --> 00:45:21,651
saying,
AH,

1008
00:45:21,651 --> 00:45:22,271
yeah,
we've,

1009
00:45:22,271 --> 00:45:25,940
we've found all of these accounts paid 
for in rubles from Moscow were,

1010
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,193
yeah,
they were actually pretending to be 

1011
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:31,630
activists are pro trump supporters,
but really they were Russian systems.

1012
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:32,923
Do you think then if the,
is that something is sort of broadly 

1013
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,560
like something has comedic is that can 
be effective in the war for mental space

1014
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,153
then what we can,
can we speculate as to what the impact 

1015
00:45:46,901 --> 00:45:49,210
is of that,
the on going,

1016
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,570
uh,
what do I want to,

1017
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:54,880
how do I want to turn this,
this sort of maintenance of the dominion

1018
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:57,790
of a sort of a capitalist consumer 
culture.

1019
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,120
How we're continually,
how our thoughts are marshaled,

1020
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:02,223
controlled,
how we continually stimulated market it 

1021
00:46:05,321 --> 00:46:06,071
at,
you know,

1022
00:46:06,071 --> 00:46:06,904
like,
so what do you think of those as 

1023
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,400
obviously an excellent and did diligence
story teller.

1024
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:14,650
You're probably one of the best people 
doing this.

1025
00:46:14,651 --> 00:46:15,484
I'm guessing.
If you look from the justice for Tamir 

1026
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,040
and your CV,
then it would snow.

1027
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,830
Then you've done in paradise papers,
you've done the collusion with Russia.

1028
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,060
What do you think?
Um,

1029
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:25,080
what do you think of?
No,

1030
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,953
see,
like these,

1031
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,490
this is an anomaly,
isn't it?

1032
00:46:27,491 --> 00:46:28,324
Like it seems to me that just different 
people are getting a little go at 

1033
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:33,270
telling the story,
but it really only using this

1034
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,280
sort of,

1035
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,830
they're using techniques that existed 
before,

1036
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,700
in a sense.
The there in a way to have aims and ends

1037
00:46:40,701 --> 00:46:43,010
that aren't that different from 
previous,

1038
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,340
I want to say administrations,
but it seems like previous movements,

1039
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,203
previous movements in American life.
So over the last 30 years of what's 

1040
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:51,374
happened to,
there's probably created this state of 

1041
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:53,684
disillusionment and disenfranchisement 
where the mind can be sharpened to a 

1042
00:46:57,171 --> 00:47:00,980
point of nationalism.
So what do you think about like that,

1043
00:47:00,981 --> 00:47:01,814
those kind of stories that are sort of 
so pervasive that they are harder to 

1044
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:07,040
identify it?
Do you think it's,

1045
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,370
starts to sound a bit too wacky and 
conspiratorial?

1046
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,373
You know,
cause I feel like that's what's the 

1047
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:15,800
reason why I'm interested in Luke is 
this [inaudible] my,

1048
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,980
again,
my intuitive sense is that the,

1049
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:20,420
the,
the,

1050
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,253
the,
the oft made connection between Brexit 

1051
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:24,554
and trump is a reasonable one in that 
you have swathes of people feeling a 

1052
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:33,730
sense of that they are lacking purchase.
They have had enough.

1053
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:39,150
And my fear and concern is that by 
diagnosing the anomaly as the problem,

1054
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,313
we prevent people from analysis 
analyzing the proceeding conditions but 

1055
00:47:47,181 --> 00:47:48,014
inevitably led towards it.
And why I'm fascinated by people point 

1056
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:52,250
it out like more

1057
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:53,263
covert,
more insidious forms of tyranny such as 

1058
00:47:56,001 --> 00:47:59,360
what proceeded trump interest me.
Do like,

1059
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,411
well,
I'm,

1060
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:01,280
I mean I,
yeah,

1061
00:48:01,281 --> 00:48:02,550
I mean I take your point,
uh,

1062
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:03,710
but I,
I do,

1063
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,930
I do think that these two things can,
can both go on.

1064
00:48:05,931 --> 00:48:07,560
I mean the,
that,

1065
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,480
the external conditions put,
we call it color that they're produced.

1066
00:48:10,481 --> 00:48:15,340
Brexit absolutely are real and they are 
primarily British.

1067
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:16,430
Um,
and,

1068
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:18,970
and we,
we can talk about them forever.

1069
00:48:18,971 --> 00:48:23,620
And there are people who are genuinely 
disillusioned and have good reason to be

1070
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:25,240
kind of fed up with the system in the 
state.

1071
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,433
All of that is true,
but at the same time it's perfectly 

1072
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,040
valid to see whether,
for example,

1073
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:33,370
Sergei and Saint Petersburg was also 
setting up an account,

1074
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,773
uh,
tweeting in favor of brexit because we 

1075
00:48:36,491 --> 00:48:37,324
know that that is the case.
There were various kind of trolls 

1076
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,553
pretending to be Brett's micro topic 
targeting leave leaning voters during 

1077
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:46,150
the run up to the election.

1078
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:46,983
And the pigeon is very delighted with 
brexit because it weakens the European 

1079
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,520
Union and it weakens the UK.
Uh,

1080
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,800
and that that's all to his advantage as 
he sees it.

1081
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:55,903
And they're also question marks about 
where the money came from behind the 

1082
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,060
leave campaign.
That,

1083
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,253
I mean,
it may all have been legitimate 

1084
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,660
donations from,
from,

1085
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,550
from noble business people,
but,

1086
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,413
but there's a lot of,
it has been routed through offshore and 

1087
00:49:08,161 --> 00:49:10,920
it's kind of terribly a pig.
So I think we can,

1088
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:14,060
we can diagnosed the social ills in our 
own country,

1089
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,630
but also be alert to the possibility of 
external manipulation,

1090
00:49:17,631 --> 00:49:21,260
whether it's from Russia or indeed from 
anywhere else because he's fascinating.

1091
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,090
Yeah,
it is fascinating.

1092
00:49:23,091 --> 00:49:23,671
And it,
it is a,

1093
00:49:23,671 --> 00:49:26,990
it is a conundrum because if we,
if we lose faith in democracy,

1094
00:49:26,991 --> 00:49:29,050
if we lose faith in,
in,

1095
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,230
in the possibility of a decent or a 
better society,

1096
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:33,700
if we lose faith in each other,
what,

1097
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:34,534
where do we go?
And the thing about Putin is that he is 

1098
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:39,100
a kind of supreme near list and he,
he,

1099
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:42,490
he likes those conditions where people 
end up believing in nothing because that

1100
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:43,324
suits his sort of agenda because it,
he can do his sovereign thing without 

1101
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,970
anyone calling him out.
So,

1102
00:49:48,971 --> 00:49:50,270
so I think we,
we,

1103
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,120
we,
we do need to be even something,

1104
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,420
but we do need to be honest,
um,

1105
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,690
uh,
about what's going on.

1106
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,751
Presumably,
you know,

1107
00:49:56,751 --> 00:49:57,584
having lived in Russia,
I exposed as a sense that I'm actually 

1108
00:50:00,381 --> 00:50:01,214
okay.
Okay.

1109
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,680
If there is going to be a geopolitical

1110
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,970
struggle,
uh,

1111
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:05,803
on the ultimate scale,
probably would prefer things to be how 

1112
00:50:09,081 --> 00:50:11,300
they are in Britain than Russia having 
lived there.

1113
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,100
Those ration Porno mags.

1114
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:14,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

1115
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:15,443
It was that,
it was actually a book on sex and 

1116
00:50:16,051 --> 00:50:19,470
relationships,
but they had quite leave it.

1117
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,260
They deliver.
It was bookmarked help limb outage while

1118
00:50:22,261 --> 00:50:25,260
they hit it was bookmark to a page on 
orgasms.

1119
00:50:25,261 --> 00:50:28,040
So I think they were trying to tell me 
I'm a while it was

1120
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,993
supposed to be both and I think I didn't
know whether they were making a comment 

1121
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:36,020
about frequency or technique or all kind
of inconsistency.

1122
00:50:36,021 --> 00:50:36,950
Oh,
I'm not sure.

1123
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,690
But basically they were saying,
you know,

1124
00:50:38,691 --> 00:50:40,850
we are watching you if they're well 
intended,

1125
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:45,851
what if we re reposition Putin is a well
intending sort of avuncular figure there

1126
00:50:47,201 --> 00:50:49,500
simply to try to help you if your sex,
life and American,

1127
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,463
you know what I think,
I think you should get him on your show 

1128
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,110
and you can talk to him and then you can
decide.

1129
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:55,283
I can't imagine.
But what I certainly agree with you on 

1130
00:50:57,501 --> 00:50:58,334
luke is that we cannot afford to become 
disenchanted with the potential for 

1131
00:51:02,001 --> 00:51:02,834
democracy to be effective at.
Because I think that in my own 

1132
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:09,794
diagnosis,
which I will happily admit is from 

1133
00:51:12,951 --> 00:51:17,600
limited resources.
It feels to me that this despair is what

1134
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:22,601
has contributed to these dis junks to 
these sort of sort of horrifying moments

1135
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:27,230
if it culturally whatever side of those 
divides you stand on.

1136
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:28,303
Even when I,
people of marching in Charlottesville 

1137
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:31,723
when it's sort of outburst of rage and 
low thing and sort of targeted at 

1138
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:38,680
minority is the,
you know,

1139
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,440
I,
I feel,

1140
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,760
I feel afraid.
Yeah.

1141
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,160
From what I sense is that the solution 
he is to have an effective democracy and

1142
00:51:50,231 --> 00:51:52,600
my worry about something that's such a,
uh,

1143
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,453
an evident operation,
aberration operation such as trump such 

1144
00:51:57,131 --> 00:51:59,110
as brexit,
is that people

1145
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:00,583
won't

1146
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:01,923
look at what proceeded it.
Cause I feel that that's the platform 

1147
00:52:04,331 --> 00:52:06,040
upon which these things rest

1148
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,030
for sure.
And I think you're right,

1149
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,430
but I think we have to kind of keep 
calm.

1150
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:11,264
I mean,
but without being too kind of platitude 

1151
00:52:12,621 --> 00:52:14,390
in this week,
we have to kind of love each other,

1152
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:16,770
but we do have to kind of interrogate 
reality and,

1153
00:52:16,771 --> 00:52:19,160
and try and make sense of it and tell 
good stories.

1154
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,250
Yes,
I think you're right.

1155
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:21,084
And you're certainly doing that.
Thank you very much for the brilliant 

1156
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,264
work that you've done as a journalist 
and as a writer and bringing stories 

1157
00:52:27,151 --> 00:52:32,151
that are complex and difficult to 
understand to a wider audience that it's

1158
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,520
great work that we're doing.
And he's obviously taken a great deal of

1159
00:52:35,521 --> 00:52:36,354
bravery,
particularly what you've undertaken in 

1160
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,210
war conditions and under kind of level 
of scrutiny in Russia.

1161
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,370
I don't think I'd enjoy that really 
freak out.

1162
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,280
But just to say

1163
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,370
the really brave people in the story are
there not,

1164
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,223
not,
not people like me with a foreign 

1165
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,400
passport that the Russians or other 
people in,

1166
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:52,234
in,
in states where human rights are not so 

1167
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:56,380
great because they pay a bigger price.
Very often they,

1168
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,333
they take take risks.
Some of the people I knew of 

1169
00:52:58,571 --> 00:52:59,404
journalists,
politicians have since been kind of 

1170
00:53:00,941 --> 00:53:02,410
murdered.
No,

1171
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:03,680
I'm not.
So,

1172
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,310
so I,
I sort of think we should sort of solute

1173
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,960
people inside those countries who are 
trying to

1174
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:09,343
pastry to kind of change things for the 
better because they're tremendously 

1175
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,250
pray.
Thank you very much.

1176
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,680
Yeah,
that's a beautiful thought to end on.

1177
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:16,910
Thank you,
Luke.

1178
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,670
Thank you.
I really enjoyed,

1179
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,760
it was good chat,
isn't it?

1180
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:20,594
That we had,
it was great surprise that you've not 

1181
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:24,410
been asked to read before.
Why is that not happening?

1182
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:26,280
I think that went out about 20th

1183
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:30,510
no much understand.
She's a nostalgic medium.

1184
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:32,310
It's a long form interview.
I love it.

1185
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,830
I absolutely love it.
Thank you so much for your time,

1186
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:35,664
man.
Thanks.
