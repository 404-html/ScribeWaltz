1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,810
I was fascinated by how particular,
it becomes like juror number free.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,970
She didn't like us by that kind of 
thing.

3
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:08,370
How particular it becomes and that we've
got a sway that person,

4
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:09,930
she will be swayed by x,
Y,

5
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:12,600
zed.
And it becomes very sort of bespoke,

6
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:13,160
doesn't it?

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,210
Well,
um,

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
you know,
as when we're picking jurors,

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,430
uh,
the way,

10
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:22,290
at least I view him,
is there a certain jurors who I consider

11
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,660
to be fillers

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,210
just go with the flow.
Exactly.

13
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:27,320
They're not going to affect

14
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,460
the jury deliberation a one way or the 
other.

15
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,910
Um,
so I don't worry terribly much about the

16
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:34,520
fillers.

17
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,950
Well,
how do you identify a Filler,

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,880
uh,
by talking to them?

19
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,711
Uh,
and,

20
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:41,120
and that's the key attributes of a 
filler.

21
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,280
Uh,
the key attribute of a filler is,

22
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,440
um,
uh,

23
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,050
sort of a timid personality,
uh,

24
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,990
who doesn't seem to express any views in
any sort of a strong way.

25
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,790
Um,
you know,

26
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,624
just,
just that sort of mousy person who's 

27
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:03,400
sitting in the corner and you just sort 
of know,

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,593
uh,
that,

29
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
uh,
if,

30
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:07,650
if things get rough,
they want

31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,050
void it conflict of a,
exactly.

32
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,420
Exactly.
Um,

33
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,370
you want a few of them?
Oh No,

34
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,663
I'm happy.
I'm happy to have as many of them as we 

35
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:19,560
can in 12.
I don't,

36
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:21,431
well,
no,

37
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:22,870
no,
because you need at least one leader.

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,450
Yeah.
You need to leave now with the lead.

39
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,870
And that's what you're thinking,
right?

40
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:26,704
This guys,
I myself from a bisexual continually 

41
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,100
being accused of pushing people down the
stairs I've had just about enough of,

42
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,660
exactly,
exactly.

43
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,660
And,
and generally

44
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,551
we're going to,
you know,

45
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:41,080
you're going to focus in on and there's 
going to be three or four people,

46
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,690
uh,
in any group that gets selected,

47
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:46,270
have 12 that are not going to be 
fillers.

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,770
Uh,
and,

49
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,970
and they're going to have various 
degrees of,

50
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:51,190
of leadership qualities.
And,

51
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:52,024
you know,
this is all sort of armchair psychology 

52
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,970
as well.
Although,

53
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,863
you know,
he's strictly enough now with social 

54
00:01:58,691 --> 00:01:59,530
media,
uh,

55
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,620
we get to,
you know,

56
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,070
if you,
if you have the resources,

57
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:03,904
you start looking at people's social 
media and you get really interesting 

58
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:09,170
insights into their,
into their,

59
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,390
uh,
ways of thinking

60
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,630
based,
they attended that rally.

61
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,350
Exactly.
Exactly.

62
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:14,520
Yes.

63
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,180
Um,
but,

64
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,013
um,
so you'll get three or four people who 

65
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:22,380
you think these are people who can 
really affect the deliberation.

66
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,100
So there's this whole,
you know,

67
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:29,130
there's the theater of the case itself,
whether it's the famous staircase or any

68
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,800
case.
Then there's this secondary reality that

69
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:33,634
takes place,
annexed off over there where the 12 

70
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:39,910
jurors go off.
And in a sense that's,

71
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,773
you can't really can,
you can influence but not control what 

72
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:44,800
takes place there.

73
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,920
So then here's a good example.
No.

74
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,640
So in,
in the Peterson case,

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,190
where was one juror in particular?
Uh,

76
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,990
an older black man who we just got the 
sense all the way through,

77
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,270
was really skeptical of the and their 
theory.

78
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,660
Well,
it's just rolling his eyes.

79
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:02,530
Yeah,
exactly.

80
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
Body language,
right.

81
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,740
Um,
anyway,

82
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,820
uh,
so,

83
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,603
and it was pretty,
I think everybody in the courtroom sort 

84
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:12,520
of got the same sense.
Uh,

85
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,950
anyway,
so the jury goes out to deliberate in,

86
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:16,780
in North Carolina.
They're not sequestered.

87
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,614
They don't,
they don't have to stay in a hotel or 

88
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,050
anything.
They go home.

89
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,473
Uh,
well,

90
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,323
uh,
over that next weekend on a Saturday 

91
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,320
night,
uh,

92
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,060
apparently this juror got stopped by the
police,

93
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,523
uh,
and accused of a driving while 

94
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:34,450
intoxicated,
which he claimed he wasn't.

95
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,670
Uh,
he got arrested.

96
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,223
Uh,
and we went into court that next Monday 

97
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,883
morning and the DA stood up and move to 
excuse that juror on grounds that the 

98
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:50,090
juror had,
had,

99
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,733
uh,
been,

100
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,230
uh,
uh,

101
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,770
resistant to the police that he was 
going to be angry,

102
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:59,740
that he'd gotten arrested,
that he couldn't be fair to the state,

103
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,790
uh,
and succeeded in getting that you're,

104
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,153
uh,
knocked off the juror who took that 

105
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,070
person's place was a white female about 
the age of Kathleen,

106
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,080
uh,
who was an engineer,

107
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,170
which Kathleen also was.
Uh,

108
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,960
and we found out later and the juror 
was,

109
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,710
the jury was split at that point.
It was I think three guilty,

110
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,490
three not guilty and six undecided.
Um,

111
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,360
and then once a new jury joints,
they have to restart the node,

112
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,910
the,
the deliberations.

113
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,590
I don't know know quite how they do 
that,

114
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,720
but they're supposed to do that.
Um,

115
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,160
and that your ended up being the 
foreperson of the jury,

116
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,280
the one who came on a and she ended up 
leading the charge to convict Peterson.

117
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,900
Um,
so,

118
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,003
and for all we know,
they deliberately arrested that guy and 

119
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:54,330
the whole thing's constructed

120
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,640
that,
eh,

121
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,990
the thought crossed my mind more than 
once

122
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,050
because there's a game because it's a 
gay member as a game.

123
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,770
There's so convoluted and so much of the
process is not explicit.

124
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:09,670
So much of it is masked necessarily mask
that you're subject to influences.

125
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,070
They're very difficult to account for to
the point in fact were not only your own

126
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:14,904
attitude to truth,
which seems very sort of actually quite 

127
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:18,210
gnostic and beautiful.
Like I,

128
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,630
it's not my job to ascertain truth.
It's my job to serve,

129
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:23,730
which sounds like kind of a spiritual 
and beautiful idea.

130
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,780
In the end it becomes like there is no 
objectivity at all,

131
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,680
only power and how power can exert 
itself.

132
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,530
And

133
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,363
well,
that's certainly true in the criminal 

134
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:36,190
justice system.
Uh,

135
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,990
you know,
we,

136
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:42,280
we've seen that time and time again with
all these exonerations of people,

137
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,830
uh,
who spent decades in prison,

138
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,690
and then,
you know,

139
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,540
the DNA testing,
uh,

140
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,600
establishes that they weren't guilty.
Uh,

141
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:50,434
so what,
why did they spend all their time in 

142
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,410
prison?
Uh,

143
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,813
uh,
and generally it's because of the of 

144
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:02,501
power is because the police decided that
they knew better.

145
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:06,320
I knew best and that person was guilty.
Uh,

146
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,154
and then tunnel vision sort of kicks in.
So you have a combination of arrogance 

147
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:13,220
and tunnel vision,
uh,

148
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,630
and,
uh,

149
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,913
uh,
they ignore the evidence that's 

150
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:18,464
inconsistent with their own theories 
because they're arrogant and they have 

151
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,350
tunnel vision,
uh,

152
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,203
and they inflate the importance of the 
evidence that is consistent with their 

153
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,860
predispositions.
Oh,

154
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,240
it's called confirmation bias.
We all suffer from it.

155
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,380
It's just particularly pernicious in the
criminal justice system

156
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,623
in a sense.
Power kind of admit to its fallibility 

157
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,740
extensively without undermining its 
foundations.

158
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,640
Exactly.

159
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,773
if,
uh,

160
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,800
if,
if the authority is not infallible,

161
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,020
then it loses its authority and then 
we'll just choose some other,

162
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:55,270
okay.

163
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,200
[inaudible] right.
This is infallible and

164
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,173
yes.
