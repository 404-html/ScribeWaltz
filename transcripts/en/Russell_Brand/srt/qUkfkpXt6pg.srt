1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,650
My mind is an award winning Canadian 
writer and comedian who's performed sent

2
00:00:03,651 --> 00:00:04,484
out seasons in Australia and Britain,
London nominated for best show at this 

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,850
year's Edinburgh Festival.
Her current show,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,310
Dope,
examines a lifetime of obsessions,

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,810
fandom,
and addiction.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,980
She has appeared on BBC two live from 
the BBC and comedy central,

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,170
and recently presented her critically 
acclaimed series,

8
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:22,200
may Martin's guide to the 21st century 
sexuality.

9
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:23,034
They wouldn't be an article before that 
may mountains guide to 21st century 

10
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:28,810
sexuality on BBC Radio Four.
May.

11
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:29,644
Martin,
thank you for joining me on under the 

12
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:32,640
skin.
Thanks for having me.

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,570
I'm a fan of.
You seem like a pretty advanced person.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,500
Thank you very much.
Thanks.

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,340
You're an addict like me in recovery for
ages now.

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,800
I'm maybe 10 years.
Yeah.

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,870
How did you know that you,
uh,

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,680
had a problem with substances and that 
you needed to change?

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,750
It was all kind of.

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,010
My teens were kind of explosive and I 
started doing comedy really young.

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,070
I think you did.
It didn't,

22
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,740
you know,
as young as you like.

23
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,870
11 warning has.
Well,

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,943
when I was 11,
a comedian like got me up on stage and 

25
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:11,340
made me be his ventriloquist dummy so I 
wouldn't count that.

26
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:12,174
But when I was stand,
even though seeing that pioneering 

27
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:16,800
experience,
yeah,

28
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:17,371
he,
he,

29
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:19,380
uh,
I was in the front row,

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,333
I always loved comedy and then he got me
up and he said I'll squeeze the back of 

31
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:25,260
your neck and you open your mouth and 
I'll make you say stuff.

32
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,123
But he thought I was a little boy 
because I was in like a three piece 

33
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:29,634
suit.
And so he's making me say like filthy 

34
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,480
stuff.
And Anyway,

35
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,990
it was fun and got lots of laughs and 
then got obsessed with it.

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,950
Um,
yeah.

37
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,783
So then in my teens I started doing 
drugs and I got kicked out of my house 

38
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:45,910
and ended up,
my parents were,

39
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,300
well they read my diaries.
Actually I'd,

40
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,413
I mean rookie mistake had been keeping 
these like meticulous diaries and they 

41
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:56,040
found out all this stuff I've been 
doing.

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,520
And then I guess their reaction was some
level of anger and they were doing tough

43
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:05,370
love.
So they said he can't live here anymore.

44
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,390
And then I think that was a 16.
I was very,

45
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:10,440
very young.
Yeah.

46
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,490
That's in Toronto.
Is it?

47
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,690
I suppose that's the age when I first 
moved out when I was 16 or so.

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,270
Kind of in pursuit of addiction.
Yeah.

49
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,850
What made me leave except the addiction 
itself.

50
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,743
Thinking about it now,
the reason that you're a fascinating 

51
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:23,941
guest,
of course,

52
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:24,774
your within the field of comedy,
you highly respected and you're doing 

53
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:28,644
brilliantly.
But also I suppose topically you're 

54
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:33,240
doing stuff that's kind of defining of 
our time.

55
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:37,800
You'll show before your last ones about 
gender and gender identity.

56
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:38,634
You most recent shows about addiction in
a sense like in anglophone and can 

57
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:46,870
possibly non anglophone countries.
These are determining ideas like whereas

58
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,890
people look to understand evolving and 
dissolving forms of categorization.

59
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:55,440
We look for different ways to understand
ourselves.

60
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,274
Can you talk us through whether or not 
that question is clever that I've just 

61
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,810
or observation.
It wasn't really a question,

62
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:01,990
was it?

63
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,720
It's very clever,
very flattering.

64
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,710
Um,
but yeah,

65
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:06,544
I think uh,
when you hear the word spectrum a lot 

66
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:13,420
and I think,
well with addiction anyway,

67
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:14,254
I think if you've had a problem with 
drugs and then you've acknowledged I'm 

68
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,064
an addict,
it can be quite isolating and you feel 

69
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:20,434
like you're part of this kind of small 
subsection of the world who just can't 

70
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,400
handle their shit.
And then it's been,

71
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,493
I mean this is a really recent thing for
me just reading about it and learning 

72
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:35,851
about like the biochemistry of it and 
recognizing addictive behavior in other.

73
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,570
All this stuff you've been talking 
about,

74
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,720
but I think you're further along with 
it.

75
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:42,640
The man still like my mind is blown and 
suddenly you're like,

76
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,260
oh,
it's a spectrum of behavior.

77
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:47,110
And I think it's the same thing with 
sexuality.

78
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:49,420
You can think on this weird,
you know,

79
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,613
queer person and then you think,
well everybody has a sexuality and it's 

80
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:53,974
a spectrum.

81
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,640
Yes,
it's extraordinary actually.

82
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:59,150
It's something I've only been learning 
about because I'm probably substantially

83
00:03:59,151 --> 00:03:59,984
older than you and I'm probably educated
in different way had difference of 

84
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:03,114
cultural references.
When I see something like 40 percent of 

85
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:05,384
people under 25 don't identify with a 
sort of a homogenous sexual group in a 

86
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,630
more interested in fluid of a,
you know,

87
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,210
even though I think of myself as sort of
a countercultural person,

88
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:15,044
I'm sort of.
Oh,

89
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,970
I know me too though.

90
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,880
I mean I'm 30,
I think of myself as pretty like cool,

91
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,743
but then I do gigs at universities and 
like freshers wigs and there I don't 

92
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:27,244
know the right terminology and I'm 
putting my foot in my mouth and they're 

93
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,394
so tuned into it.
They've got all gender neutral toilets 

94
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:36,850
and they're all have crazy terms for 
themselves and it's awesome.

95
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,510
That's great.

96
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,380
In a way it sort of makes sense,
I suppose at what you know,

97
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,290
someone of my age and older.
Is there a very clear identity?

98
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,940
Roles are very clear.
Social Roles and I,

99
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:47,774
I've been questioning a lot lately what,
how I would identify it and how I've 

100
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,253
grown up if the conversation had been 
more advanced in my own adolescence 

101
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:57,154
because you know,
what the main feeling I had growing up 

102
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,890
in a normal,
ordinary Essex home,

103
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:05,860
suburban home was not like the other 
boys,

104
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,410
but turns out that the other boys 
weren't like the other boys.

105
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,970
It's just that we're all magnetized to 
an imaginary category.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,590
And whilst there is,
you know,

107
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,453
I don't know,
Canada is one of the most sort of for 

108
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:17,044
most places in there seems like there is
a biochemical basis for at least some 

109
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,930
sort of biological and anatomical 
aspects of gender.

110
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:23,890
Uh,
but,

111
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,650
but beyond that,
the way people identify,

112
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,513
demonstrate and represent their 
sexuality seems like something that we 

113
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:34,240
need to examine a look more closely.
What was your observations on that?

114
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,500
I think it's so

115
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,830
interesting.
I think all the way we're talking about,

116
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:39,664
it's all still in its infancy.
I think in 25 years it'll be so 

117
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:45,580
different,
but it's so hard to sort of disentangle,

118
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,673
um,
cultural influences and stuff in terms 

119
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,790
of gender roles.
And what's normal for men and women,

120
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,680
and you're right,
there is a biological thing,

121
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:57,070
but this also I'm in,
it's so hard.

122
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,340
Undo those early influences about what,
you know,

123
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,120
masculinity and femininity.
So yeah,

124
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,073
that's interesting.
I think if we can disentangle those 

125
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,580
people be a lot less stressed,
I think

126
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,853
we're both sort of androgynous looking 
people within our sort of basic gender 

127
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,840
group.
You're quite a beautiful man.

128
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:15,420
Yeah.
I've been told I'm a handsome woman.

129
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:16,880
I get that a lot.
Yeah,

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,040
you're beautiful.
Like when I've been doing this,

131
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,640
when I've been doing this book,
stuff like,

132
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:23,474
you know,
when young people are coming to like 

133
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,213
sort of signings into my show,
I've been having sort of conversations 

134
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:33,150
that have really opened my mind up.
I was speaking to a young person and God

135
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:35,220
now we're gonna have to say they said,
you know,

136
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,103
identify as binary.
I don't identify with any particular 

137
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:39,344
gender.
And I really felt myself on the 

138
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:40,794
precipice of my own understanding,
my own linguistic abilities or my own 

139
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,070
prejudices.
I.

140
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,560
What do you think is going to be the key
component here?

141
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:50,394
Because one of the things that I've 
noticed around identity politics is 

142
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:56,820
people that are sort of our traditional 
or conservative often feel,

143
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:57,654
I think a lot of shame and a lot of 
confusion and it can become quite 

144
00:06:59,821 --> 00:07:01,810
opposition or quite quickly.
Totally.

145
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,130
Um,
yeah,

146
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:04,964
I think it's easy to experience like a 
real sense of vertigo about it because 

147
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,560
it's just happened so exponentially 
quickly and,

148
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,750
and there's all these new words and it 
feels like I don't,

149
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,800
I don't know how you are at math and 
stuff,

150
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:18,080
but I,
I used to get this panic and math class,

151
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:21,890
like when they would introduce things 
like Algebra and I and I'd be like,

152
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:22,724
it just doesn't,
it's too much information and you just 

153
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,020
dropped out of school pretty much 
because I was like.

154
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,543
And I think people have that feeling and
I think the main thing is just asking 

155
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:33,164
questions and then there's the 
responsibility and the people who are 

156
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:36,404
using these new words to explain 
patiently and we can all just be 

157
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,800
patient,

158
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,430
you know?
How,

159
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,890
how did you look at these themes in your
standup show?

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,900
Where are you personally on these ideas?

161
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,130
Identification I am,
I had,

162
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,050
my parents were real hippies and um,
yeah,

163
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:54,960
so growing up they were always,
this is,

164
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,950
I mean I'm only just realizing and for 
moving to England,

165
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,190
like how unusual this is that when I was
a kid they would always say,

166
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,403
you know,
you'll grow up and you'll meet a man or 

167
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:04,394
a woman and it always,
they just presented it as an equal 

168
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,350
option,
but I saw who knows if that's by the.

169
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,150
I've always been bisexual,
I always dated men and women is,

170
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,320
I don't know if it's because they said 
that or maybe they were like,

171
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:17,180
well she keeps wearing suits and like

172
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,870
we should have that three piece suit.
You added onto that magician show first.

173
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,910
You were overdressed for any gender 
identity for a magic.

174
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,800
So tie and suspenders.
Yeah.

175
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:28,634
So I was lucky in that area,
so I've always been bisexual and that's 

176
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,980
been great.
But yeah,

177
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,900
what I found surprising as a new father 
have a female child grant.

178
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,923
Thank you.
It's blowing my mind like it's really 

179
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,900
vacillates between this sort of 
spiritual sense of Oh wow,

180
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,930
new consciousness as a merge glory.
Glory that she exists and kind of little

181
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,400
passed it out.
Get off me.

182
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,730
Like I said,
it really pendula experienced because no

183
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:58,620
control,
no off button,

184
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,483
extraordinary.
But I've become very sensitive in a way 

185
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:05,160
that sort of surprises me around 
identity.

186
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:10,460
Like I guess my wife is more traditional
than I am and puts like,

187
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,170
you know,
sometimes puts her in dresses and things

188
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:17,430
like that and sometimes I'm like I want 
to just the way things are practical for

189
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,990
someone that can't walk up.
Right.

190
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,690
So she should just be wearing little 
pants and stuff,

191
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,470
you know.
And,

192
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,370
and like I don't know because in a way 
you could look at this is that very sort

193
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:28,290
of conventional,
an old fashioned idea that perhaps I'm a

194
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,320
man who sort of unconsciously wanted to 
have a male child.

195
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,180
I don't feel that at all.
I don't like the,

196
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:36,990
I don't like any ornamentation of 
femininity are now because it feels like

197
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:40,620
something's been put on her that's not.
She's not choosing.

198
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,050
Yeah,
they did this experiment.

199
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,303
I was get experiments wrong,
but I think this is where they had a 

200
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,680
baby in neutral clothing in the room.
Have you heard this?

201
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:50,514
And then people would come in and play 
with the baby and sometimes they'd say 

202
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:53,784
it's a boy baby,
and then when they said it was a boy 

203
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:56,664
baby,
everyone was like bouncing it really 

204
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,730
aggressive,
not aggressive,

205
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:03,960
but really physical and always faced the
baby looking away from them.

206
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,820
And then when they said it was a little 
girl,

207
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:09,000
they all turn the baby towards them and 
just sort of cuddled in like,

208
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,920
yeah,
that's sort of.

209
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:14,940
So yes.
We're not really conscious of how I talk

210
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:15,660
to parents.

211
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,030
One of the things you hear a lot when 
you become a bad as people say,

212
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,390
oh yeah,
but you know,

213
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,293
they just do start playing with vacuum 
cleaners and if they're a boy they 

214
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,440
immediately signed up to be in the 
marines and he said,

215
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,293
no,
you were not aware of the unconscious 

216
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:33,490
cues that we have achieved and I'm doing
that thing already.

217
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,373
Have a lot when people go,
because this is a question people like 

218
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:37,074
to ask me on chat shows,
I like to go where you being such a 

219
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,163
womanizer,
how are you going to feel when you do a 

220
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,530
$6 industry?
Brings home a Russell Bronco.

221
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,380
She might not bring home a and she might
be a gay person.

222
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,330
You don't know who she's going to come 
home with.

223
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,540
Such questions worked.

224
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,393
I did that too and my friend has an a 
two year old niece and they came back 

225
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:57,054
from some baby thing where they do.
Does your daughter do this trick monkey 

226
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,920
music classes and stuff and all the 
parents are like,

227
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:08,060
they're so talented like that.
So they.

228
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,740
They bring the two year old back in.
Then I hear myself going,

229
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:11,574
I guess in this smarmy way,
like do you have a boyfriend yet to the 

230
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:16,020
to like I'm saying that.
Why am I doing that?

231
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,561
Yeah,
right.

232
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:17,394
Look at us.
We're not unaware of our own 

233
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:19,314
conditioning,
so this is some like continually within 

234
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,764
your standup comedy,
is this the kind of perspective you try 

235
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:25,554
to have as a comedian?
Tell me a little bit about your process 

236
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:28,344
of conception.
Like how did you come to the idea that 

237
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,680
you were gonna write your very 
successful show?

238
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,930
Dope.
Um,

239
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,303
I,
I guess it's like we were saying like I 

240
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:37,314
always,
I've always wanted to talk about drugs 

241
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,624
and that period and in my life,
but I guess I haven't felt like I have 

242
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:47,100
enough distance from it or perspective 
on it to do it in a way where I can keep

243
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:47,934
it really light and be in control of it.
And then I had a this breakup like two 

244
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:54,010
years ago and it just felt

245
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,380
so similar to getting off cocaine.
Like it was.

246
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,101
I was like,
oh,

247
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,390
I know this feeling.
Exactly.

248
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:01,210
And then started reading about it and 
then had this,

249
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,383
you know,
started seeing these patterns in all 

250
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:06,850
areas of my life.
So then I started improvising it onstage

251
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,500
and it was way too dark and then just 
slowly adding punchlines.

252
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,403
Is that what you do?
You do like a work in progress and it's 

253
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:14,590
like too serious

254
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,513
and then you add,
you start off your development process 

255
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:22,390
is to start with just being very,
very honest and personal uncomfortably.

256
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:25,380
So how do you feel what that stage of 
development?

257
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,823
I really enjoy it.
I don't know what that kind of 

258
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,480
masochistic sometimes isn't it?
Especially when you're like,

259
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,830
I know there's no punchline coming so 
it's quite intense,

260
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:36,664
but I liked that and then every other 
year in Edinburgh I do an improvised 

261
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,380
show where people write down questions 
and then I answer them and then it comes

262
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:45,214
out of that too because you get to know 
what people want to hear you talk about 

263
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:49,760
and yeah,
that's.

264
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,700
Yeah,
I like that idea.

265
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:52,534
I have a similar process for me,
my access point for comedy is to start 

266
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:57,934
saying things that are truthful often.
Actually one of my guiding principles 

267
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:03,700
is,
does this make me feel a bit ashamed?

268
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,940
Totally.
Your ears get hot.

269
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,423
Well,
I don't want people to know that about 

270
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:10,350
me.
That's awful.

271
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,223
And then.
But that there's something about that 

272
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:13,240
exposure.
So what,

273
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,810
if you don't mind me asking,
what kind of revelations were you making

274
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,300
about the breakup?
What kind of realizations did you have?

275
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,170
Just like,
I mean they've done,

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,833
they've compared brain scans,
haven't had like a coke addict and 

277
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,463
someone who says they're madly in love 
and it's so I just think the hormones 

278
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:34,140
and things are insane and during the 
break if I just,

279
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,160
I felt so not like myself and there's 
such a.

280
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,860
So the right thing to do to end up with 
a relapse and it just,

281
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,750
I was using all this terminology that I 
was like,

282
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:43,584
God,
this is.

283
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,790
Yeah.
And,

284
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,133
and not the healthiest relationship to 
love and how can you lose yourself so 

285
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:50,370
completely in it.
Yeah.

286
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,260
So a damaging relationship.
It wasn't the best.

287
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:56,220
Yeah,
it was great.

288
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:57,300
And in a lot of ways,
but not,

289
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,310
not the best,
but yeah.

290
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,250
Alright.
Right.

291
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,330
They were punishing components to it.
I've only recently started,

292
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,183
you know,
like something sometimes I think I'm 

293
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,560
really clever,
but then I realized,

294
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:07,380
no,
you're not clever,

295
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,213
you're like an idiot because everything 
takes much too long to realize and 

296
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,500
really sort of like,
I think like a convoluted,

297
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:17,090
complex neurological root to make the 
most basic observations.

298
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:22,110
Like for sure it's healthy and nature is
healthy,

299
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:25,170
but I'm still working on nature is 
healthy.

300
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,810
Very long thesis of examination of 
grass,

301
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,860
the color green photosynthesis into 
connectivity,

302
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:33,350
the role of oxygen.
I mean,

303
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,010
I'll look at that for ages before I 
said,

304
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:35,903
well,
why don't you just go for a walk in the 

305
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:37,820
woods you said,
so you know,

306
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,140
like it's taken me a long time to come 
to terms with that.

307
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:40,974
But I noticed that my own tendency in 
relationships without being disparaging 

308
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:47,520
about the particular individuals I was 
in relationships with was set up,

309
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,070
um,
dramatic situations,

310
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,040
producing situations.

311
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,980
And then it's so euphoric when you sued 
that anxiety.

312
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:55,814
It's this weird cycle.
You see the agenda and obviously a 

313
00:14:58,771 --> 00:14:59,604
analogist to addiction that if you 
continually find yourself at a place 

314
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,520
where I'm not good enough,
they're never going to call.

315
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,390
I'm brilliant.
I'm fantastic now to maintain this.

316
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,283
Oh No,
fucking only pretend to be someone else 

317
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:14,180
for another five years.
I believe we can have a child.

318
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,530
Exactly that.
Yeah.

319
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,210
Yeah,
and that is a little.

320
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:18,044
I mean sometimes I think that substance 
addiction is the most rational form of 

321
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,553
addiction because it's a direct route to
the good feeling instead of the other 

322
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:28,580
ones are quite convoluted.
Yeah,

323
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:29,361
you're right.
Yeah,

324
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,130
and easier to control.
I mean,

325
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,350
as long as you have sort of a reliable 
hookup,

326
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,933
access to cocaine and heroin or whatever
drug is young people take these days is 

327
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,483
can be much easier than the sort of 
giddy all for a vertiginous experience 

328
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,010
of being in love.

329
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,903
Yeah.
So that's sort of what your show is 

330
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:53,240
about is it is about how your drug 
addiction as a young person leading,

331
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:54,074
you'll be expelled from the family home.
You found those patterns repeating 

332
00:15:57,231 --> 00:15:59,910
themselves in romantic situations.
Yeah,

333
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,943
I think I always just thought I got 
addicted to drugs and then I went to 

334
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:04,244
Rehab and then I've been clean ever 
since and I never really thought about 

335
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:06,764
it with much more depth and then now I'm
thinking or I mean early on when I was 

336
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:12,950
about six,
I had mad obsession with Bette midler.

337
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,340
Like really?
I saw the world through this lens of Bet

338
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,560
Midler that just everything's in 
relation to bet midler.

339
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,560
I was so obsessed with her.
Every is in relation to pet mate.

340
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,610
Yeah.
What would bet?

341
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,740
Think about this.
What's she wearing today?

342
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,180
Like I loved her.
I mean my grades were slipping at school

343
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:30,014
because I was just sitting thinking 
about Batman and then comedy and then 

344
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:34,560
drugs and then relationships.

345
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,460
Midler was your gateway?
Yeah.

346
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,660
What was it about?
What was it beat?

347
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,720
She's Hocus pocus at that.
The one where they are,

348
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,070
right.
So you're a little kid in Canada,

349
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,190
you're in a little three piece suit.
Literally this went,

350
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,990
I think I saw it 12,
13 times in cinemas and it just,

351
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,183
I mean it must've been at a sexual.
I must've had a crush on bet midler and 

352
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:00,460
I just lost my mind.
I said,

353
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,333
she's so,
what is innovation capacity that she's 

354
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,370
Sassy,
strong woman.

355
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,930
She'd take care of us.
Wouldn't she?

356
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,570
Like,
she tells us like it.

357
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:14,260
It's going to be okay.
Exactly.

358
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:17,150
Then hold on a minute.
It's getting a bit sexual and she'd sort

359
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:20,780
of cut you down quite cruelly,
but then you know what I mean?

360
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:24,620
It would be a benefit flash and then 
beck goes,

361
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:29,770
what are you going to do with that 
little thing called me out and she goes,

362
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:31,190
oh,
there you go.

363
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,050
Oh God,
actually I'm getting into like,

364
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,520
you're looking at her lovingly.
And she's like,

365
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,230
why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

366
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,280
Oh,
come on and off for you.

367
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,783
Like,
um,

368
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,150
once I saw her accepted an award at the 
Golden Globes and she said,

369
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:47,690
how about these couple of Golden Globes 
gesturing to no breasts?

370
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,800
Yeah,
that's her style.

371
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,950
And some food went all unusual in me,
but something glitched eman.

372
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,120
I've felt a feeling feeling in my tummy.
All unusual.

373
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,163
Now,
do you think this is something 

374
00:17:58,591 --> 00:17:59,424
essential?
Because obviously bet midler isn't gay 

375
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:02,590
icon.
Yeah.

376
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,983
Odd.
Before you would have had any over or 

377
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:06,834
cultural sense of a gender or sexual 
identity that you would automatically 

378
00:18:09,901 --> 00:18:10,734
found yourself to sort of some sort of 
quintessential figure within the 

379
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,310
Pantheon.
Yeah,

380
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:18,030
you're right.
I mean maybe it was just into witches as

381
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:19,940
well though.
I any kind of design,

382
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,730
which is a bit.

383
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,530
There was another one when they were 
metal street,

384
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:25,350
one of the others or something.
Sarah Jessica Parker could have gone for

385
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:26,820
that yet.
Not into it.

386
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,950
Just because she was the most evil I 
think.

387
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,980
Um,
and her voice and.

388
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:31,681
Yeah.
No,

389
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:32,340
I don't know.
Yeah,

390
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,910
it must've been.
That happens a lot though.

391
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:38,220
I mean I was obsessed with scary spice,
so as a child and then now I'm like,

392
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:39,054
well,
she's kind of a gay icon to look at 

393
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,940
that.
So it's weird,

394
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:42,774
isn't it?
Because I think a lot about constructs 

395
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,773
cultural,
whether or not we're attaching to these 

396
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:48,714
things or if there isn't a central truth
in a way this crosses over with some of 

397
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,493
young's ideas of synchronicity that 
there is something happening on a 

398
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:58,200
psychic level that is relating to the 
objective world.

399
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,900
Whereas of course the materialist will 
tell you know,

400
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:01,734
these,
these are just over patterns that 

401
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,560
signify nothing.

402
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,910
Things are there,
material value.

403
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:10,911
But if you as a little kid into Ron,
I've somehow happened upon gay icon,

404
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,170
not in a particular content and I know 
you are.

405
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,070
Your identity is more complex than that,
but it's just interesting that,

406
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:19,380
that figure is she.
Because I've never understood.

407
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,780
It's not like Bette Midler,
she's not gay or anything.

408
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:25,230
Is it a particular person?
Yeah.

409
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,700
I think it's her,
her confidence and,

410
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,921
but yeah,
you're right,

411
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:29,960
I guess.
Um,

412
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,161
yeah.
When,

413
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:35,610
when people in huge numbers respond to 
the same thing quite emotionally,

414
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,010
then yeah.
That there must be some universal.

415
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,290
Yeah.
Youngian thing that you're responding to

416
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,780
it.
It can't be just that there's a great pr

417
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,703
team or whatever.
There must be some central resonance 

418
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:46,734
now.
Where did you graduate to a after Bet 

419
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,580
Midler,
not necessarily in terms of crushes,

420
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,580
in terms of your,
uh,

421
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,190
what would you feel like your next 
attachment and then comedy.

422
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,023
So yeah,
when I was 11 and 13 niche comedy and I 

423
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:01,584
started doing standup when I was,
I had braces and I'd be in my school 

424
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:09,441
uniform and come from school smoking 
this weird sort of circus act and um,

425
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,870
did it every night of the week.
And,

426
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,220
and that's a highlight.
Any other isn't it?

427
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,110
Very much,
but what was your APP like?

428
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,080
You say,
well,

429
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,630
you've got some props,
I'm guessing.

430
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,830
No,
I just,

431
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,993
I was,
I mean I went through so many different 

432
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,990
just imitating people based because I 
didn't know who I was.

433
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,500
I was,
I wonder phase where I was just doing,

434
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:32,090
but basically bill Hicks and then 
smoking,

435
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,973
smoking three piece suit,
a little kid like character knighted 

436
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,140
character stuff and just tried all kinds
of things.

437
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:41,790
All so terrible.
Thank God.

438
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,000
Like no one had smartphones.
Isn't it interesting?

439
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:45,834
One of the things I identify with the 
May is this idea of being a little kid 

440
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:51,274
and not feeling particularly connected 
to the place where I was and feeling a 

441
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:58,840
little bit lost and adrift and for,
for me,

442
00:20:58,841 --> 00:20:59,290
like,
you know,

443
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:04,290
when a first sort of via my cousin's 
heard the smiths and then sort of looked

444
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:06,580
into the character of Morrissey,
so I'd think,

445
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,480
oh,
okay,

446
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:08,314
this guy and let you know that they're 
someone that's beautifying outsiderness 

447
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:17,170
and vulnerability and that's,
that can be a bit of an access point.

448
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,070
And then like through Morrissey you get 
to learn about,

449
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:21,904
oh,
Morrissey's interchange deems you start 

450
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,670
getting into that type of cinema and 
Morrissey's into Oscar Wilde.

451
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,970
You start learning about Oscar Wilde and
you know,

452
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:30,130
then you get into aesthetics is 
interesting,

453
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:30,941
isn't it?
How sort of,

454
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:32,830
you know,
like as opposed as a person.

455
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:33,664
My framework for understanding reality 
is spirituality and specifically 

456
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,200
spirituality through the Lens of 
addiction.

457
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:41,770
So it's about understanding how I form 
attachments,

458
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,783
but culture does have a great potency 
and can be a way to understand yourself 

459
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:49,840
in a situation in the world.
It has great beauty in it,

460
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,630
so and like Bill Hicks again was a very 
significant figure for me because like,

461
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,510
you know,
in I suppose slightly more sophisticated

462
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:01,240
way and perhaps a more mature way,
I don't know because I was an adult when

463
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,220
I first saw Bill Hicks and thought,
Oh my God,

464
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,140
that's how you're supposed to do stand 
up comedy.

465
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,203
I've been very curious to be a tiny 
little kid and trying to appropriate 

466
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:09,844
that kind of stuff.

467
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,070
Yeah,
I guess I must have.

468
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,973
I mean it's hard to remember how I felt 
at the time and I must've felt a sense 

469
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:16,784
of otherness and then especially in high
school and probably feeling a bit gay 

470
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:21,794
and then go in and find in a comedy club
where people were not only like 

471
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:27,710
declaring what was different about them 
and weird,

472
00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:30,340
but then being applauded for it and 
yeah,

473
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:35,300
that's probably pretty mind blowing.
Is it true here?

474
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:38,150
I'm just looking at my notes that you've
turned up smoking a cigarette like quite

475
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,013
early,
like you were smoking cigarettes on 

476
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,770
stage.
I just thought comedian smoke.

477
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,320
I thought that was that scene,
like Richard Pryor and stuff.

478
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:46,250
So I,
I,

479
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:46,761
uh,
yeah,

480
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:49,160
I went on with a cigarette and people 
were just,

481
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,530
I mean there were so it was silent,
but they were,

482
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,300
it was like concerned silence because 
they were like,

483
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,610
who has allowed this to happen?
Who should we,

484
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,893
should we notify and yeah,
there's some notification so that you 

485
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:02,890
will,
it was the famous

486
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,250
second city of the second series I 
started in Chicago,

487
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,084
but it's sort of like a byword for sort 
of improvisational brilliance and sort 

488
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:11,460
of the sort of vanguard of comedy.
Right.

489
00:23:11,461 --> 00:23:13,980
So you were involved when you were 
little kid in that world.

490
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,250
We're,

491
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,260
yeah,
I started.

492
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,094
Um,
yeah,

493
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,570
I started out there for a few years and 
then,

494
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:19,404
uh,
and then eventually when drugs kind of 

495
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,333
took over and replaced comedy,
then I got banned from second city for 

496
00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:29,820
two years from.
And that was devastating because I loved

497
00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:33,600
it and idolized all those people.
And I think suddenly everyone twigs,

498
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,453
oh,
this person is too young to be so high 

499
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:39,450
all the time in this building.
So then I got banned from there.

500
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:44,540
But what we're doing,
I mean everything like mostly coke was,

501
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,010
it was the big one.

502
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,130
Yeah.
I was disposable cash from comedy to.

503
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:51,130
I think I just don't give a teenager any
money.

504
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,720
I know it's a very natural conclusion to
have reminders attended.

505
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,540
What are you going to do?
Can't do what?

506
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,200
Buy Models and factory.
And even then there's the clue.

507
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,243
So you,
you're going to find your way to 

508
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,760
substances.
If you've got cash you can pay with cash

509
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:07,460
in hand for gates much.
Yeah.

510
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:08,294
And then it's around and,
and then I guess I obviously had this 

511
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,890
predisposition because a lot of people 
to coke and never want to do it again.

512
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:16,791
That's right.
Yeah.

513
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:19,520
We have the predisposition.
Are you doing drugs with adults?

514
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,743
Yeah.
Big Time.

515
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,613
That's weird,
isn't it?

516
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,210
Yeah.
Looking back,

517
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,870
I think it's weird.
At the time it felt so natural because I

518
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:31,270
wouldn't give a child drugs not going to
come out on a limb.

519
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,330
Yeah.

520
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:37,370
But so I suppose thinking about it,
the first time I got heroin it was often

521
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,880
children,
like they really.

522
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,120
So far,
I mean I've got that now.

523
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:43,070
If they were Turkish,
I've always assumed they were Turkish,

524
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:45,860
but that's just my personal bigotry 
because they were so young,

525
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,470
dark skinned,
glads in Hackney,

526
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,420
19 myself,
but they were possibly 13.

527
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,263
They're adorable,
jared guys to skinning up with heroin 

528
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,300
and I've got some off of him.
Absolutely.

529
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,680
Terrific.
Because you might imagine,

530
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,480
and really that's of it is 
interestingly,

531
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,323
so you've,
you've had the access to the world of 

532
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:08,024
comedy now,
but you sort of blended headlong into 

533
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:11,970
the,
into diction,

534
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,850
I suppose you were dealing drugs as 
well.

535
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,050
Yeah,
I was very,

536
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,620
I think I was with these adults who were
doing drugs.

537
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:22,190
I think it was very convincing about not
being a teenager.

538
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:23,650
I mean they knew I was,
but I was.

539
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,553
I think I really did my best to put 
everyone at ease with doing drugs with 

540
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:29,450
me and,
and it's not a big deal.

541
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:30,400
And so I don't,
you know,

542
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,243
they weren't villains,
but there are definitely some 

543
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,600
inappropriate behavior for sure.
Yeah.

544
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,770
That's not judge them.
What about the,

545
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,380
uh,
the drug dealing in any good at drug den

546
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:44,381
and we're now tell me the key problems.
Just it just terrible at it,

547
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:46,664
bad at math,
but at selfcontrol I'm sort of going a 

548
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:51,644
lot of people,
a lot of money gets quite scary very 

549
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,860
quickly.
Um,

550
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,800
yeah.
Probably you broke biggie smalls.

551
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:00,140
He's golden rule.
Don't get high on your own supply.

552
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,153
Learned from biggie theaters.
I did a small amount of miserable 

553
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,500
measly,
unsuccessful drug dealing myself.

554
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,863
Yeah.
My mate mark gave me quite a lot of 

555
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:13,034
amphetamines.
He said sell that your school and you 

556
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:19,460
couldn't make some profits and this 
business model.

557
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,920
But the problem was is that I was 
friends with a couple of bigger boys and

558
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,403
like took some of those drugs and I 
couldn't keep charging them because of 

559
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:28,034
just,
it was like they was too much fear in 

560
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:29,834
the relationship and I ended up swapping
my bicycle and I took too much of them 

561
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:35,450
amphetamines and it ruined my 
performance was macbeth,

562
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:38,330
if I may say so I think I'd feel a lot 
better.

563
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,710
I would pay so much money to see you 
doing macbeth as a teen.

564
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,843
He wouldn't have liked it maybe because 
it was regarded as a failure when you 

565
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:49,284
were at drama school.
They divide up a play into all the 

566
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:51,930
various,
you know,

567
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,783
like,
because everyone's got to have a go at 

568
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:53,994
being macbeth in it.
I was just doing one bit the bit I was 

569
00:26:56,671 --> 00:26:58,800
doing this,
it's just murdered king down Kinedyne.

570
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,633
I feel familiar with the play and he 
comes out with the DAC is right or sort 

571
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:05,034
of he's just done a terrible murder and 
it feels awful about it and I shouldn't 

572
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:08,964
have done it.
But because I wasn't the type of actor 

573
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:15,000
would do any prep instead of crap.
I fought speed.

574
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,193
Right.
So I've done some speed instead of like 

575
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:20,880
learning about dockers and murders and 
stuff like that.

576
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:21,714
So I come staggering out as a kite.
We've got butter knives out of the 

577
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:25,250
canteen.
But.

578
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:28,980
So the fact that you wouldn't be able to
murder a king with those butter knives.

579
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,680
Richard.
And did you had you learned the words or

580
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:32,514
not?
Oh yeah.

581
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,150
I learned those words,
but I think what it would have been like

582
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:38,040
an amphetamine drug.
It's going to make you.

583
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,470
I think it doesn't put you in the pit of
your belly.

584
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,900
It takes you into,
puts you into the upper Chakras,

585
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,080
whereas I think doing a murder,
you'd probably be really in your guts.

586
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,790
It's very earthy thing,
isn't it?

587
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,624
To murder someone,
particularly for your ad out to do it 

588
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:52,320
with a butter knife.
You'd been plunged into those ribs.

589
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,520
You'd have.
I mean,

590
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,100
your pupils are dilated to be sweaty,
but yeah,

591
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:56,963
you're right.
I know I fought that while I was doing 

592
00:27:58,411 --> 00:27:59,244
was a good job,
but you know at the end when they tell 

593
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:03,210
you whether or not you had done a good 
job,

594
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,490
the teacher said that was not a good 
job.

595
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,353
Unanimously.
Only one lad in the year below said off 

596
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:11,490
what you were good the way you've done 
that.

597
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:13,020
It was mental.
I said,

598
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:13,854
thanks.
I'll clean mark where he was not a 

599
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:18,324
person whose opinion could be relied 
upon and it doesn't have any Kudos 

600
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:21,840
within the school system.

601
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,520
Certainly I couldn't use it to press,
you know,

602
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,860
that loud in the low year for I was 
good.

603
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:33,480
Well,
whereas when I was in year four,

604
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:37,050
I guess maybe I was eight or nine,
I did Charlie Brown and I played Charlie

605
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,380
Brown is like my crowning moment in 
school and uh,

606
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:45,420
I took it so seriously that I did this 
monologue in it and I cried real tears.

607
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:47,550
Like I really went for it and there was.
So,

608
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,300
I mean,
it's like,

609
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,910
it's a comedy.
Everyone was horrified.

610
00:28:50,911 --> 00:28:54,270
They thought something had gone wrong.
And why was it about Charlie's monologue

611
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:56,190
that made you think tears would be 
appropriate?

612
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:57,024
My,
well,

613
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,893
I'll tell you,
he's sitting at lunch and there's this 

614
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,653
girl over there and she's ignoring him 
and he just wants to share his peanut 

615
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:05,580
butter sandwich and then he,
he's like,

616
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:06,960
oh,
nobody likes me.

617
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:08,400
And that I really went for it.

618
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:12,090
I got a really felt that my parents were
like waving at me,

619
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,320
crying a little ice age,
floods of tears.

620
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,170
Charlie Brown over what some would think
of as a minor misdemeanor,

621
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:20,004
but I think in that were the seeds of 
what would become a great career as a 

622
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:26,580
performer.
One of the things you've talked about in

623
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:27,414
your show a dope is sort of neurological
and scientific representations of what 

624
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:34,800
you've experienced personally.
Just a little bit about that.

625
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,600
Well,
I mean,

626
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,543
I've watched some Ted Talks I've read.
I definitely will get it all wrong I 

627
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:43,804
think,
but I think there's this some addiction 

628
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:47,980
specialist called Gabor metallic.
Do you know him?

629
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,970
Yeah.
I'm fascinated by him.

630
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:49,804
I was reading this book last night and I
think we're going to get him on this 

631
00:29:50,771 --> 00:29:54,250
podcast.
I interviewed him for him and he's like,

632
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,530
he could have a cult.
He's so amazing.

633
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,670
His voice is so deep and he'd be.
He'd love to speak to him.

634
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,480
We interviewed him.
Tell me all about it.

635
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,180
Well,
he,

636
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:07,000
he talks about dopamine levels and I'm 
like,

637
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,043
uh,
if you.

638
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,600
One of the theories is if you have a 
dopamine deficiency,

639
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:13,120
then when you do get a hit of that 
pleasure chemical,

640
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:16,090
it's so overwhelming and then the 
cravings really intense.

641
00:30:16,091 --> 00:30:16,924
So that's what he talks about and about 
looking at the origins of addiction and 

642
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,573
in early childhood where your brain 
chemistry is all getting wired up and 

643
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,920
stuff like that.
But that can be quite uncomfortable.

644
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:29,650
I think looking at your own early 
childhood,

645
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,173
I don't know.
I.

646
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,130
It's hard as an because you want to take
full responsibility for all your actions

647
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,080
and you never want to feel like you're 
casting blame,

648
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:41,020
especially on your parents who you.
But everybody.

649
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,930
I mean we're so fragile and we've all 
got weird.

650
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,100
You know,
one of the challenges I think my,

651
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,943
if the logical model of addiction is the
kind of places people that are addicts 

652
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,353
in the position of a kind of sufferer 
through anything about it and we'll 

653
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:04,360
Poli.
It also lets the culture of the hook.

654
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,243
You know,
where there is sort of so many cultural 

655
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,264
forces that you want imagined and it 
seems to suggest exacerbate addiction 

656
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,930
inequality,
poverty,

657
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,960
persecution in talking particularly 
about within America.

658
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,800
But it's true.
It's interesting to note the theories of

659
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,603
the dopamine deficiency could be the 
biochemical root of what we identify as 

660
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:32,440
addiction.
And it would also make sense of the idea

661
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:36,550
that the patterns are replicated 
regardless of the object,

662
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:39,370
whether it's a sort of a crazy 
relationship of substance,

663
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:42,910
a career in comedy or Bet Midler who 
sort of chasing the same thing.

664
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,910
Yeah,
exactly.

665
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,010
And I think,
um,

666
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,140
I'm also been really interested in.

667
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,390
I didn't realize how like how malleable 
we are and how your,

668
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,373
how,
how you can affect your brain chemistry 

669
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,760
with just things like your social 
environment.

670
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:55,594
I mean even now as adults and you can 
boost your dopamine levels of exercise 

671
00:31:58,811 --> 00:31:59,890
and things.
I just didn't know.

672
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:02,770
We were so malleable.
You're right,

673
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:04,620
you had a sort of a fatalistic model of 
just like,

674
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:05,311
Oh,
I'm just this,

675
00:32:05,311 --> 00:32:06,144
this is how I feel.
This is something I'm learning that now 

676
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,073
go and live in the country.
Don't stimulate yourself into a frenzy 

677
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,430
to meditate twice a day,
do exercise,

678
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,353
don't look at pornography.
Like sort of like very sort of simple 

679
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:21,790
rules of how to create a spice in your 
consciousness.

680
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:24,520
That's pleasant.
I'm still getting there.

681
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,420
You've.
Yeah,

682
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,550
everything he said.
That sounds so nice.

683
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,660
Why?
What's your life like now?

684
00:32:28,661 --> 00:32:31,570
My mind just running around,
I'm on my phone a lot.

685
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,270
I don't know.
I probably drank too much.

686
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:35,190
I mean,
but I,

687
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,580
you know,
I exercise,

688
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:38,020
I eat,
I eat really well.

689
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:40,430
I'm trying to like,
it's balance isn't it?

690
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,130
I know I should live in the country.
I should live in the woods,

691
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,570
but it's hard,
isn't it?

692
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,770
Yeah.
It's pretty hot down.

693
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:46,604
Then would say,
well why haven't you got embraced an 

694
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:52,250
abstinent model if you've identified as 
an addict's quite early in your life?

695
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:55,560
And I'm going to be a really puritanical
and judgmental now for a bit.

696
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,260
It's a good question.
I mean,

697
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:58,700
I don't,
I,

698
00:32:58,701 --> 00:32:59,600
yeah,
yeah.

699
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,890
I've never,
I've never,

700
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,590
I don't drink every day.
I look good.

701
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:08,750
I know you're right.
I think the next thing to go probably,

702
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:10,150
but um,
your foot a,

703
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,810
you're successful.
So.

704
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,653
But it,
what is interesting when you in that 

705
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:16,220
position,
because I had these weird little rushing

706
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:16,730
early life.

707
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:20,270
I was like 24 and I was being on MTV and
I had a radio show on Xfm.

708
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,700
Maybe it was even coming out of one of 
these bloody rooms,

709
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,440
like this one was certainly this 
building,

710
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,620
but I'd like at that point was 
escalating as a drug addict,

711
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:28,231
you know,
when you sign,

712
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:29,064
when you,
as a young person you had access 

713
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:33,530
suddenly to ready money,
like just addiction fuel,

714
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,850
what they must have paid me.
Heroin saved me the exchange,

715
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:39,940
you know,
so like now that you're,

716
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,960
now that you're at this position,
you're becoming successful,

717
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:42,794
you're on the precipice,
I would imagine have a sort of a 

718
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,133
different kind of success,
that tipping point where we're probably 

719
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:48,540
going to get your own TV show soon 
possibly,

720
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:52,310
or make a film and those kinds of things
we're probably going to happen.

721
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,200
So like what are you going to do to stay
stable?

722
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,570
Straight and narrow?
I think,

723
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,910
um,
I mean I,

724
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,780
I've practiced pretty rigorous,
um,

725
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,960
you know,
therapy and things.

726
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:10,961
I go to Ebay and I and I surround myself
with really good people and yeah.

727
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,003
So you're in support groups and during 
therapy I go to support groups and I'm 

728
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,560
also in fair Ipi and I'm always,
what I'm continually looking for is what

729
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:22,690
is the most recent,
you know,

730
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,623
like or covenant rather,
what is the current manifestation of my 

731
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:28,760
addictive behavior and that's when it 
starts to give them the,

732
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:29,623
as we've talked through your root in a 
sort of a seemingly innocuous and 

733
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:35,450
culturally recognizable and acceptable 
forms of addiction,

734
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:36,284
right?
Until he eventually necessarily in fact 

735
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:38,324
deposits you if you're an extreme.
Addicts were right in the ass end of 

736
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:44,120
chemical dependency or if you'd have a 
less severe strain,

737
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,160
one can hover along,
you know,

738
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:49,310
sort of in banal forms of mental tyranny
through addiction.

739
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,433
Me,
what I have to do is sort of like look 

740
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:54,530
at like the thing that I like about a 12
step recovery,

741
00:34:54,531 --> 00:34:55,364
the top recovery I believe in is it 
brings you to a place that's 

742
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,940
recognizable from other forms of 
spirituality.

743
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:05,450
I stay in the moment trying not to be so
self obsessed.

744
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,840
Do Service for other people,
like things that like,

745
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:10,910
oh,
this crops up in every bloody religion.

746
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:12,740
This doesn't,
it sort of really,

747
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:16,190
really works.
That stuff keeps cropping up.

748
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:20,090
It's got to be the route to the solution
for sure.

749
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,983
I think,
um,

750
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,690
yeah,
being vigilant and uh,

751
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,150
yeah,
I got to get into nature though.

752
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,240
I mean it's,
I'm really bad with technology.

753
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:32,480
How are you with that with your five?
Like if I like what I've done now,

754
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:34,310
my friend over there,
Jenny who works here,

755
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,323
I don't have my password no more for um,
for twitter because what I do is I tell 

756
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:43,194
myself I'm just because I'm on a book to
just having a look for business reasons 

757
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,690
for long,
you know,

758
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:52,470
you get too deep into it and those,
all of those apps are designed now.

759
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,303
People that have been there come from 
Silicone Valley and works and those 

760
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:55,830
projects are saying,
you know,

761
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,860
that will deliberately designed to sort 
of trigger a response.

762
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:02,070
It's not painful.
You might decide that they're attractive

763
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:03,780
and appealing.
That's what you do.

764
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:07,470
You're not going to make an APP.
So it's bloody bullring done to do that,

765
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:08,880
isn't it?
It's crazy.

766
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,400
And everyone,
I mean everyone kind of casually says,

767
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:12,234
oh yeah,
we're all addicted to our phones and 

768
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:13,741
it's like,
no guys,

769
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:15,900
we are all addicted to our phones.
It's quite,

770
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:16,883
it's quite bad guys because like one of 
the things I've said in this article 

771
00:36:22,871 --> 00:36:26,700
that was written in the Guardian the 
other day was that like,

772
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,930
is something that your attention is 
being continually competed for.

773
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,550
You don't.
You don't know how to come down.

774
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,110
But sometimes the desire to look at my 
phone is so overwhelming.

775
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,810
It's ridiculous.
Things like light and the guy,

776
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:42,810
this guy that designed the like button 
for facebook before that,

777
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:44,850
it had been some other type of button.
He came up with it.

778
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:47,240
It's just some sort of 13.
I don't know how he does it,

779
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,440
drop it.
I can't even conceptualize my mind.

780
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,603
But you came up with a light button.
He says he don't even bring his phone 

781
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:54,800
upstairs no more.
He plugs it in,

782
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:56,610
in the kitchen at 7:00
PM and that's it.

783
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:58,260
That's the end of it.
He's like it.

784
00:36:58,261 --> 00:36:59,094
He's had his personal assistant deep 
like take all the child proofing on his 

785
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:05,880
phone.
So he himself can't download apps,

786
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,863
so the people that know the score about 
tech saying watch it because David 

787
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,933
Foster Wallace perspicacious Lee 10 
years ago or whenever he sadly died was 

788
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,070
saying we're going to win this before 
handheld phones.

789
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:17,691
Really,
I think,

790
00:37:17,691 --> 00:37:18,690
you know,
suddenly smartphones,

791
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,980
he was saying we're not far away from a 
society where you're staring at a screen

792
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:23,814
all the time and the people on the other
side of it don't love you and they just 

793
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,510
want to sell things to you.

794
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,480
And now we are living in that.
Yeah.

795
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,660
And it's also worrying with parenting 
and stuff.

796
00:37:33,661 --> 00:37:34,494
I mean you see families out and there's 
this screen between the child and the 

797
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:39,540
parent and uh,
yeah,

798
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,310
that actually,
that doctor talks about it,

799
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:45,510
about gap or does,
he says it's because it's not a physical

800
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:46,344
separation with the child,
but it's proximal separation because 

801
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:50,940
you're not making eye contact,
you're not connecting.

802
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,210
And that stuff is so crucial for brain 
development.

803
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:55,950
What does that mean?
Proximal separation?

804
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,363
I have no idea.
I think it means not physically 

805
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:00,834
separated,
but you're separate because you're in a 

806
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:03,024
different space.
Ultimately like approximate 

807
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,110
approximately proxy.
Yeah.

808
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:08,730
Right,
so the little kid in this case,

809
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:13,790
my little kid in the night garden on 
this bloody special ipad that bought for

810
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:15,384
children because a like the thing is is 
that the child does prefer in the night 

811
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:20,840
guard than to us.

812
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:24,130
It's like given the choice,
like if you asked it,

813
00:38:24,131 --> 00:38:27,330
it was you want to live with in the 
night guards or your parents would go in

814
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:29,280
the night guard and I don't even care 
about them.

815
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,263
They're idiots on board,
particularly if that one with the beard 

816
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:36,070
been like that is what people might call
it,

817
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:36,904
a cheap joke,
but it's a joke nonetheless to be 

818
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,000
encouraged in my ongoing quest to make 
up jokes.

819
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,730
Yeah.
Come in and my mindset is you identified

820
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:47,770
as an addict quite quite early in your 
life.

821
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,933
You're a person that's on the periphery 
and precipice of interesting cultural 

822
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:51,994
ideas.
You're old enough to understand it and 

823
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:53,734
to present it.
You've been working from lived 

824
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:56,030
experience,
mirror,

825
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,130
important,
fascinating.

826
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:58,930
Figure.
Tell me what you're going to do now.

827
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,170
I'm about to go on tour.
Oh yeah,

828
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,940
but it's my first tour of dope.

829
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,040
Yeah,
it's a very different tour.

830
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,710
The show called dope.
Yeah.

831
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,820
Yeah.
And it's uh,

832
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:12,220
I'm getting untrained,
some stain and ibis hotels.

833
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:13,350
I'm doing it tomorrow.
Yeah.

834
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,193
No,
I mean they got like a machine in the 

835
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:17,620
corridor that sells food.
Yeah.

836
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,890
And it's even be in the bed and also 
washing your hands at the same time.

837
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,320
There's like a little sink like the 
bathroom is within.

838
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,060
That could be convenient in some 
circumstances,

839
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,990
but mostly it's troubling.
Yeah.

840
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:32,440
My best hotels.
I'm an Ivus hotel option bird.

841
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:35,680
You're washing your hands in the sink.
You're laying there in the bed.

842
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,600
You're on tour.
How you started?

843
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,400
No,
I start tonight.

844
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:41,940
I'm going to Oxford and then a local 
playhouse,

845
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,350
a glee club.
Glee Club.

846
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,593
Ready for this?
The glee club for your whole touring 

847
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:48,681
life?
Yeah,

848
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:50,830
I think so.
It's not that crazy.

849
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,560
It shows a week.
Something about 18 shows in total,

850
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:54,700
so it's pretty cash.

851
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,910
I think I'll get friends to come visit 
me and I think it'll be fun.

852
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,190
And then I meant to be writing a book 
about,

853
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:00,820
um,
for,

854
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,720
for 14 year olds about sexuality.
So.

855
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,730
And write it while I'm on tour.
Hold on.

856
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:10,060
Let's quickly promote properly the main 
mine in a standup show.

857
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:11,680
Dope.
How do people get tickets for that?

858
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,980
Um,
I think they're on May,

859
00:40:12,981 --> 00:40:15,340
Martin Dot net.
Go on my mind.

860
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:19,660
Don't net buy tickets to see my mind.
What can I anticipate in this show?

861
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:22,300
I hate that question when I'm asked it.
Let me see if I can pose it better.

862
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,130
Tell us something about your show 
please.

863
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,993
That's good to promote it.
I mean it's everything we just talked 

864
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:30,460
about,
but with them jokes kind of.

865
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:31,683
What kind of meetings do you go in?
Are you mostly in this type of mood or 

866
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:37,150
do you sometimes go jacket and Matt or 
shouty or like,

867
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:38,920
you know,
your Charlie Brown performance?

868
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:39,963
I mostly like there's,
I guess I guess I get a little more 

869
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,293
energetic,
but I'm mostly like this extremely 

870
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:46,450
affable banks.
I think I'm,

871
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,500
I think I'm affable onstage.
I'm,

872
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,480
yeah,
you're likable,

873
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:51,730
aren't you?
I tell you what's good is,

874
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:52,564
um,
while dealing with this complex new 

875
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:57,050
language around identity and,
and people,

876
00:40:57,051 --> 00:40:57,884
the older people having to reexamine 
their unconscious prejudices is nice to 

877
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:06,990
meet people that are potentially able to
explain and convey that information,

878
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,433
but don't press buttons that you know 
decade or so ago would have prevented 

879
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,360
progress.
I get loads of people.

880
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:19,150
Well,
one more when I talked about sexuality a

881
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:19,984
lot on stage,
I'd get people bringing their parents 

882
00:41:21,821 --> 00:41:23,800
and then coming out to their parents in 
front of me.

883
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:24,634
Like they'd,
they'd wait to meet me and then they 

884
00:41:25,911 --> 00:41:27,610
choose that moment to say to their 
parents,

885
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:29,020
actually I'm,
I'm gay.

886
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:32,110
And I'm so not equipped to kind of 
mediate that exchange.

887
00:41:32,111 --> 00:41:36,380
But it was amazing and I guess they,
the parents had just seen the show.

888
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:37,570
So they're feeling of,
you know,

889
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,330
they were in a positive mood and,
and then one time a girl said,

890
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:43,340
I'm data,
I'm bisexual.

891
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,810
And then her dad said,
yeah,

892
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:46,220
me too.
It was crazy.

893
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,470
I know.
And then they asked if I wanted to go to

894
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:51,400
ga,
why our CEO Bisexual?

895
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:56,420
And he was fucking every night he's 
like,

896
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:58,580
why do you think I have this earring?
He literally said that.

897
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,870
That's my boss texture.
Leering that are way out.

898
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,310
Yeah.
That's amazing.

899
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,253
Because you go like the priest of a 
coming out into sort of a modern gender 

900
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,730
fluidity and sexual fluidity and freeing
yourself from previous paradigms.

901
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,713
I'm more,
I feel like I'm a ill-equipped 

902
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,583
sometimes,
but I get people off and confessing 

903
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:17,690
their gay things to me.

904
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,730
Like people going,
my wife is in the toilet,

905
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:22,760
but I just need to tell you.
I did give a blow job once and I'm like,

906
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:23,594
okay,
cool.

907
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,673
Yeah.
Yeah.

908
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:31,120
I'd love to show that just using you as 
a sort of a vessel for their shame about

909
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,190
their sexuality is a great pity,
isn't it?

910
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:38,540
That we've become unable to live our own
shadows.

911
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,583
That our culture has taught us,
that there are aspects of our sexual 

912
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:44,270
self and identity self.
They're unacceptable.

913
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,163
I don't want to live feeling shame and 
stuff and nothing's going to come see 

914
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:50,070
your show.
God knows what the post show river.

915
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,310
I don't know what was going on.
I kind of stuff.

916
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,390
Do you get,
I'm now talking about addiction.

917
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:03,224
Do you get loads of people coming after 
shows and talking about their own 

918
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,040
experiences?
Yeah,

919
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:09,650
there's been a slight hiatus in.
It was.

920
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,580
I've been deliberately and studiously 
promoting the book.

921
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,540
I've not gone back.
I'm back onto,

922
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,220
hey,
this is good.

923
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,053
I'm back on tour,
so like I'm going to be like Ross 

924
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,083
brand.com.
I'm on tour again for the next six 

925
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:22,214
months.
Right?

926
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,190
Yeah,
and as you I'm sure are aware,

927
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,570
I do my level best to appear messianic 
and romantic while on stage.

928
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,673
Go into the as even in the intervals to 
solve swan about like some classes with 

929
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,240
ccs of all like,
oh,

930
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,093
you'd really like it.
Like I imagine it's the end of old show 

931
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:40,280
now.
You're going to be happening now,

932
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,510
right?
Y'All could be off somewhere.

933
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,520
You should be enjoying your maltesers.
Oh No,

934
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,100
I'm just wandering around in the 
auditorium.

935
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,993
Positive my top off looking all I'm sad 
about something on the age of my mind 

936
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,770
about saying he wouldn't understand.
It's too deep.

937
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,820
Then people come up and like maybe get.
So my friend Matt,

938
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:56,920
or do the radio show,
we've.

939
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:00,900
I've seen too many folks are on 
instagram looking at your to impressing,

940
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,550
walking through touching babies and the 
dash.

941
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:04,910
Right.
I'm doing a lot of that.

942
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,500
Yeah.
Just very entrepreneurial.

943
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:07,523
Like I said,
like why don't you try a bit of that 

944
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:10,470
walking around.
Yeah.

945
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:15,320
I'm very available to available after 
the show.

946
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,850
Are you a single person currently?
Yeah.

947
00:44:18,851 --> 00:44:19,660
Yeah,
yeah.

948
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,350
Oh,
that's dangerous on tour,

949
00:44:21,351 --> 00:44:23,420
isn't it?
I mean people.

950
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,610
Yeah.
I do get a lot of couples actually.

951
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,900
That seems to be my niche.
Like we want to have a go.

952
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:33,980
That's the propositions I get from that.
I think.

953
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,823
I don't know if it was because of the 
old inculcation and acculturation early 

954
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:37,974
in life,
but I've never been that at ease around 

955
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:40,314
males and sex.
I've been at an orgy where there's been 

956
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:43,854
men and I was a younger man.
I was involved in a few free sums that 

957
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:51,231
had to man in them.
I don't need the gentleness.

958
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,410
A nurturer of femininity very much 
resonated with me.

959
00:44:55,411 --> 00:44:59,750
When you talked about Miss Midler's,
Po Matriarch,

960
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:01,890
some of the energy I'm going for,
of course,

961
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:06,720
that sort of literally a married man 
with a baby and incredibly happy now,

962
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:09,510
but if we're going to talk about one 
sexual brand,

963
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,330
is that stuff but you couples,
is it?

964
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:13,943
I get,
I get.

965
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,860
I get propositions from couples.
Yeah.

966
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,120
Post your show.
It sounds amazing.

967
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,430
Blow Job Punch.
Hey,

968
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:21,264
I'm going to go.
Why do you want to come home with us 

969
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:25,583
right now?

970
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,750
Coming on May.
It's pretty exciting.

971
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

972
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,840
I mean I just get straight back into 
bloody cabin.

973
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,890
Back to the MYP.
I spoke to a manager.

974
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,620
I'll be slamming that vandal shut.
Locked me away.

975
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:38,570
And the Ivus.
Yeah.

976
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,920
Is that really an Egyptian bird?
I think so.

977
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:41,754
It sounds like that might be true.
It's probably some sort of store 

978
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,230
probably deliver of new life.
I mean why would they have selected that

979
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:49,440
word will work out eventually everything
reappropriated by the corporate world.

980
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:50,274
Everything rebranded.
So do you ever take up these couples on 

981
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:52,771
their mat,
officer,

982
00:45:52,771 --> 00:45:54,750
Mr.
wildly inappropriate personal question,

983
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,830
isn't it?
Why would you answer that?

984
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:56,770
Um,
I ha,

985
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,610
I have but not post show.
Yeah.

986
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,513
You got to meet up any good or do you 
get sort of caught up in the social 

987
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:05,310
dynamics?
I think if I think,

988
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,144
I wouldn't mind if it was three 
individuals who just met my favorite 

989
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,710
days because with a couple they've got 
their own thing.

990
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,750
They keep telling each other.
They love each other throughout.

991
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,020
Oh yeah.
Newer on the age.

992
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,413
Nobody loves me once as a younger man in
freer and more liberal type day from 

993
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,360
love.
Share your beautiful say that.

994
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,433
Uh,
like I,

995
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:26,343
I was sleeping with two humans and them 
to humans really liked each other more 

996
00:46:30,661 --> 00:46:33,370
than me,
but I just thought it was nice that they

997
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,880
found each other via me.
If they weren't,

998
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:37,183
they were very happy together.
So it was quite amazing because it 

999
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,493
crossed over from carnality and it was 
the thing that sort of interests me 

1000
00:46:42,481 --> 00:46:43,620
about sex.
Actually.

1001
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:48,240
I've never been an overt mechanized ca 
conventionally mail person.

1002
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:49,074
It's actually,
I do enjoy the opportunity tunity for a 

1003
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:52,554
kind of transcendent union that can 
occur that there is even in the most 

1004
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:56,214
promiscuous in fleeting encounter as a 
kind of thing that feels like love very 

1005
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:01,560
much and it can't be sustained in a 
relationship,

1006
00:47:01,561 --> 00:47:04,490
but you're not asking it to do that if 
you're just banding about the hybrid.

1007
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,990
I'm banding about.
I agree though.

1008
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:07,824
I think,
um,

1009
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,090
those.
I mean,

1010
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,760
you're just getting a hit of those 
hormones.

1011
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,320
That's the same feeling of just as A.
Yeah,

1012
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,940
temporary.
Yeah,

1013
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,850
that's right.
I sort of want said like the,

1014
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:18,900
uh,
well,

1015
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:21,660
why is longevity?
The key component?

1016
00:47:21,661 --> 00:47:24,450
You can fall in love with someone just 
in a moment and that's enough.

1017
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:26,160
In fact,
George Orwell writes,

1018
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:26,994
and I quote this a lot,
it's on the first page of homage to 

1019
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:29,154
Catalonia,
one of the few pages of homage to 

1020
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:31,054
Catalonia that read it goes like he's in
line to sign up for Poom or some 

1021
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:36,850
anarchist group to fight in the Spanish 
civil war.

1022
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:40,030
And the bloke in front of him was this 
Italian gazer with ginger beer.

1023
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:44,200
And he said he loved him and he knew 
that he could love him,

1024
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,063
like just in that moment and he's never 
sort of saw him again because there's 

1025
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:50,560
something about the man that was very,
very beautiful and you know,

1026
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:53,890
these sort of senses of solidarity that 
can occur in crisis.

1027
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:56,980
This thing that we are looking for is 
connection.

1028
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,870
Definitely.
I think.

1029
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,990
Wouldn't it be nice if,
because I hate breakups.

1030
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,760
I hate it.
I don't know why we do it,

1031
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:07,250
but I think I'm imagining if there was a
two week time limit,

1032
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,084
so you meet someone,
you fall in love but you both go 

1033
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,910
microchip or something.
But if you after her weight,

1034
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:15,510
I haven't thought it through as much.
I'm done with this.

1035
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,540
It make someone two weeks months,
two weeks haven't like euphoric and then

1036
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,990
you both know after two weeks you got to
never see each other again.

1037
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:24,303
This is all good.
It's good because it prevents any 

1038
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,510
attachment.
Yeah.

1039
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:31,940
I don't know to be heartbreaking if I 
got two weeks.

1040
00:48:31,941 --> 00:48:34,630
The one thing about like marital life or
not one but one thing.

1041
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,600
One of the many things we might listen 
to this,

1042
00:48:36,601 --> 00:48:37,990
she won't,
she don't care about my career,

1043
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,633
one of the many things just in case one 
of the many things that I like about my 

1044
00:48:42,261 --> 00:48:44,840
old life is the sense and I had it this 
morning when I got out of bed.

1045
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,270
It's like,
oh please God,

1046
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,143
be going to bed with this person again 
tonight and I don't have to worry no 

1047
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:51,844
more and hopefully this life will be a 
continuation of going to bed with this 

1048
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:57,700
person and then one of us will die.
That's terrible.

1049
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:58,534
At the end.
Will building in your version yams in a 

1050
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:02,530
fortnight too much,
too quick.

1051
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,920
I know you're right.
I mean my,

1052
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:06,430
my parents are.
I'm madly in love.

1053
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:07,580
They'd been together.
Yeah,

1054
00:49:07,581 --> 00:49:08,590
it's,
it's crazy.

1055
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:11,240
Having that model of monogamy there,
there.

1056
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:12,443
I mean crazy.
Like talk about their sex life all the 

1057
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:17,950
time and just you can just see it there.
Hang on each other's words.

1058
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:20,470
It's crazy.
So I guess that can happen.

1059
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,840
Also,
it's given you,

1060
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,773
it seems like you've been developed in a
crucible where you've been able to 

1061
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,190
embrace yourself outside of what was 
formerly known as convention.

1062
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,880
Now what about this book you're writing?
That sounds quite fascinating.

1063
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:38,950
Tell me a bit more about that.
Well,

1064
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:40,900
that's tricky.
How do you,

1065
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,793
how do you do it?
How do you hit deadlines and be 

1066
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,850
disciplined about it?
So tricky.

1067
00:49:45,851 --> 00:49:48,100
I'm trying to write it now because it 
was a day.

1068
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,820
What's the total 50,000
words a day?

1069
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:52,654
You've got to make that commitment,
but it might be hard for you to do it 

1070
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:56,560
while you're on tour,
but it flows out of you.

1071
00:49:56,561 --> 00:50:00,310
I'm like typing like this and uh,
I um,

1072
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,121
yeah,
but it'll be good.

1073
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:04,750
It's the,
the idea is to write the book that you,

1074
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:08,590
that I wish I had when I was 14.
Brilliant about sexuality.

1075
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:11,230
It's a sort of fluid sexuality and so 
cool.

1076
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:13,170
And then how's it going to work?
So I don't know.

1077
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,320
Oh,
I had to write it.

1078
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,650
You're not the pragmatic.

1079
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:16,863
What is this?
What did you wish you had when you were 

1080
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:18,850
14 year old?
You?

1081
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:19,973
Um,
well I guess I had a unique experience 

1082
00:50:21,431 --> 00:50:23,010
that my parents were amazing,
but it's,

1083
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,990
um,
it's a combination of pr,

1084
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,800
embarrassing personal anecdotes about 
sexuality,

1085
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:32,950
want to do and embarrassing anecdote to 
one to one do an embarrassing anecdotes.

1086
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:34,563
I mean,
I think I'm going to tell this story 

1087
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:41,600
about my brother when he was a toddler.
One underneath the.

1088
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,720
This is not embarrassing to me.
So it's easy to volunteer people.

1089
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:45,663
We all heard about an article titled 
Under the Table And my dad was like a 

1090
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:51,500
nudist.
He's always naked and uh,

1091
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,530
has an enormous penis.
My father and he is sitting there and my

1092
00:50:57,531 --> 00:51:02,390
brother toddled under the table and bit 
that the tip of my dad's Dick.

1093
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,430
And um,
my dad,

1094
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,260
I forget what the punchline of the 
story,

1095
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,210
fine one because of the story is your 
profit.

1096
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:13,663
So if we don't find some conclusion,
we're all left with the image I know to 

1097
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:21,770
do with helping 14 year old come out 
with gender fluidity.

1098
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:22,783
Now so far what we've got massive willy 
little profit goes onto the Typo by 

1099
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,333
showed that on the Willie and we've made
the wrong choice with anecdotes asked 

1100
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:34,630
for an embarrassing one.
Well that was challenging.

1101
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:37,400
That was a challenge though.
I think.

1102
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:39,410
What the.
Yeah,

1103
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,400
yeah,
yeah.

1104
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,263
It's the only dirt I have in my brother.
He's lived the cleanest life and I 

1105
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:45,283
remind them of it.
So that's good to keep me with your 

1106
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,640
property is just trying to get on with 
his life as a professional person.

1107
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:52,320
Here I am doing this.
That on the tape.

1108
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:53,154
So that's before you start judging me 
for being at the vanguard of new 

1109
00:51:56,871 --> 00:52:00,890
identity politics and being a book 
geiling and Roger in this one.

1110
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:01,723
The finger up on the stage,
there's never forget that day were you 

1111
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:05,730
bit down,
but they all got new.

1112
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,120
Stopped bringing out when he says,
Oh,

1113
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:09,770
I've never done anything with the guy.
And I go,

1114
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,003
well,
dad's massive deck and the emphasis of 

1115
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:17,390
the size,
which in a sense the story didn't need.

1116
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,510
No,
I know you did that,

1117
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,040
which I think gave the story real sort 
of white.

1118
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:26,840
He never watches this here.
Is it a brother or your dad?

1119
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:27,853
Either.
We don't want anyone and that it was 

1120
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:31,570
meant to be an embarrassing story about 
you may.

1121
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,770
Yeah.
Where is that story?

1122
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:34,560
Um,
I,

1123
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,750
uh,
I talk about,

1124
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:36,584
um,
I,

1125
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,850
my first boyfriend was called Ian Peach 
and uh,

1126
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,450
that was his real name and then um,
we,

1127
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,353
he broke up with me and um,
and then years later I was doing an 

1128
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:47,900
interview and they said,
why do you think you're gay?

1129
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:48,763
Which is tricky question and I'll also 
just a lot of assumptions in that 

1130
00:52:52,551 --> 00:52:53,384
question,
but I,

1131
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,570
yeah.
And I just panicked and said,

1132
00:52:56,571 --> 00:52:57,404
well,
maybe nph.

1133
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:58,363
But they misquote him in.
They heard maybe eating a peach and so 

1134
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:03,470
it was a bizarre and they refuse to 
change it.

1135
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,430
They're like,
that's what you said.

1136
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:05,700
No,
he page.

1137
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,880
Look here,
we're using the yearbook.

1138
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,850
Yeah,
no,

1139
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,050
that doesn't make sense.
I'll put page,

1140
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:13,760
but he in a page that was half,
let's face it,

1141
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:14,923
powerful potent undertones,
which seemed to have been present 

1142
00:53:18,531 --> 00:53:19,364
throughout much of this interview.
And occasionally they spike into 

1143
00:53:21,651 --> 00:53:26,651
awareness in some ghoulish familial.
The image of you in an ips bed.

1144
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,410
My mom has a google alert set up with my
name,

1145
00:53:31,411 --> 00:53:32,880
you know,
anytime my name comes up,

1146
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:33,743
she gets an email,
so then she got an email with that 

1147
00:53:35,221 --> 00:53:39,210
interview about eating a peach was I got
this phone call like it's really how you

1148
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:41,370
feel as if we gave your brother the same
peaches.

1149
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:43,470
I don't know what there was so stressed 
about it.

1150
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:48,140
And your father must be a man that's 
constantly on the precipice,

1151
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:53,180
worrying about the tip of his John 
Really off fall under the offspring,

1152
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:54,690
but yeah.
Yeah.

1153
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,090
Extraordinary and magnificent person.
You are.

1154
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:00,900
Let's make sure that we've covered 
everything that we need to cover.

1155
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,220
Right?
You're writing that book.

1156
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,190
Can everyone please calm down?
Right?

1157
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:06,420
Is that you're definitely going to call 
it.

1158
00:54:06,421 --> 00:54:08,880
That one's not going to be out.
I don't know if you've got other ideas.

1159
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:11,550
I'm coming out and calm down.
Sounds quite good.

1160
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:12,480
Quite good.
Might be too long,

1161
00:54:12,481 --> 00:54:14,340
but I quite like it.
I'm not very good at titles.

1162
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:17,130
Quite good.
July comes out.

1163
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,140
Good.
Brilliant.

1164
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,273
And also,
you're on tour now and we should go to 

1165
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:23,124
my mind.net
to get our tickets when I'll come and 

1166
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:26,940
see you.
I'll come and see you somewhere.

1167
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,893
That'd be great.
Maybe we're in the same place at the 

1168
00:54:28,951 --> 00:54:30,330
same time,
right?

1169
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:32,490
I mean that'd be confusing for the 
audience.

1170
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:37,050
Be Very silly.
That's the second joke.

1171
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,430
In an hour timeframe for a man calling 
himself a professional comedian,

1172
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:43,590
charging money.
Zero jokes.

1173
00:54:43,591 --> 00:54:47,280
But I've had a nice time.
You're very beguiling and charming after

1174
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:50,400
a book signing recently,
this person identifying as binary and I,

1175
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:51,323
we ran into each other in the park and 
we perched on a bench together and I 

1176
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:55,410
said,
explain this to me.

1177
00:54:55,411 --> 00:54:59,340
Will you then as we're here.
And they explained to me,

1178
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,533
well what it is is like I don't feel 
like I want to identify with either of 

1179
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:04,824
those categories.
I'm an actor and now we're going to go 

1180
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:09,720
to this school and learned about acting.
And I felt lucky.

1181
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:10,783
I felt sort of both old and young 
simultaneously as I reached across time 

1182
00:55:13,591 --> 00:55:15,690
to this person and they explained new 
grammar,

1183
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,540
new words,
and I realized that the important thing,

1184
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:19,374
the thing that all of us have to learn 
is a kind of nonjudgment and a 

1185
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,890
willingness to let go of our systems of 
categorization because not only are they

1186
00:55:25,891 --> 00:55:26,724
impeding others,
they're probably impeding ourselves and 

1187
00:55:28,231 --> 00:55:29,064
facilitating this bizarre tendency we 
have as human beings to cast our shadow 

1188
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,353
outwards,
whether that's as individuals or as 

1189
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:35,280
whole societies.

1190
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,113
You see the role of many,
many oppressed and persecuted groups 

1191
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:43,380
being to bear the hedge monies,
inability to look at it's wound,

1192
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:44,243
the inability or the power base of the 
United States to own its own wound or 

1193
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,553
currently what we would term as 
Islamophobia or many of the things 

1194
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:55,080
emerging from the various forms of 
identity politics.

1195
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,290
So it sort of.
I can feel something shifting in my head

1196
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:00,400
that are kind of quite.
Is it good?

1197
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:01,410
Yeah.
That's so good.

1198
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:03,160
That's so exciting.
Same though.

1199
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:04,980
Yeah,
and it's changing all the time.

1200
00:56:04,981 --> 00:56:05,371
It's.
Yeah,

1201
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:06,720
it's.
I think it's an exciting time.

1202
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:07,583
At least that's a positive thing we can.
I mean I think a demonstrably positive 

1203
00:56:11,461 --> 00:56:12,294
thing that that these things are 
shifting and there's so much badness 

1204
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,074
going on that's a really positive thing 
that people are changing their thoughts 

1205
00:56:19,561 --> 00:56:23,660
on labels and identity and I think that 
we're headed in the right direction then

1206
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,990
that's a pretty simple thing we can sort
out as humans.

1207
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,823
You think like we could,
should be able to do that overhead is 

1208
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:30,003
making a lot of people a bit cross,
but I think they're are going to be 

1209
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:33,310
ultimately.
All right,

1210
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:33,880
I've,
I've,

1211
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,730
I think it will be very freeing and 
liberating for a lot of people that sort

1212
00:56:36,731 --> 00:56:39,910
of come scrambling up to you after your 
show.

1213
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:44,800
Don't worry me.
It's going to be all right.

1214
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

1215
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,570
Oh my mind.
That's been a really,

1216
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,413
really wonderful interview.
Let me make sure that I've done all my 

1217
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:52,840
proper jobs,
proper jobs,

1218
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:57,841
done proper jobs than Promo Promo Dad.
There's no way my is bisexual.

1219
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:00,263
That's what made my thinks.
We need to reframe the way we think 

1220
00:57:02,921 --> 00:57:06,280
about sexuality and refers to the 
Statler of scent to be 125.

1221
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,413
Don't identify as gay or straight.
I like that because that for me seems 

1222
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:12,910
like the evolution of consciousness,
like young people coming through,

1223
00:57:12,911 --> 00:57:13,744
they're smart and now our awakening,
they're not gonna accept the old ways 

1224
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:20,350
and the old old codes,
brilliant friends in Canada who,

1225
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,650
I mean I guess they're straight like 
they've only ever been with the opposite

1226
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:24,484
sex but they're just not going to call 
myself that because what if I meet 

1227
00:57:26,381 --> 00:57:28,840
someone tomorrow and then I have to come
out like that's stressful,

1228
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,840
so why not never say anything and then 
he never had the stress.

1229
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:34,330
Do you know much about what's going on 
in affiliation with users?

1230
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,183
Is around sort of no platforming,
particularly within academia within 

1231
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:38,404
Canada.
Do you know anything about that sort of 

1232
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:39,880
stuff?
Not really.

1233
00:57:39,881 --> 00:57:41,440
I hear that phrase.
What does that mean?

1234
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,713
It means like some people can't talk at 
colleges because I've said something in 

1235
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:49,570
offense or something offensive often 
around identity politics,

1236
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:52,420
but I don't know much about it,
but I know it's affected eg.

1237
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:57,570
Jermaine greer around gender identity 
and Pete attachable around lgb hold on a

1238
00:57:58,301 --> 00:58:00,370
second.
LGBTQ issues.

1239
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,473
So if you're my age,
both of those people standard sort of 

1240
00:58:04,871 --> 00:58:08,920
great civil rights giants.
So it's sort of interesting.

1241
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,990
Curious.
But it's no reason why you have to be.

1242
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:13,540
They're gonna afford.
I've no idea,

1243
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:14,860
but it is so interesting.
Yeah.

1244
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:16,690
I don't know where.
I don't know.

1245
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:17,950
It's tricky.
Yeah.

1246
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:20,470
With freedom of speech and then also you
don't.

1247
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,663
I'm in,
you don't want to incite hatred and 

1248
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:26,020
violence and stuff.
So it's very.

1249
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,970
We're in,
we're breaking new ground.

1250
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,670
I don't know if there is a right answer.
I think we'll do.

1251
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,513
Why?
Up to student bodies I guess to take to 

1252
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:37,210
sort of discuss it amongst themselves 
and have a majority.

1253
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:38,650
I think you're right.
I am a student.

1254
00:58:38,651 --> 00:58:39,710
Did you know that?
I go to.

1255
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:42,790
So as university I'm just a young 
student making me wait for it.

1256
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:43,624
I'm just lucky kid with a dream.
I suppose my learning very little 

1257
00:58:46,931 --> 00:58:47,764
because I can't focus on that so as.
And I'm doing religion and global 

1258
00:58:49,841 --> 00:58:53,050
politics and I think today or tomorrow 
I've got to go to a new module,

1259
00:58:53,051 --> 00:58:53,884
which is the origins of Yoga in India.
I think last year I was doing lots of 

1260
00:58:57,551 --> 00:58:58,750
stuff about,
Gosh,

1261
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:01,030
secularism.
The role of religion,

1262
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,140
rationality versus irrationality.

1263
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,420
Beats for advent of protestantism in 
this.

1264
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,360
Oh my God.
So much stuff.

1265
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:09,220
West fading tree in my mind is full of 
stuff.

1266
00:59:09,221 --> 00:59:12,230
Michel Foucault.
The brain's just brimming over with clap

1267
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,690
trap.
So good though.

1268
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,680
It is good,
isn't it?

1269
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:17,050
Toward Yourself.
Up with the old bit of cleverness.

1270
00:59:17,051 --> 00:59:17,884
Just in case you in an argument one day.
Definitely reach into that little 

1271
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:23,300
cupboard and knowledge.
I love all that.

1272
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:24,223
I mean it's a whole other conversation,
but I'm big into Joseph Campbell and 

1273
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:28,670
stuff.
So good,

1274
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:29,280
isn't it?
I would.

1275
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,190
I'd like to go back to school.
Maybe I could do that.

1276
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:33,720
Listen,
you malleable kid.

1277
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,720
You're wondering around you wanting to 
move to the country.

1278
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,083
Your family members are fighting each 
other on my big frigging try to 

1279
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:46,010
university to learn more about 
perennialism and myth,

1280
00:59:46,011 --> 00:59:46,844
which I am also fascinated by because in
a way we have to become the hero of our 

1281
00:59:49,641 --> 00:59:50,080
own lives.

1282
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:50,913
It's not actually about empirical 
evidence is about belief and faith and 

1283
00:59:54,231 --> 00:59:58,610
becoming a sort of a journey of becoming
a becoming a hero in your own existence.

1284
00:59:58,611 --> 00:59:59,444
We,
I can certainly say that you seem to 

1285
01:00:00,351 --> 01:00:01,184
have been.
It's been very difficult for me to not 

1286
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,313
come over there and cut a little bit too
hard because I'm planning to do first 

1287
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:06,764
opportunity.
Okay.

1288
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,150
My mind,
thanks for coming in.

1289
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,860
Thank you so much.
People can come and see you.

1290
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:11,480
I think you're wonderful and charming.
Thanks.

1291
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,310
Thank you so much for having me.
Thank you.

1292
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,600
So exciting.
Been good,

1293
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:15,434
isn't it?
Yeah.

1294
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,240
Really good.
Couple of darlings.

1295
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:20,990
Thanks.

Very good.

1299
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:28,610
Getting older,
but imagine this voice now,

1300
01:00:28,611 --> 01:00:29,630
but reading a book at you.

1301
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:33,500
Love it and come and see the rebirth

It's going to be great night.

1303
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,430
London,
Apollo.

1304
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:41,130
Fear flow first of October,
first of November or so.

1305
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,320
A lot of stars are coming that night.
It's going to be a loss of labs there.

1306
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,990
It's going to be a big night,
not in a second of November,

1307
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:48,883
probably a bit.
I don't know who's not in a nitrile 

1308
01:00:50,691 --> 01:00:53,360
cliff might be their coventry,
even November,

1309
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,750
locking,
less stuff over in November.
