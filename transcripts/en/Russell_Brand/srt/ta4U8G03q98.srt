1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
Curiously,
I've been listening to a lot of George 

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,713
Orwell audiobooks,
and it's amazing because there's these 

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,500
huge passages where he thinks,
oh my God,

4
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,210
what incredible foresight,
how amazing.

5
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:10,350
And then there's I'm a bitchy thing.
Oh no,

6
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:11,940
that's not how it turned out.
Oh,

7
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,150
like Hitler has not yet kicked off in 
that the road to Wigan pier is going,

8
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:16,410
I don't like to look at,
they sit at the bloke,

9
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:18,170
I think he's going to be trouble.
Yeah,

10
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,023
I've got quick George do something.
But then there's like a speculation 

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,430
about like how other things are going to
pan out and it sort of a,

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,563
you know,
like this is the necessity for 

13
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:29,004
socialism.
He does point out that like that 

14
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,960
socialism's requirement for 
mechanization and a mechanized utopia.

15
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:34,794
We'll foul and I can't help but return 
to something that Gandy said prior to 

16
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,190
the Indian revolution throughout the 
British.

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,023
There's no point in overthrowing the 
British in order to simply replace them 

18
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:47,870
and their systems.
And Gandy failed and disrespect.

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,713
I mean,
Gandhi had a vision of turning India 

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,590
into this collection of Agrarian Turkic 
Utopias.

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,660
And the only thing left of Gandhi's 
vision in the core and Indian economy is

22
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:04,710
his image on these rupee notes.
That's the only thing left.

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,860
And this is partly because,
you know,

24
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,830
Gandhi's analysis,
uh,

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,140
was inappropriate for the 20th century.
You couldn't,

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,350
I mean,
it's a very nice vision to have India as

27
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:17,184
a collection of agrarian utopias.
It's just irrelevant to how the economy 

28
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:25,020
functions in the late 20th century.
When you say functions,

29
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,883
you know,
functions in order to suit the needs of 

30
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:29,064
the powerful,
it would have functioned pretty bloody 

31
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:31,254
good for most agrarian Indian villages.
It just wouldn't have functioned well 

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,290
for the capitalist relationships that 
needed to be maintained.

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,213
Whether or not it was the British in 
charge or the Indians that were in 

34
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:41,020
charge.
Um,

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,561
again,
I,

36
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:45,450
I don't know what exactly went wrong,
but from the very beginning,

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,880
uh,
certainly Nairu and the,

38
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:48,714
and the leadership did not try to 
implement Gandhi's vision in a serious 

39
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,950
way,
largely because they also realized,

40
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:57,030
I mean,
it's,

41
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,910
it's not workable because most people 
want power.

42
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,410
Ultimately.
First of all,

43
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:02,790
they want food.
I mean,

44
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,720
you could narrow that food,
you know,

45
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,080
narratives never discussing whether or 
not he was going to have food.

46
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:10,470
He's getting food personally,
the Indian people.

47
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,790
But when you have,
you know,

48
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:16,590
we have a one point something billion 
Indians to feed,

49
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,750
then,
uh,

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,633
you don't have a lot of room for errors 
or fraud maneuvers in the economic 

51
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:24,870
field.
Now,

52
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,170
the amazing thing is that today in 
India,

53
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,920
more people die from eating too much 
than from eating too little.

54
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,190
Even in India,
it's not just in the west.

55
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,440
So for me,
that's just a perversion.

56
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,580
Like that's just,
well,

57
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,110
that's mental.
We need to enough full system.

58
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,973
Yeah.
And so if there's not enough so then we 

59
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,700
can abandon the idea that scarcity is 
the problem.

60
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,370
Organization is the problem.
There's too much food here.

61
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,950
There's not enough food over there.
Why is the food not gain over there?

62
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,813
It doesn't suit the interest of the 
powerful to the food for the food to go 

63
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:56,364
over there.
How do we affect the interest of the 

64
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,044
powerful we organize ourselves,
we challenge the interest of the 

65
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,084
powerful.
Who are the powerful is these companies 

66
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,850
here,
these governmental organizations here?

67
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,580
Key question to know who are the 
powerful world power is in?

68
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,850
How does it function?
It's very complicated.

69
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,933
You mean the power is concealed?
The true power without getting too 

70
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:16,924
conspiratorial?

71
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,763
Yeah.
I mean certainly the modern world for a 

72
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,230
couple of centuries,
one of the main functions of power is to

73
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:25,960
conceal power.
There is kind of a low of history.

74
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,280
If you don't have a lot of power,
you try to exaggerate your power.

75
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,340
If you have a lot of power,
you try to conceal it.

76
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,150
If you're a king in England in the 12th 
century,

77
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,133
you don't have a lot of power,
but you tried to conceal your weakness 

78
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,993
by these extravagant displays of power.
So you go with like a pile of gold on 

79
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:48,874
your head and you were all these furs 
and pearls and every now and then you 

80
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,650
tell people,
okay,

81
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,380
cut off his head and that makes people 
feel,

82
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:57,550
oh,
he's very powerful.

83
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,770
But actually he's very weak.
Uh,

84
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,813
because the state is fairly weak.
Then you move to the modern age and 

85
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,250
leaders in governments really have 
enormous amount of power but they won't,

86
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,380
don't want to attract too much attention
to it.

87
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,390
So you know that they dressed plainly 
like an ordinary person and uh,

88
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:19,250
they,
they live in a much lower light.

89
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,400
They don't go about telling people,
okay,

90
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,430
cut off his head because they don't want
to draw attention to all that power.

91
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,873
So in point,
it's very difficult to know where power 

92
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:31,654
really lies in the 21st century.
Pageantry conceals ordinariness our 

93
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:39,340
flags out precessions all these,
all this pageantry,

94
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:40,174
all this ritual,
all this ceremony helps us to believe 

95
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,820
there is a United States of America.
There is an,

96
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:49,390
England is not just a sort of an 
economic idea and a bit of land and some

97
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:51,280
powerful people exploiting the 
vulnerable.

98
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,720
It's a thing.
It's a flag.

99
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:53,950
There's an eagle,
there's a symbol,

100
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:55,930
there's a history.
It's real,

101
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,913
but bit by bit who am picking you on 
stitch and you discover there's nothing 

102
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:03,970
there except some powerful people 
exploiting some people without power.

103
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,550
That is your America,
that is your England,

104
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,760
that is you're Israel,
you're Saudi Arabia.

105
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,863
All just myths and stories so that the 
powerful can continue to exploit the 

106
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:18,550
powerlessness,
whether it's a crown on her head or some

107
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,384
stars and stripes on a flag.
So first thing that people have to be 

108
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,640
disabused of is their myths of 
nationalism.

109
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,940
Or then whatever method it is that's 
preventing them from acting in their own

110
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,783
interests.
It's more complicated and complicated 

111
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,410
and that cause I'll get people moving.
Take for example the,

112
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:34,781
the,
the,

113
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:35,614
the Arab spring.
So it all started off very 

114
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,330
optimistically,
like wonderful.

115
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:42,640
We have a democratic revolution of the 
people.

116
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:46,990
The people now gain power and it was 
hijacked and the collage,

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,300
the curves were turned in the wrong 
direction.

118
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,570
And we now have a much worse situation 
than before.

119
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,950
I mean Egyptians and Syrians and people 
in,

120
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:56,950
in,
in Yemen and in,

121
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,880
and they look back and we said,
this is not why we had the revolution.

122
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,560
Something really,
really failed.

123
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,050
Yes.
Because I think they had no idea.

124
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,213
The Islamic Brotherhood have an idea 
whether you liked the idea or you don't 

125
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,320
like the idea.
This is our idea.

126
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,570
This is how we see society.
This is our vision.

127
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,830
The people that are on twitter don't 
have a vision for the site.

128
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,210
That's why I think it's,
it's dangerous just to go out,

129
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,390
say on twitter and tell people,
okay,

130
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,940
go to the streets,
take out the Kalashnikovs,

131
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:29,010
fight against power.
So it,

132
00:06:29,011 --> 00:06:29,551
it,
you know,

133
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:32,160
you can,
you can have a week off revolution,

134
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,110
but then if you don't really understand 
the actual palace structure,

135
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,960
then your revolution will be hijacked 
and directed in,

136
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,391
in,
in,

137
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:42,990
in,
in,

138
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,823
uh,
towards goals which are not necessarily 

139
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,360
the best goals in the world.
For example,

140
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:53,361
like Spain in the 30s,
brief flicker of an Arco Cinder colorism

141
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,940
ultimately becomes,
fascism,

142
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,210
becomes neo.

143
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,570
I know so many examples of neo is a 
century ago in Russia,

144
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,613
you heard the Bolshevik revolution,
and within a very short time you heard 

145
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:07,000
stallion and the gulags and,
and,

146
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:09,100
and so forth.
And um,

147
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,680
you know,
by within two or three years,

148
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,543
the Bolsheviks were firing on the 
workers and peasants that they were 

149
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:18,490
supposed to represent.
You have the,

150
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:19,324
the famous case of,
of the crunch dot sailors in the garage 

151
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,860
dot workers,
which in 1917,

152
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,530
we're kind of the avant garde of the 
revolution.

153
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,543
And by the end of the revolution,
the Bolshevik government was massive 

154
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:34,330
caring.
They're very same workers in crunch dot.

155
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,120
Which in the beginning where the big 
heroes of the revolution,

156
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,700
it depends on whether you have an 
optimistic perspective or not.

157
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:40,534
There's some days where I feel human 
beings are capable of creating this 

158
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:45,040
utopia.
I believe it.

159
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,890
I believe that this technology can be 
harnessed to create,

160
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,983
uh,
more,

161
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,400
uh,
in a world of justice and liberty then,

162
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,640
then I'll hear like about some terrible 
refugee crises in Burma and think,

163
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,870
oh Jesus,
let's just leave it as it is now.

164
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,511
And this is I,
you know,

165
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:02,170
I don't know cause I didn't want to 
travel then when the aggravation,

166
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,230
but to return for a moment to the 
optimistic perspective,

167
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,460
if you can identify the powerful and you
can,

168
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:12,640
and you have a vision of a society that 
could be differently organized.

169
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,410
This for me is to ingredient.
That's a big if,

170
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,940
I mean,
if you look today the world,

171
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:20,840
what strikes me most is that nobody,
as far as I can tell,

172
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,640
nobody in either the left or the right 
has any serious,

173
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:26,474
meaningful vision for where you monitor 
will be in 2015 most of what you get is 

174
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,850
nostalgic fantasies about the past.
Yes.

175
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,713
But you don't have a serious vision,
which takes into account a I and 

176
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:45,071
biotechnology and climate change in all 
that and really looks clearly at what,

177
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,560
where can we be in 2015

178
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,883
wow.
