00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
Welcome to under the skin where I ask 
what's beneath the surface of people we 

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:06,330
admire of the ideas that define our time
of the history.

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:07,164
We are told,

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,570
Russell brand.

12
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,483
Under the skin.
We look under the superficial cutaneous 

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,190
surface of issues individually,
histories,

14
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:01,750
myths,
and stories.

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,410
Today we will be talking to will store 
an award winning writer,

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,293
a man who,
if you were to accuse him of being a 

17
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:09,154
photographer for even a moment,
it would smash any camera in the 

18
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:12,784
district.
Is features have appeared in various 

19
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:16,600
publications including the Guardian,
The Times,

20
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:17,434
the observer and Gq.
He's the author of the critically 

21
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:22,690
acclaimed books,
the heretics adventures with the enemies

22
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:25,210
of science and the novel,
the hunger,

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,560
and the howling of killing loan.
We're here to talk about his book,

24
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,900
Selfie among other things and topics 
that come off,

25
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:36,901
selfie to discover the ideal of where 
the perfect idea of self came from,

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,170
White,
so powerful on wherever there is any way

27
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:42,760
to break it.
Dangerous,

28
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,730
spelled as a fair introduction will 
often as extremely fair.

29
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,620
Thank you Russell.
Thanks for coming on our show,

30
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:49,020
mate.
It's really nice to talk to you now.

31
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:50,080
This is one.
Those ones were like,

32
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:51,760
I don't.
We don't know each other,

33
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:54,100
but we've had quite a good chat before 
the podcast started,

34
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:55,620
haven't we?
We have a very good chat.

35
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,563
Yeah.
We plunged right in with the nature of 

36
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:02,350
reality as experienced through computer 
games,

37
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:03,184
which pretty good place to start because
one of the things with this point in 

38
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:05,674
this podcast is to.
I'm going to university doing this 

39
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:10,810
course,
religion and global politics.

40
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:13,160
It may make gave me a thirst and an 
excitement.

41
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,470
That knowledge I've always been proud 
of.

42
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:18,850
My is in the Noyce or I learned that 
mean and then actually I've learned some

43
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:19,511
things.
I think no,

44
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:23,050
it's really good to distill and to 
understand and have some of the language

45
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:23,884
of academia.
So that's the point of interest is you 

46
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,850
know,
what's this book Selfie?

47
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,713
I've just read a brief intro and 
obviously understand what the modern 

48
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:32,314
term means.
What do you want people to get from 

49
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:35,164
reading that book?

50
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,280
What it is is the,
it's the,

51
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:40,800
it's the story of the Western self.
So what it's doing is saying that,

52
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:41,260
you know,
in,

53
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,093
in our modern culture we're surrounded 
by this image of the perfect self and 

54
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,400
it's a really particular kind of odd 
image.

55
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:51,330
It's this person in their twenties and 
they have this fat stomach and they kind

56
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:55,230
of are very entrepreneurial and they're 
kind of globally minded and they kind of

57
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:56,064
look a certain way and act a certain way
and it's really sort of telling the 

58
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,560
story of,
you know,

59
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,380
who is this person and and kind of how 
it,

60
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,523
how did it come to be?
What'd you reckon that's come from 

61
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,070
classicism?
Yeah.

62
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:06,904
So I think the story really begins for 
me two and a half thousand years ago in 

63
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:10,504
ancient Greece and I was really amazed 
by this whole body of psycholo 

64
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,843
psychological research I came across 
that talks about this idea of the 

65
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:23,071
geography of thought and it's this idea 
that who we are as a people is very much

66
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,640
a product of all.

67
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,503
Back then it was geography.
So in ancient Greece is a code really 

68
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,533
particular an unusual place.
So it wasn't like a nation of what you 

69
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,343
think of.
It just acts like 100 individual city 

70
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,200
states and there was a very particular 
ecology and ancient Greece.

71
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:37,750
So it's mostly,
I mean,

72
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,643
I'm sure you've been to Greece,
but like it's mountains descending to 

73
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:40,654
see a little rocky islands.
So what you couldn't do in ancient 

74
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:43,630
Greece was you couldn't be like a 
farmer,

75
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:45,370
like in East Asia,
there was like big,

76
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,100
big irrigation projects as big rice 
grain projects.

77
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,530
So to get along and get ahead of it at 
the same time.

78
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,450
Yet at the same time in,
in East Asia,

79
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,760
uh,
you know,

80
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,740
you had to be a part of a collective 
enterprise.

81
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,980
But in ancient Greece it was different 
dsp,

82
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,820
a hustler because there was no big 
industry,

83
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:02,980
so you have to be a potter or uh,
or you know,

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,340
to make olive oil or to be a fisherman 
and um,

85
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,070
and so you had to be yet to sort of push
yourself forwards.

86
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,933
And the other kind of ramification of it
being so coastal was that they started 

87
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:13,984
trading with all these other countries 
and so they began sharing ideas and 

88
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,090
coming across sort of new and novel 
ideas.

89
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,440
And that kind of encourages is this a 
tradition of debate?

90
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:25,930
So debate was like a big thing you could
do and,

91
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,500
and so,
so the,

92
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,353
the ecology forms this kind of way of 
being this kind of individualistic way 

93
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,420
of seeing the world.
And then from that comes all these ideas

94
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:35,280
of,
you know,

95
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,970
what is a human,
what a human is,

96
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:37,804
this kind of individual node of 
potential perfection and destiny rather 

97
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,290
than us being a collective,
uh,

98
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,001
part of,
uh,

99
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:45,290
uh,
just,

100
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,590
just one could have node in a kind of 
collective reality.

101
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,310
So you see interesting things in ancient
Greece beginning,

102
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:54,730
obviously there's the myth of Narcissus,
which is very relevant today,

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,833
but things like that,
they venerate celebrity do the myth of 

104
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:00,410
narcissus just in case people are 
listening to this,

105
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:01,630
I don't know nothing about.

106
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,463
And it says,
I've been listening to me for anything 

107
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,420
because a pretty good idea.
Well let's say in ancient Greece that,

108
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,050
you know,
they,

109
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,883
they,
they had,

110
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,880
they had this kind of version of 
celebrity and they would tell you know,

111
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,390
these,
these great myths and one of one of them

112
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:14,224
has courses.
It's got narcissists who fell in love 

113
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:16,504
with his own own image and the other 
thing that you get literally then it is 

114
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,740
reflection and then fault.
Oh my God,

115
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:23,930
this kid is lovely.
Yeah.

116
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,440
I think I'd like to get in there and 
snuggle him.

117
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,020
And then did he drown?
Think he drowned?

118
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:29,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

119
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,080
In a way it's stupid like not to go out 
on them and it was like a moment ago and

120
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:40,150
he's wearing those earrings and that top
I put on reflection,

121
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,193
but I suppose the point of a myth,
sorry about that noise that we were in 

122
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:45,880
this place where there's continual 
construction,

123
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,743
maybe it's a metaphor like,
like it's as opposed to the point of 

124
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:51,574
that myth is about how it's easy to get 
lost in the self and to make this self 

125
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:55,420
total.

126
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,540
And that's why it's relevant.
New York.

127
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,850
It's no coincidence that the ancient 
Greek myth,

128
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,684
because it was this,
it was this whole environment where the 

129
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:05,750
individual was seen as this node of kind
of possibility.

130
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,690
And so I contrast this in Selfie with 
what was going on in,

131
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,250
in,
in East Asia at the time.

132
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:14,100
And that was the land of Confucius.
And so to get along and get ahead in,

133
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,680
in East Asia,
you had to,

134
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,170
you know,
be part of this sort of big group.

135
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,880
And their idea of the perfect stuff was 
totally opposite to the aristotle.

136
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:23,950
He notion,
uh,

137
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:24,500
you know,
the,

138
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,140
the idea of somebody who seeks notoriety
was,

139
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,003
was known as the inferior self and the 
superior self doesn't seek that 

140
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:32,750
notoriety,
so and so that,

141
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,950
that all feels like ancient history and 
it is ancient history,

142
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,803
but it's all really relevant today.
So when these psychologists do these 

143
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:42,170
studies on,
on Westerners versus East Asians,

144
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:44,680
they say that they,
they literally see the world in,

145
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,560
in a different way.

146
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,820
So if you put a Westerner in front of,
uh,

147
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,253
they,
they show a video of a fish tank for 

148
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:53,720
three seconds and then the front of a 
fish tank because this very flashy show,

149
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:55,820
offy narcissistic kind of fish,
right?

150
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,920
And,
um,

151
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,753
it sounds like a bloody good guy.
He's that and then monitor the movement 

152
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,213
of your eyeballs every millisecond.
And what they find is that if you're a 

153
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:07,904
westerner,
you will pretty much be studying that 

154
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,780
individualistic,
narcissistic fish at the front.

155
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,220
But if you're from East Asia,
your,

156
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:15,860
I will be constantly moving and judge 
looking at the context.

157
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,380
So they're literally seeing the world in
a different way.

158
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,860
And this has major ramifications even 
down to how we take selfies.

159
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,700
So when you,
when they,

160
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,533
when they study the content of selfies,
East Asian selfies are much more likely 

161
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:29,000
to be a big group of mates,
a big gang of people together.

162
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,330
But Western self is a much more focused 
on the individual narcissistic face.

163
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,533
So huge sort of huge ramifications.
And it all begins with the ecology of 

164
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:42,860
our people 2000 years ago,
which I just found extraordinary.

165
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,020
Well,
I like that story.

166
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,153
That's a good story.
I like to think about that little show 

167
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,020
of fish.
I can't stop thinking about him.

168
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,440
I want to see him.
He sounds like a right little,

169
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,283
lovely name getting more out if me that 
have tried to track my own movements 

170
00:07:58,341 --> 00:07:59,174
that have gotten always looking at it.
He's putting his hand in the fish tank 

171
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,060
kitchen named Caitlyn it.
Even in his own name,

172
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:06,910
he took it off.
I might come back yet.

173
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,240
And that to follow me on.
CCTV footage just darted off.

174
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,733
So I'm like,
the things that we think of as the 

175
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:17,090
central such as our attitude towards 
individualism are themselves constructs.

176
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:17,924
And you can trace historical narratives 
because we added me near that Yanis 

177
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,610
Varoufakis you couldn't have been 
clever.

178
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,320
He said one of the things he said,
well sure,

179
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,154
I liked it.
I've been saying it myself ever since 

180
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:26,240
then.

181
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,650
And sometimes I don't credit him with 
it.

182
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,150
There's no such thing as self.
He says you guys,

183
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:32,984
uh,
we exist in dialectic dialectically 

184
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,170
existing conversation with others.
In fact,

185
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:38,150
I think it's even in my standup now and 
I like it.

186
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,470
Yeah,
it's one is a good bit.

187
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,300
Like I talk about the notion of like,
you know,

188
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,260
how can you individually exist without 
relationship,

189
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,113
you know,
so like,

190
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,250
like any years actually Greek,
isn't it?

191
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,030
Yeah.
I found,

192
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,950
I was thinking about like,
you know,

193
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,080
like the tradition of democracy within 
reason come out of grace,

194
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:53,914
didn't it?
Because the thing I think about when he 

195
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:56,520
was talking about the itemized

196
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,610
and entrepreneurial society,
which fate,

197
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,640
individualism also had slavery in it.
That might be craft bloody lazy path.

198
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,853
Yeah.
We about two and a half thousand years 

199
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,340
ago.
So democracy.

200
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,420
Yeah,
still wasn't right.

201
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,200
It was a narrow as bullying number of 
men that could vote for that.

202
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,830
It was only 50 years at democracy.
It was,

203
00:09:14,831 --> 00:09:16,320
it was kind of a bit of a flash in the 
pan,

204
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,154
but the fact that it came to existence,
even for that narrow range of news was 

205
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,060
it was pretty extraordinary because 
think of that in these days though.

206
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,530
Fifty years you'd think when you're like
50 years ago now the sixties,

207
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,060
you're feeling like,
you know,

208
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:32,300
that's like the other people.
So like,

209
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,143
you know,
but like if something,

210
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,300
if we create some sort of utopia that 
lasted for 50 years,

211
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,223
it was a denim democratic utopia.
But regardless of what you're saying is 

212
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:41,430
that the crucible of individualism as we
regard it,

213
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,264
started there with this particular 
tradition that we can contrast to a 

214
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,953
different tradition and that to this day
you can see even in simple prosaic 

215
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,083
example such as a Selfie or people bug 
out of show off fish and also a major 

216
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:55,930
one.

217
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,450
So,
you know,

218
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,870
one of the,
this Guy Richard Nisbett,

219
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:00,730
who's the professor kind of studies this
as a pioneer of this guy,

220
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,260
said to me that,
um,

221
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,500
you know,
in China for example,

222
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:08,790
the idea of somebody suffering unfairly 
for the benefit of the group is far more

223
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,624
acceptable to them.
To us that's a horrific human rights 

224
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:11,994
abuse,
but it's much more acceptable in that 

225
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,300
culture because they privileged the 
group over the individual.

226
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,110
So there,
there are also bad effects.

227
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,980
So I'm not sample of someone's suffering
for the group.

228
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,500
Well,
so some of the human rights abuses that,

229
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:25,870
the communist dictator mind that,
well,

230
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,060
I mean,
so they don't mind it,

231
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:27,894
but,
but they're much more prepared to kind 

232
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:30,460
of tolerate abuse.

233
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,733
They privileged the group and you know,
I talked to a Japanese anthropology 

234
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,410
talks about,
you know,

235
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:38,244
the culture in Japan that a CEO of a 
company might commit suicide if they've 

236
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,234
let the company down and that might be 
seen as an honorable act in Japan still 

237
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:45,450
today.
Right?

238
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,740
Well,
at least he killed himself.

239
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,340
He did the right thing.
And that's almost a cliche though,

240
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:54,540
isn't it like a kamikaze idea.
And sort of slightly different,

241
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,180
I'm sure it's less prevalent today,
but you mentioned her,

242
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,223
she was saying that it's still secret,
still going to generally understood as 

243
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,330
to understand why you would do that.
And she had even in informal parties,

244
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,300
if she,
she,

245
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,133
she says,
you'll introduce yourself to somebody 

246
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:07,801
who's.
Hello,

247
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:08,940
I'm so nice,
David,

248
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,680
you'll,
you won't say I'm David.

249
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:13,550
And then it comes up in conversation a 
bit later on that you work for Sony.

250
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,071
You say,
hello,

251
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:14,904
I'm Sony's David.
So the idea of the group is much more 

252
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,413
front and center in their consciousness 
on David by either look at more new 

253
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:23,874
shoes.

254
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,590
You can always that shrimp salad.
Oh it's for everybody.

255
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:31,320
And we in the lot of way work for Sony.
That's why I'm here.

256
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,290
That's aristotle and yeah.
Yeah.

257
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,110
And then why would you identify with the
corporate entity?

258
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:37,944
So they say,
well you do think that capitalism does 

259
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:40,560
this.
Then it means that because everything is

260
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:43,860
stripped and made it into an economic 
model that people don't feel any sort of

261
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:44,694
sense of purpose or identification other
than their own individual sort of 

262
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,743
identification with themselves because 
communal values have been sort of 

263
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:53,620
radically and dramatically broken down 
over time to lose.

264
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:56,290
We think of ourselves as consumers.
That becomes our role.

265
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,940
Got No social order would.
That's the story that handily,

266
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,400
that Selfie,
it was absolutely so,

267
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,010
so,
so the,

268
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,843
so the beginning of the book,
we begin with how the ecology led to a 

269
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:07,850
certain way of being an introduce.

270
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,683
It's kind of the foundational idea with 
the book and that is that when we're 

271
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:12,154
born,
it's as if the brain asks at one 

272
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:14,620
fundamental question,
it says,

273
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:15,454
who do I have to be in this environment 
in order to get along and get headed in 

274
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:18,934
this tribe that I'm in and you know,
and there are sort of various 

275
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,990
interesting sort of neuro biological 
things that happen.

276
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,840
You know,
the brain kind of calms itself down as a

277
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,600
function called neural pruning.
We're actually carved itself down,

278
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:29,803
um,
to kind of meet the culture that it 

279
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,730
finds itself immersed in.
And you're right,

280
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:35,530
so,
you know,

281
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:38,230
during the middle part of the 20th 
century,

282
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:41,020
it was actually much more of a 
collective time in the West in both,

283
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:42,370
you know,
it was a time of welfare state.

284
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:46,450
It was a time of unionization.
It was a time of a regulation on banking

285
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:48,070
or businesses job for life.

286
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,770
And what sprang out of that environment 
where the hippies,

287
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,113
we had this very communalistic worldview
and if you compare who we were in 1965 

288
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,270
to who we became in 1995,
that's 20 years,

289
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:01,480
that's half a generation.
It's an absolute transformation in who,

290
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,673
who we are.
What happened right in the middle of 

291
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:04,924
those dates,
neoliberalism Thatcher and Reagan came 

292
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:07,450
along and said,
right,

293
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,283
forget all this collectivization.
I found this interview that you did in 

294
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:10,954
1981.
Really quite sinister where the stipend 

295
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:13,720
senator Tom said,
all right,

296
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,890
mom,
Margaret Thatcher,

297
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,880
you know,
what's your plans,

298
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:17,290
what are you going to do?
And she said,

299
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,960
Oh,
you know,

300
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,820
things made me kind of very cross about 
our policies for the last 30 years.

301
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,683
It'd been very collective and I want to 
sort of bring back individualism and 

302
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,690
that's a kind of.
I'm paraphrasing there,

303
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,960
but what then what you said is the 
object is sort of method is economics,

304
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,370
but the object is to change the soul.

305
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,530
She wanted sinister and it's especially 
because that's exactly what she did.

306
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,760
Couldn't both though the economics,
but the object is the truth.

307
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,160
That's exactly what she said,
Margaret.

308
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,650
I mean not actually as a person,
but it's a character that you don't just

309
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,610
look at people with detached from the 
actual reality of what they historically

310
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:52,444
did and just sort of think of him as a 
character because like Margaret 

311
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,543
Thatcher,
mum had said he had to write a poem 

312
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:59,950
about Alliance for state the windshield,
that de facto state funeral.

313
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,183
I'm like,
he said he looked at videos to inspire 

314
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:04,270
him and he said that when you watched it
you sort of think,

315
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,133
oh my God,
he's brilliant because he's so forceful 

316
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,773
and powerful and very opposite of the 
incipient managerial technocrats that 

317
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:11,644
find themselves in a position of 
government today with the notable 

318
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,400
notable exception of Donald trump.

319
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,240
But so like there was a clip that's 
very,

320
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:19,074
that is a curious observation that there
was a sort of an agenda to change the 

321
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:27,000
way the individual.
So that relationship with society out in

322
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,100
a central level.
Yeah.

323
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:28,540
And,
but I mean,

324
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,580
you know,
so obviously she had no understanding of

325
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:32,320
this rich and visit work because it 
hadn't happened yet,

326
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:33,970
but she was absolutely right in what she
did.

327
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:35,380
I mean,
and it happens really quickly.

328
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,393
So in 1992,
what you find is something really weird 

329
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:41,050
happening in our maternity wards.
So for generations,

330
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,580
parents called their children by Richard
Elizabeth Margaret,

331
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,433
like ordinary names.
And suddenly you get parents finding 

332
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:50,404
unusual and distinctive and kind of 
crazy names for their kids because they 

333
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:54,570
want their children.
Their words are,

334
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:57,740
the psychologists have found this out to
stand out and be a star is the beginning

335
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:00,560
of the keep fit revolution and then by 
the middle of the atheists we have the,

336
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,670
we have the Yuppies,
you know,

337
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:02,360
so,
so,

338
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,630
so,
so we start changing because who we have

339
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:06,464
to be in order to get along and get head
has been redefined by neoliberalism of 

340
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:09,944
course,
near near liberalism is this idea that 

341
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,060
they wanted to gamify all of human 
society,

342
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:18,260
the ones that are human life into a 
massive competition of self first itself

343
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,270
to get rid of the welfare state as much 
as possible.

344
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,133
Get rid of the unions,
get rid of all that red tape is they 

345
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:23,804
called it.
Everybody has to look after themselves 

346
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,220
and you know,
that's what we find today.

347
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,340
You know,
young,

348
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,120
young people are these very ancient 
Greek nodes of individual profit and all

349
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,240
their brands,
their entrepreneurial,

350
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,423
you know,
it's Kinda Thatcher's wet dream in a 

351
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,630
way.
Disturbingly,

352
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,523
that's kind of what we see today.
I'm just thinking about Margaret 

353
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,933
Thatcher having a way to it.
Thinking about the clammy of Maggie 

354
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,823
Smash.
Yeah.

355
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,920
And I like don't dislike the idea,
I'll be honest with you,

356
00:15:52,921 --> 00:15:54,480
will,
I'm enjoying it.

357
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,950
I may revisit that Meryl Streep film the
Iron Lady with this in mind.

358
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,590
She's dreaming of millennials.
That's who those are,

359
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:03,660
the people that are in that dream,
but do you.

360
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:03,961
Right?
So,

361
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:04,794
okay.
So you talked about the plasticity of 

362
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:06,414
the mind prune in itself to be opera 
bull in whatever context it finds 

363
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,450
herself in.
But if they're,

364
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:14,730
you know,
this is a 50 years be a sort of a period

365
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:15,564
of a democratic blip in ancient Greece 
or the journey from collectivism to 

366
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,853
massive individualism from the sixties 
to present day is a small period of 

367
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:23,910
time.
Excuse me,

368
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,773
from an evolutionary perspective.
So don't you reckon that is in right 

369
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,973
about really.
And we'll be able to turn people nicest 

370
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,230
pie

371
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,750
shake of title.
Well I think there are,

372
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,320
there are causes for optimism.
So in the book or you know,

373
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:39,420
I,
I write about sort of trump and brexit.

374
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:42,120
I know we don't think about those things
in terms of optimism usually,

375
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:45,300
but I'm in.
I kind of connect those with the rise of

376
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:49,250
Corbin because I think what we're seeing
is the beginnings of a mass rebellion.

377
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:49,760
Yeah.
Against

378
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,593
neoliberalism.
Could it be a handsome young Jeremy 

379
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,140
Corbyn yourself in that moment saying,
oh thank you.

380
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,040
I'll take that as a copay picture.
There'd be a video of asked.

381
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,380
See to see that.
Yeah.

382
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,510
Well there's a couple of minutes and it,
because,

383
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:04,490
well I started to like about Jeremy 
Corbyn was that it was still and sort of

384
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,324
like,
you know,

385
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,360
before all of the sort of hubbub of the 
laugh,

386
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,830
the election and they're,
you know,

387
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:12,170
their various leadership campaigns 
within the Labor Party.

388
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,183
There was an idea that it was a bit 
fuddy duddy and you can see that sharp 

389
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:18,380
and him up suit wise,
but like an hair cut by Zambia dwis.

390
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,273
But now I like is this sort of stillness
and when he's on things being sort of 

391
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:23,114
badgered and berated that he has a kind 
of like he's been through it so many 

392
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,150
times,
you know,

393
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,300
I,
I kinda like it.

394
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:30,940
And yes,
evidently it is what I felt like,

395
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,803
you know,
if there is a corollary between trump 

396
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,960
and corbin,
it's authenticity,

397
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,740
that these are both people that feel 
genuine and like there's an integrity.

398
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:41,210
We talked to Naomi Klein and she said,
yeah,

399
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:42,044
but Donald Trump's at massive liar,
but there's a brazenness to Donald 

400
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,960
Trump.
There's something brazen that like,

401
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,100
compared to the light,
the Hillary Clinton never all

402
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:50,963
crap politician he's going on about how 
about a bomber is the founder of Isis 

403
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,070
that's fairly brazen.
Wow.

404
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,980
This anything,
alright be prejudiced.

405
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:02,640
But,
but,

406
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,380
but I think what,
what,

407
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,213
what we,
what we forget to do sometimes in all 

408
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:08,670
our re outrage about Donald Trump is 
actually look at what he was saying.

409
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,920
So what he was saying during that 
campaign was,

410
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,773
I'm going to build a wall with Mexico 
and I'm going to make apple put a 

411
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:15,690
factory in Wisconsin and things like 
this.

412
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:17,430
And Steve Bannon,
his right hand man was going.

413
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,473
The problem is we've got it.
The middle class in America was built 

414
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:22,140
the middle class in Asia and you know,
that's true.

415
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,130
And so,
so,

416
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,770
so what he was mounting was an argument 
against globalization.

417
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,270
That's what,
that's what he campaigned on.

418
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,030
And of course globalization is the 
neoliberal projects.

419
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:30,864
What nearly was want is to create off 
the world one single perfect global 

420
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:34,770
market.

421
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,250
And if you're a right wing person with a
right ring brain and you are fed up with

422
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,103
neoliberalism,
that's going to be what you're thinking 

423
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:42,750
about is globalization is immigrants.
It's,

424
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,613
you know,
all these foreigners coming in here and 

425
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:48,360
knocking our wages down.
But if you're a left wing person looking

426
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,194
at exactly the same problem,
you're going to be looking in a 

427
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,680
different direction.
You're gonna be looking at regulation.

428
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:55,320
We need more regulation.
We need to cut this inequality.

429
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:57,180
We need to sort out these terrible house
prices.

430
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,820
We need to cut student debt.
So,

431
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,510
so it feels to me like these sort of 
these big political earthquakes,

432
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,463
a terrible cliche that have happened,
are both responses to the same problem 

433
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,200
just but from opposite ends of the 
political spectrum.

434
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,800
There are our responses against 
neoliberalism.

435
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,540
So I really do feel that this is the 
beginning,

436
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,670
the kind of the tumultuous beginning of 
a big period of world revolution in,

437
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,940
in our lifetimes.

438
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,973
The worrying thing is that because 
there's such different worldviews 

439
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,490
attacking the same problem,
it's going to be a period of conflict.

440
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,413
I think new worldviews are going to 
emerge because I would like to defy 

441
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:32,820
those taxonomies and systems of 
categorization.

442
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,663
This is what I think could,
could occur because information can be 

443
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,960
liberated so rapidly now.
I think it's possible.

444
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,620
Will that tells me a little bit for.
Go on one of my rant.

445
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,080
It looks a little bit about what you're 
saying about like,

446
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:46,914
uh,
the bogus self esteem revolution and 

447
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:50,004
it's reappropriation of sort of 
religious and spiritual principles to 

448
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,690
tell me what you mean.
So the heart,

449
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:56,110
the heart of Selfie.
I did a big,

450
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,053
big,
long investigation into the self esteem 

451
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:01,440
movement because this is what was the 
self esteem and movement.

452
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:02,131
What is it?
Well,

453
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:02,964
it says this idea engine,
it comes out of the human potential 

454
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,410
movement of the sixties and seventies in
America.

455
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,480
So in all that,
uh,

456
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,730
s comes out of it,
so it actually begins.

457
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,583
Excellent.
This'll institute in big Sur in 

458
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:16,560
California where I actually went in 
there actually.

459
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,640
Yeah.
I went there for the book.

460
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:19,200
I just,
I go and do a big sort of.

461
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,850
What did you do?
A course?

462
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:21,684
Did you ever do a work?
She's in a really nice hotel down the 

463
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:25,120
road,
call me.

464
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,003
There's this thing down there and I 
remember seeing her and Adam Curtis 

465
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:28,524
documented truffle archival look at him.
I went there to have a look at them and 

466
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,790
they were,
they weren't doing anything else.

467
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,980
It was,
you know,

468
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,590
they have that yoga workshops without.
I did what this course called the Max,

469
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:41,850
which was this horrific kind of thing 
about finding your authenticity,

470
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:42,684
but it's very similar to the workshops 
they were doing in the sixties and 

471
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:46,014
seventies a bit,
but it was all business ideas of human 

472
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,164
potential.

473
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,483
What was going on in the sixties and 
seventies when it was being in the 

474
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,360
screaming at your own genitals.
Yeah.

475
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:56,194
Yeah.
So I tell these horrific Thursday note 

476
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:59,470
for me,
Dylan,

477
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,563
they called them encounter groups.
So the I say so it's like imagine sort 

478
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:03,940
of big brother,
but,

479
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,490
but,
but,

480
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,400
but,
but much more intense,

481
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,383
you'd be shot in a room for hours and 
hours and hours name with complete 

482
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:12,760
strangers and your job is to be as 
honest as possible to that stranger.

483
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,040
Well,
people had nervous breakdowns,

484
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:15,874
you know,
nervous breakdown when you sit down 

485
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:17,464
nearly at one,
because if I start saying little things 

486
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:19,354
going in my head,
I'd be locked up because it's too much 

487
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:21,630
going on in there.
But.

488
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,980
But the but the reason they thought that
was a good idea,

489
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,863
it's important when stands because there
was this big revolution in America 

490
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,770
thinking.
So for generations back through Freud,

491
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,660
Freud,
back through all of Christianity,

492
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,930
the idea of what a human being is,
a human being is bad.

493
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,090
There's original sin,
there's Eda was complex,

494
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:39,520
we are bad.
And then in poster America,

495
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:42,460
this guy called Carl Rogers comes along 
and has this new idea.

496
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:43,570
He says,
actually,

497
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:44,380
no,
that's wrong.

498
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,750
Human beings are amazing.
They're fantastic.

499
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:49,960
They're full of latent potential and 
what we need to do to.

500
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,490
Well,
you just turns out of nowhere,

501
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,000
a few minutes of brilliant where he was 
extremely influential,

502
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,863
uh,
you know,

503
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,663
whereas you getting a bloody sort of 
backbone from how come you can come out 

504
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:03,890
with such a contrary point and everyone 
goes,

505
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,180
no trouble as well,
always said was he got,

506
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,721
well,
again,

507
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:09,730
I think it comes out of the economy.
So,

508
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,440
you know,
so in postwar America,

509
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:16,000
the economy was changing mat massively.
So there was a big exodus of people from

510
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,180
the country into cities,
uh,

511
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,430
women were now in the work,
in the workforce,

512
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:22,840
much more following the second world 
war.

513
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,530
So it was the era of Corp Man of 
suburbia or revolutionary road.

514
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,680
So it's a much more optimistic 
personality focused time.

515
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,540
So again,
it's,

516
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,373
it's always economy that underpins these
big changes in it and the big social 

517
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:35,494
movements.
And it seems to me that the reason that 

518
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:37,144
that may have had sort of tacit 
relevancy because both the projects of 

519
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:40,084
urbanization,
corporatization and mass 

520
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:43,660
industrialization,
they're all turning people into a bloody

521
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:44,494
great big lump.
And so you need an accompanying myth of 

522
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:50,770
individualism as a sort of tonic so that
you can get through your job.

523
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:53,500
Were you doing bugger all in your 
individualism is reduced to me.

524
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll buy this phone if you want,
without laughing.

525
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,863
Which I think the historical kind of 
traditional historical theory about how 

526
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:02,560
the world changes is a bit wrong for 
exactly those reasons is,

527
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,250
is that they tell that crazy story of 
somebody comes along with a new idea and

528
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,240
everybody's fluxing goes,
yeah,

529
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:08,170
that's a great new idea.

530
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,200
That's not how it works.
People have new ideas all the time,

531
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:12,034
but what we choose the person who has 
the idea that feels right and it feels 

532
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:16,900
right because our economy is in a 
certain way.

533
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,800
So it's,
it's,

534
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,633
it's the environment that changes first 
and then we kind of lock onto somebody 

535
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,440
who has an idea that feels kind of 
truthy.

536
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,380
So this was Carl Rogers and anyway,
so he,

537
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,250
he,
he was,

538
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,253
he,
he was just like this guy that kind of 

539
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,290
had this new idea that.
And that's why encounter groups came.

540
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,173
He pioneered encounter groups.
This idea that in order to become 

541
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:37,150
perfect,
we had to kind of,

542
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,073
you know,
reach this kind of inner core or as 

543
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:41,890
perfect as possible,
as perfect as are potentially artists to

544
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:44,490
be.
And so from a selling something in that,

545
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,670
that there will like,
you know,

546
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,613
like going on a journey of self 
discovery and honesty would be useful 

547
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,130
for an individual.

548
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,671
Yeah.
But,

549
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:53,091
but,
but,

550
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:54,410
but,
but there's a couple of problems with it

551
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:55,850
and one of them is the is the,
you know,

552
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:00,980
what is the authentic self is this idea 
that if we just strip away or the,

553
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,890
or the planet has a nice.
It is,

554
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,150
um,
uh,

555
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:09,290
the society layers upon us that there is
this perfect in a cell that we know that

556
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:13,670
isn't true in a sense.
You know,

557
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,710
that there is no such thing as the 
authentic self with the,

558
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,280
with the big caveat that we do have a 
distinct personality,

559
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,950
a biogenic kind of personality.
But so,

560
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,550
so,
so,

561
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,383
so,
so how did these ideas come to the self 

562
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:25,300
esteem movement of the Nineteen 80 
[inaudible]?

563
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,570
So John Vasconcellos was this very 
powerful California politician who,

564
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,760
uh,
who knew Carl Rogers and corrosion,

565
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:35,210
it's got sort of mentor to him and in 
the eighties and the,

566
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:36,044
in the neoliberal is he,
he had kind of a kind of near liberal 

567
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,280
kind of remix of these excellent ideas.

568
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,090
So he decided that he called self esteem
is social vaccine.

569
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,330
He literally thought it was this 
medicine that we'd all take self esteem,

570
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,940
the self esteem medicine,
uh,

571
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:54,050
and cocaine stay medicine.
Oh my God,

572
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,250
I know,
but that you'd done your job.

573
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:57,140
But that's what he thought.
He,

574
00:24:57,141 --> 00:24:59,780
he thought the self esteem was going to 
cure homelessness,

575
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,910
domestic violence,
uh,

576
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,220
in a teenage pregnancy,
drug abuse,

577
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,080
everything.
And not only that,

578
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:06,914
he thought it was going to make us more 
competitive contestants in this great 

579
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:10,760
near liberal game.
So he,

580
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:11,480
he,
he,

581
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,540
he was the second most powerful 
politician in California.

582
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,080
And he proposed,
he sets up this three year task force to

583
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,270
investigate self esteem.
And he said,

584
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,800
I'm going to get these,
these scientists to,

585
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,380
to,
to,

586
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,030
to prove that there was a causative link
here,

587
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:28,940
that if we give people high self esteem,
they will become more perfect.

588
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,480
That become better near liberal kind of 
contestants in how happier and healthier

589
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,820
so.
So fast forward three years he tells the

590
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:35,540
world,
I've done it.

591
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,690
The scientists agree with me,
self esteem as a social vaccine.

592
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,640
That is an amazing transformation.
At the beginning.

593
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:42,530
Everyone's laughing at this idiot from 
California,

594
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:43,364
like this joke.
He's literally a national direct Johnny 

595
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,810
Carson's cracking jokes about this thing
on the tonight show.

596
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,660
You know,
he's,

597
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,880
he,
he's a laughing stock,

598
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,070
but then it comes out with his news.
I've done it.

599
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,173
I've got these seven University of 
California professors to study the data 

600
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,710
and they've backed me up.
Self esteem is a social vaccine and he's

601
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:01,780
everywhere.
Then he's big.

602
00:26:01,781 --> 00:26:02,614
He's flown to the Soviet Union,
has talked to the communists about self 

603
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:06,980
esteem is an oprah talking about self 
esteem.

604
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:07,814
And then of course I'll protect,
gets hold of the idea and it goes 

605
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:12,470
everywhere.
He becomes this kind of celebrity.

606
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,380
And the idea that goes around the world 
and it changes everything.

607
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:17,030
It changes the way we raised our 
children.

608
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,680
It changes the way we teach our 
children.

609
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:20,900
It's that whole era,
which I think we both grew up in.

610
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:23,120
All of your wonderful.
You're special,

611
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:23,954
you're amazing.
Have a Rosetta for coming 14th place in 

612
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:28,034
the sports day.
And what you see in the psychological 

613
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:34,210
data is from the 19 no,
you.

614
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,890
Narcissism starts going up.
So.

615
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,860
So we start raising,
raising a generation of children who are

616
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,630
more narcissistic year by year,
and then the,

617
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,910
the kind of cohort that came before 
them.

618
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,680
And of course that's the selfie 
generation.

619
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,693
These are the millennials.
And so what I do in the book is I go 

620
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:50,814
back to.
I spent a year investigating John 

621
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,273
Vasconcellos.
He's since died and his taskforce and 

622
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,980
what do you mean investigator down 
taskforce members I went to.

623
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,030
There's a big archive in Sacramento,
the selfish all their documents.

624
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,223
I've got all their documents.
I've got audio recordings of their 

625
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,020
meeting.
Was it.

626
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,570
It was amazing because what some people 
knew was that there was a,

627
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,620
there was a problem.
That data didn't kind of say what Fastco

628
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,220
Fast Evan Got Invesco Oakland,
Vasco,

629
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,060
what?
Vasco said it said,

630
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,780
but I tracked down one task force member
who described the whole operation in his

631
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:23,940
words is a fucking lie,
and he said,

632
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,643
he said,
he said I was in a room with it and now 

633
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,633
he's.
I was in a room with vascular when he 

634
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,114
saw the scientific reports for the first
time and he said if the legislature who 

635
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,913
fund them,
if ledger to see what's in the reports 

636
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:38,670
are going to shut our task force down 
and he said from that moment on,

637
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:39,504
the whole thing got covered up.
So it's incredibly consequential 

638
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,683
exercise and changing who we are,
which really did have a big impact on 

639
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:48,550
who we are today was,
as I kind of sort of revealed itself.

640
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,383
He really was based on a massive delinah
deliberate coverup and I even tracked 

641
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:55,710
down if I've got Andrew Mecca who was 
his right hand man,

642
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:57,340
who cheerfully admitted to me when 
interviewed him.

643
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,320
Yeah,
we covered it up.

644
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,550
Yeah,
we covered it up.

645
00:27:59,551 --> 00:27:59,941
We,
you know,

646
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:00,311
we,
we,

647
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:03,600
we deliberately went out on a mission to
kind of spin our way out of this problem

648
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,703
that the scientists were saying that 
there is no causative link between self 

649
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:07,914
esteem and all these virtuous,
amazing results with my dancing 

650
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,240
research.
Your ideas crap.

651
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,500
Yeah.
I mean I actually,

652
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:21,210
I actually found a tape recording of the
meeting at which the lead scientist,

653
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:25,860
a guy who's a sociologist called Dr Neil
smelser.

654
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,250
I actually found an audio recording of 
the meeting in which he announced to the

655
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:30,084
group what the results were and he was 
basically saying is we're not getting 

656
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,590
what you want us to get it,
you know,

657
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,470
where we are seeing a link between self 
esteem and good outcomes.

658
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,780
We're not sure if it's causative or not.
So what he's saying is,

659
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,250
for example,
in education,

660
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,084
you can see that people who have high 
good exam results have better self 

661
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:48,684
esteem.
So what Vasco thought was that the self 

662
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,200
esteem was causing the good exam 
results,

663
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,630
but actually what's causing the service 
day.

664
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:55,920
Exactly.
Exactly.

665
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:57,000
So,
so yeah,

666
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:00,630
and then I found another tape from a 
couple of months later we were people,

667
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:03,480
including this guy I interviewed with 
getting blowjobs all day.

668
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,580
Good self esteem.
I founded say with this meeting,

669
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,540
I just want to suck letter steam right 
out of their belly pipe.

670
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,020
Sorry about that.
So stuff that I've always found amazing,

671
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,903
uh,
of this kind of rebellion that happened 

672
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:19,524
at this meeting,
including the guy that I tracked down 

673
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:21,294
where they stood up and said,
I'm really uncomfortable with what 

674
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:23,934
you're saying to the media because we're
saying that we found this link and we 

675
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:27,990
haven't got this link.

676
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,380
So come on,
shut up.

677
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,733
It was just sort of get stuff done like 
that because I would have fought self 

678
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:38,094
esteem is a good thing.
Well there's healthy self esteem is a 

679
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:41,394
good thing.
So there's a guy called Professor Roy 

680
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,773
Baumeister,
who I also tracked down who was the 

681
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:48,310
guide that kind of busted this if we 
didn't much to track it down.

682
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:51,550
I just found his email and emailed him.
But he said there is such a thing as off

683
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:54,600
the bat side,
looking at pebbles tweaks,

684
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,030
bloke to get like an aboriginal tracker 
to find him.

685
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,770
But now he of course he said there is 
such a thing as healthy 70,

686
00:30:00,771 --> 00:30:02,380
but if it is earned.
So you know,

687
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:03,214
Einstein had really good self esteem 
will probably we guess Bhava dressing 

688
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,930
up.
Did he say that to staff?

689
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,310
That pair of trousers twice.
Banks out there.

690
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,010
I'm to do some maths and that's 
Einstein.

691
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:15,843
Everyone.
But it also is an interesting guy 

692
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:18,814
because his father was a literal Nazis.
Father fought with a narcissist and 

693
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,870
Second World War and as Roy Baumeister 
said,

694
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,913
Hitler had high self esteem too and it 
would appear certainly believed in many 

695
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:30,460
of these ideas.
Yeah,

696
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,730
absolutely.
Mystery.

697
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,550
He's a mystery because I think he might 
have been a bit down on himself at times

698
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:38,850
when he was on his own and felt terrible
will.

699
00:30:38,851 --> 00:30:40,830
That's the self esteem,
the self esteem.

700
00:30:40,831 --> 00:30:41,664
If that says,
says that all kinds of bad antisocial 

701
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:47,140
behaviors are because it's deep down,
you don't love yourself about you.

702
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:49,390
Then what got you off on this mission?
Well,

703
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,313
because that was,
that was the kind of the story of my 

704
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,130
early life,
so I was an idiot growing up.

705
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,620
Like I failed all my exams.
I didn't concentrate at school,

706
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,930
got in trouble with the police.
I was alcoholic,

707
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,943
drug abuse,
like the whole staff and through my 

708
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,543
twenties I was in therapy,
flop my twitter is trying to sort my 

709
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:06,004
head out and the constant refrain from 
teachers at school from the counselors 

710
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:10,714
was always,
you've got low self esteem and your 

711
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:12,610
parents didn't love you.

712
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,260
I'd very victorian,
you know,

713
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,700
classic English parents,
didn't,

714
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,563
they never liked,
loved you enough and that's why you're 

715
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:20,170
so unhappy.
And I completely bought this.

716
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:21,004
I completely believe this.
And I bought this idea that my problem 

717
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:24,394
deep down was that I didn't love myself.
I had low self esteem and that what I 

718
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:29,380
had to do to cure it was to get high 
self esteem.

719
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,450
So I did all these things to get high 
self esteem.

720
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:34,450
And then I spoke to this.
Roy baumeister found out that it was all

721
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:36,760
a myth and it was only like six years 
ago and it was like,

722
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,803
oh hang on.
So you're saying that everything I 

723
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:39,364
thought was true about myself,
this whole journey I've been on of self 

724
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:42,724
improvement has been based on bullshit 
and it was based on the language may be 

725
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:50,560
um,
sort of bogus,

726
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:51,394
but what ultimately aren't we all 
looking for some sort of form of what I 

727
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,110
want to say connection.

728
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,810
It's not like you want to go round,
rambled puffed up on a theme or mad like

729
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:01,420
a bull frog snack or high as a kite on 
silliness,

730
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,060
but you don't want to feel terrible 
feelings of worthlessness.

731
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:08,440
And one could imagine that a childhood 
that didn't have physical affection and,

732
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,513
and I don't know,
validation in it might lead someone to 

733
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:12,940
not feel.
Yes.

734
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,240
Well I think,
I think there was a,

735
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,920
there is an element of truth in that.
So,

736
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:16,763
so where the book ends up is,
is with this idea of what is the self 

737
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,073
and there is a quarter,
everybody's sense of self and that's a 

738
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:22,834
lot of that story is genetic.
So a lot of who we are used is down to 

739
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,420
just an accident of genes.
And so what I,

740
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,323
when I do my personality test,
what I am is I'm high in the trait of 

741
00:32:31,631 --> 00:32:32,464
neuroticism.

742
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,800
Neuroticism goes hand in hand with low 
self esteem.

743
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:38,350
So if you suffer from low self esteem,
you're generally a high neurotic.

744
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,520
But because it's a relatively stable 
personality trait,

745
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:42,410
it means that you can't actually do much
about it.

746
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,400
But you're right to say I was born with 
a neurotic brain.

747
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,443
If I'd have had more loving parents,
I would have been brought up happier 

748
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,700
but,
but this combination of a neurotic brain

749
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,740
and on parents that weren't very 
affectionate isn't a nasty combination.

750
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,480
So they did have.
But.

751
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,570
But the thing is,
the point is you can't do anything about

752
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:04,340
it once you're in.
You're a pretty neurotic brain.

753
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:05,000
And Mum,
mum,

754
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,270
she couldn't have given me more 
smothering theater.

755
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,920
Our mom,
she loved the hell out of there.

756
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:10,754
Oh Russ.
But you're very confident there's the 

757
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:13,763
result.
So you can live a terrible drug addict 

758
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,833
and an alcoholic and written with self 
doubt and all that kind of stuff and 

759
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,063
sort of fast moving mind that for 
forever looking for something that 

760
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,930
probably isn't even there,
but don't you think like that?

761
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,773
The isn't the,
some of the ideas I'm interested in 

762
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:31,190
here,
we'll is that wherever,

763
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,710
you know,
wherever it's a biomechanical model that

764
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:37,430
we prefer over some kind of Mumbo jumbo 
spiritual model.

765
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:42,431
Liberty essential self is interconnected
and they all sorts of important to me is

766
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:47,681
the possibility and potentiality for 
change both on an individual level,

767
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,960
in a social,
cultural level.

768
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,853
I believe in change very much because I 
was a drug addict and now one day at a 

769
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:56,300
time,
no drugs,

770
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,070
different behaviors.
It depends.

771
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:02,210
It depends what you mean by change.
So of course if we can heal,

772
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,560
right?
So of course we can heal.

773
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:04,394
So I'm much happier now as a 40 year old
then I wants us a 22 year olds fucking 

774
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:08,600
miserable.
It's 22 year olds.

775
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,170
But I'm much happier now,
you know,

776
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,180
because I have a good,
uh,

777
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,053
a wife that,
that helps me when I'm going a bit mad 

778
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:15,560
and things like this.

779
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,393
So of course we can heal and you've 
obviously been on a big journey of 

780
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:20,330
healing,
but we can't do it is.

781
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,870
So the whole human potential idea that 
we still have very much with us today is

782
00:34:23,871 --> 00:34:24,704
this toxic lie which tells our young 
people you can do anything you want to 

783
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:29,174
do and be anything you want to be.
You just have to dream big and kind of 

784
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,010
go for it.
And that's very inspirational.

785
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,933
But it's also very,
very dangerous because what it does is 

786
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:40,070
it tells people that when they fail,
which most of us do,

787
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,800
it's their fault and that's part of the 
individuals and thing.

788
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:43,763
We forget that the reasons that we fail 
our many and myriad and lots of the 

789
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:49,070
marina and brought in our environment,
we blame ourselves.

790
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:49,904
So the book actually begins with talking
about suicide and the regions that we 

791
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:53,090
kill ourselves.

792
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,163
And you know,
that sort of the model of pathway into 

793
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,253
suicide is one that says that.
We said overly high expectations for 

794
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:02,930
ourselves and when we fail again and 
again and again and again,

795
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:06,360
and we feel stuck in that failure,
that's when the cell starts to become in

796
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:10,130
a really dangerous place to combat that 
particular issue.

797
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:10,964
Then I think the big societal way is we 
need to stop telling this lie that you 

798
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:16,460
can do anything you want to do and be 
anything you want to do.

799
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:17,294
We cannot transform my personality.
We cannot be beyonce or Michael Jordan 

800
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:22,720
because we decide that that's what we 
want to do.

801
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:23,554
You know,
we have,

802
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,620
we are,
we are animals.

803
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:25,454
We are biologically limited and there's 
nothing we can do about that other than 

804
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,920
Michael Jordan is Michael Jordan and 
beyonce is beyonce.

805
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,510
Yeah.
So they,

806
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:35,450
they have a particular biology which 
enables to that particular acculturation

807
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,600
say in,
on saying it,

808
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:38,290
bulks and teller.

809
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,190
She's crap for the first eight years of 
her life.

810
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:43,170
She's not that well.
That might make her better.

811
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,550
She must be bloody.
Absolutely.

812
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:46,260
I know I'm going to do an even better 
record,

813
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,490
but why is it.
But like,

814
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:52,050
but like I look,
I understand that this idea of um,

815
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,213
happiness through sort of self 
fulfillment in a very materialistic way 

816
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,203
was always just a marketing idea.
But when you sort of think of the vivid 

817
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:05,301
images of Coca Cola and apple and these 
sort of glorifications of the self,

818
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,931
you know,
these ideas,

819
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,070
if you can do what you want,
you know,

820
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,660
like is that,
that idea,

821
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:10,494
I think he's merely suggested so that 
you can fulfill it with a can of coca 

822
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:17,781
cola or a new iphone.
But the idea of change and potentiality,

823
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,210
I think that this I think is very,
very important to people.

824
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,800
But I suppose where it goes wrong 
perhaps is when it,

825
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,703
when there's a preordained idea of what 
it is you're meant to be in order to be 

826
00:36:28,831 --> 00:36:29,100
happy.

827
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,390
Now,
speaking from personal experience,

828
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:31,224
I fought,
I've got loads of money and I'm famous 

829
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,790
and have sex with every one.
That'd be great.

830
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,713
So I tried those things and there were 
bits of it that were sensually 

831
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,540
brilliant,
an egotistically rewarding.

832
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:46,260
But I found them all to be ultimately 
our ultimately unfulfilling.

833
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:47,870
And now my life is based on,
you know,

834
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:51,290
admittedly we've economic comfort,
like I'm living in a degree,

835
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,610
I don't have to go out and do terrible 
things to get money,

836
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,420
but like at all,
so like,

837
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,280
but like uh,
you know,

838
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,133
but I do,
but I'm living in a kind of an ordinary 

839
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:03,320
domestic sort of life or partner have 
trialed pets,

840
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,280
you know what I mean?
I'm not a headedness anymore.

841
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:06,114
I'm not living in a decadent life 
because I think I was trying to live in 

842
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:10,860
accordance with a myth that was untrue.

843
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,933
So I completely agree with that.
But my concern would be if we're left 

844
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:15,744
with just a biomechanical model of this 
is your limitations as an animal and as 

845
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:23,550
an individual that people might settle 
for a life that's fulfilling.

846
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,810
Yep.
So,

847
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,780
so yeah,
so there's a nuance here.

848
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:28,614
So I don't want to come,
come across like I'm attacking 

849
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:31,524
individualism completely isn't,
it's not a sort of big polemic because 

850
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:35,094
what you have to do as well,
sort of being a grown up is take a step 

851
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:39,940
back and go actually individually,
ms dot pretty amazing as well.

852
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:41,790
Like what we've achieved in the western 
two and a half thousand years.

853
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,720
It's pretty amazing.
We've done some pretty amazing stuff and

854
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:48,060
some bad stuff like technology in that 
we look at New York,

855
00:37:48,061 --> 00:37:50,100
we built New Orleans.
Yeah.

856
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,373
And a part of that is individually.
Apart from that is that we tell people 

857
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:55,770
you can do anything you want to do,
he should shoot for the stars,

858
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,910
but we also have a full idea of what a 
human being is in our culture today.

859
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,740
We,
especially on the left,

860
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:02,574
you know,
we like to believe that the human brain 

861
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:07,890
is a blank slate and that we are all 
born in a place of equal,

862
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:10,020
amazing potential.
And that isn't true.

863
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:10,854
We all have,
we're all biological limited in 

864
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:13,980
different ways.
So we all have different talents,

865
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:16,100
different abilities.
And there's a guy called Brian little,

866
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:16,934
I speak to who,
who's an expert in this kind of 

867
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:21,300
personality stuff.
He talks a lot about the damage the Self

868
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,180
Esteem Myth has wrought upon our people 
and you know,

869
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:25,014
and he says that we need to give people 
kind of equals and personal projects 

870
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,133
over which,
which gives them meaning but over which 

871
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:32,370
they have efficacy I ever wished,
which they,

872
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,263
you know,
there's no point in trying to be the 

873
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:37,840
fastest man in the world if you are 86 
and have one leg,

874
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:38,370
you know,
like we,

875
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,780
we,
we have to understand that,

876
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,013
know that the capabilities of our 
children and encourage them in those 

877
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:45,220
specific directions and not say,
yeah,

878
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:46,090
you can be beyonce.

879
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,470
Just dream big.
Yeah.

880
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:48,304
These values and ideals are probably 
sort of erroneous and that sort of 

881
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:53,440
established by capitalist consumer 
template.

882
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:58,441
These other constellation is populated 
body idols and icons of the capitalists.

883
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,960
Skyscape absolutely right.
It's the economy.

884
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:03,160
So at the beginning of our chat and I 
talked about who is this?

885
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,910
Who is this hero is surrounded by this 
22 year old thin stomach,

886
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,560
big boobed globally minded.
Entrepreneurial.

887
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,710
Yeah.
Because it's a budget.

888
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,400
I didn't know who.
Who is this person with?

889
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:19,040
This person is the hero of our culture,
so we live in a near liberal culture,

890
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,640
neoliberal environment,
and this is the hero of neoliberalism.

891
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:24,010
This is the person who is most,
um,

892
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,113
uh,
cut out best to survive and thrive in 

893
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:27,754
the neoliberal environment.
So this is the person I culture is 

894
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:30,184
trying to try,
trying to attempt us into becoming a 

895
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,380
facsimile low.

896
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,510
He's not a real,
he's a,

897
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,743
he's a myth,
but actually it's sort of probably old 

898
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,074
white blokes pottery masturbating over 
the image you just described because 

899
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,530
that person doesn't exist.
It's a cipher,

900
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,503
not a cultural myth is a cultural 
construct and we're all tormented by it 

901
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:52,150
to a certain extent.
You know,

902
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,013
we all want to be this person.
And of course as we get older and 

903
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:55,920
fatter,
we,

904
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,980
we become less and less to that person.
And as you know,

905
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,050
and,
and that's why,

906
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,003
you know,
one of the most vulnerable groups for 

907
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:02,760
suicide are middle aged men.
Because you know when,

908
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,070
when you hit your forties and fifties,
you've come up against these limitations

909
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:06,904
very much and you begin to realize,
I'm never going to be that person that 

910
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:10,234
I've,
I've always been told that I ought to 

911
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:11,631
be.
Yes,

912
00:40:11,631 --> 00:40:13,750
that's right.
And your physical gestures,

913
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:15,770
you did that mate,
very close to the Nazi salute.

914
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:16,723
You as you gestured that the bloke was 
outside and a bath and they think it's 

915
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:20,974
because really where we should be 
looking for this kind of resolution is 

916
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,390
inward.
It's peaceful in our connection.

917
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:32,810
Like one of the repeated reframes that 
I'm banging on about if that,

918
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,653
that all of these things that like many 
of the discoveries that are made by the 

919
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,970
sort of world of neuroscience,
which I knew next to nothing about,

920
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:40,950
uh,
and uh,

921
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,783
like it was sort of in sociology and 
health and stuff I've already outlined 

922
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:47,134
in spiritual principles.
And as we discussed prior to us 

923
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:50,584
recording,
you know that many of the 

924
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:53,314
particularities and sociocultural 
aspects of religious doctrine that are 

925
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,010
particular to the time of its 
conception.

926
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:04,090
I can see that those observances ain't 
particularly helpful.

927
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,103
But the perennial ideas of oneness,
that of self is realized through 

928
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:11,554
communion with the whole fruit or 
acceptance that the material is 

929
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:18,580
transient and temporary lessons that 
I've learned in my own life.

930
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,090
I recognize we're already bloody written
down in old,

931
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:24,070
old 5,000
years old.

932
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,193
The ancient texts.
And when some Swami said to me in India 

933
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,103
like chillingly,
the material world has nothing else to 

934
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:32,291
give you.
Now,

935
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:34,070
Russell,
it can take from

936
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,200
you.
And it made my stomach turn over when he

937
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:38,900
said it,
I knew he was telling the truth.

938
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,800
I knew what he meant.
Stop looking for it in fame.

939
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:45,560
Stop looking for it in money.
And on a daily basis,

940
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:47,300
I forget.
I wake up and I think,

941
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:47,811
oh,
you know,

942
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:49,680
and that's why again,
in the,

943
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,773
in classical myths there is per permit 
us to go through the daily punishment 

944
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:55,874
because he stole the file.
Sufis who asked to continually push the 

945
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:04,001
rock up the hill because it's an ongoing
realization because the self is an event

946
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,383
rather than an object.
The self is the conscious awareness of 

947
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:08,954
our own experience,
which I think can be brought into 

948
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:12,404
alignment with a different kind of pace 
if we do reject that external matrix of 

949
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:19,220
ideas that were supposed to be heading 
towards,

950
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,293
but I wouldn't abandon the idea of a 
pursuit because I think that's how we 

951
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:27,320
can change the world with that energy

952
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,990
drive.
Yeah,

953
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,610
yeah,
yeah.

954
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,680
I think.
I think the one thing that individualism

955
00:42:32,681 --> 00:42:35,770
gets wrong is,
is it in over sin,

956
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,953
over emphasizing the individual is it 
turns it back turns its back on on the 

957
00:42:40,841 --> 00:42:43,450
fact that we are a tribal animal.
We are,

958
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,313
we are a connected species.
We spent over 90 percent of our time on 

959
00:42:46,391 --> 00:42:47,224
this earth as members of hunter gatherer
tribes of around 148 people for 

960
00:42:50,831 --> 00:42:51,664
thousands of years and years before 
thousands of thousand years before 

961
00:42:53,861 --> 00:42:54,694
civilization go.
And so how long did that go on hunter 

962
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,060
gathering?
Hundreds of thousands of years.

963
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:03,070
I mean the average that you tried to 
find that specific date for the book,

964
00:43:03,311 --> 00:43:04,144
but they're all wildly different.
So I ended up kind of fudging a little 

965
00:43:05,991 --> 00:43:07,030
bit.
Oh No,

966
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,163
hang on a minute.
We found a big tribal people cross that 

967
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,670
ice plateau.
They're always argued about that,

968
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:13,271
but we.
Yeah,

969
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:13,900
but we have,
you know,

970
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,360
we had these tribal brains and,
and,

971
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,330
and we,
as you say,

972
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:17,164
we,
we basically.

973
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,530
This is a blip the way you said that 50 
year democratic blip in ancient Greece.

974
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,041
Like,
Oh,

975
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:21,874
show.
I liked him,

976
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,760
but then I must band.
But he goes to site.

977
00:43:23,761 --> 00:43:26,190
It's just a clearing in the woods.
We talk about civilization,

978
00:43:26,191 --> 00:43:27,480
like it's some big deal.
He's like,

979
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,190
just for while the forest is cleared 
back.

980
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,053
Oh look,
we've got televisions and towers and 

981
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,790
then nature will reclaim it.
So for hundreds of thousands of years we

982
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:40,480
were quite happy with the berries in the
Huntington and the Shaman and now.

983
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,770
Yeah.
And of course I,

984
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,520
you know,
and so,

985
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:42,910
so,
so,

986
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:43,743
so,
so we kind of turn our back very much 

987
00:43:44,891 --> 00:43:45,310
on,
on,

988
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,143
on the kind of individual on the 
essential connect connected part of our 

989
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,510
humanity is,
as you say,

990
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,790
well it's not in the book.
That's when I was living in Australia.

991
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:57,850
I did a story on him place called 
Rookwood cemetery outside Sydney,

992
00:43:57,851 --> 00:43:59,820
and it's the biggest cemetery in the 
southern hemisphere,

993
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,840
so city of dead people and it's all and 
it's all a kind of cordoned off in terms

994
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:07,320
of the culture.

995
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,450
There's a Chinese cemetery in Islamic 
cemetery in all that stuff.

996
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:14,230
That's a bit of a downer.
You can't mix with the wrong group.

997
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,010
It's very tribal.
You barely meet with them lot,

998
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:17,973
but it's true.
You'll just be some mush as she is a 

999
00:44:20,081 --> 00:44:20,914
good point.
You know the,

1000
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,750
it goes back to our tribal cells.
We are tribal,

1001
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,070
you know,
even even in death,

1002
00:44:24,071 --> 00:44:24,904
we can't skip the tribe business,
but I asked the guy who kind of manages 

1003
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:27,993
imagery as a WHO's the worst.
He's the worst people for kind of 

1004
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,800
tending the grays coming back and said,
oh,

1005
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,620
Christians by far and away all the other
cultures,

1006
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:35,580
you know,
they keep coming back.

1007
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,421
You know,
they,

1008
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:36,780
they,
they,

1009
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,940
they polish the grave,
they bring gifts and flowers.

1010
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:39,774
You know,
some of the,

1011
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:40,973
some of the racist have like annual 
events where they come and have little 

1012
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:44,530
parties for the greatest westerns.

1013
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,383
They come once or twice and then they 
just discovered shit and that's 

1014
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:48,380
individualism,
you know,

1015
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,253
that's,
you know,

1016
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,540
even down to the kind of the unit of the
family,

1017
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:52,690
you know,
once they did all their debt,

1018
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,533
now they're irrelevant.
We much more me focused and I didn't 

1019
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:58,770
understand that at the time I thought,
why are we so bad?

1020
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:59,783
But now I get it.
It's because we're individualists 

1021
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:01,651
because.
Yeah,

1022
00:45:01,651 --> 00:45:02,490
right.
We don't have,

1023
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,550
we don't connect to the path with NCSL 
linear tradition.

1024
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:06,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

1025
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,400
And it's,
the family were not,

1026
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:10,350
were far less family minded than those 
other eastern cultures.

1027
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,280
And that Tuesday I miss you grabbed 
that.

1028
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:14,780
Where did they go?
Well,

1029
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,770
yeah,
that's a folder.

1030
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,063
Um,
say that when you were talking about 

1031
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:24,290
Confucius and like,
and,

1032
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:27,750
and like having a different relationship
with self and selfies.

1033
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,363
Is there anything in that stuff that can
be useful to us in a collective 

1034
00:45:34,171 --> 00:45:36,780
ideologies that we could somehow ransack
propagate?

1035
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:41,340
And I think one of the things that 
surprised you from my research was that,

1036
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:42,683
you know,
especially on if we always talk about 

1037
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:46,550
this kind of crazy myths they have,
that there was once a better time and it

1038
00:45:46,551 --> 00:45:47,384
was,
there was once a perfect English and 

1039
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,193
make America great again.
But actually there was a better time in 

1040
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:52,450
a way,
and I'm not saying she,

1041
00:45:52,451 --> 00:45:53,284
you back to that time because we can't 
know because it's kind of changed 

1042
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:56,850
because of time,
but,

1043
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:58,830
but,
but the time,

1044
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,753
I was surprised to see that the middle,
the middle 20th century was a time of 

1045
00:46:02,731 --> 00:46:04,860
much more quality of the code that some 
economists call the.

1046
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:05,694
It appeared,
they called it the great compression 

1047
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,580
causes compression between the,
the,

1048
00:46:09,581 --> 00:46:10,414
the,
the,

1049
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,833
of inequality.
There was much less inequality and that 

1050
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:15,870
was this era of regulation of high 
taxation,

1051
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,100
of unionization.

1052
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:21,660
But it was also before globalization.
So it was a kind of a simpler time.

1053
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,860
Um,
but,

1054
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,760
but what,
but what kind of knocked I think our,

1055
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,793
our,
our kind of individually selves into 

1056
00:46:27,991 --> 00:46:31,380
that era of more collectivization was 
disaster.

1057
00:46:31,381 --> 00:46:32,214
Unfortunately.
It was the great depression and it was 

1058
00:46:33,901 --> 00:46:34,734
the first and second world wars,
and in those periods of massive crisis 

1059
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,370
knocked us into going,
right?

1060
00:46:38,371 --> 00:46:39,600
We need to start looking after each 
other.

1061
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:43,710
We can't have a world of war and 
economic disaster and all that stuff.

1062
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:44,331
So,
uh,

1063
00:46:44,331 --> 00:46:45,164
that's the thing that worries me is that
it takes a bit of a disaster to kind of 

1064
00:46:47,581 --> 00:46:50,620
knock us into a collective reality.
Oh No,

1065
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:51,454
I'm inclined.
She'll tell you that what happens is we 

1066
00:46:53,161 --> 00:46:55,400
get shocked and terrified by sort of,
you know,

1067
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,560
shock doctrine and she's called it low.
Get all terrified.

1068
00:46:58,561 --> 00:47:01,960
And then you act on the basis of your 
individual interests.

1069
00:47:01,961 --> 00:47:04,600
And of course,
like it became clear and out.

1070
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:09,610
Adam Kay says that the myth of a time is
often contrary to its truth.

1071
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,140
So if we're told we're individuals or 
individuals or individuals,

1072
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,290
the reality is you are a blob of 
humanity.

1073
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,393
That's what said,
like,

1074
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,251
we're all like,
yeah,

1075
00:47:18,251 --> 00:47:19,084
why?
And about our bloody air cuts and 

1076
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,980
selfies and our converse trainers,
I've got these ones that are made out of

1077
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:26,130
nikes now.
Nikes,

1078
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:29,810
gorgeous box,
fresh going to die.

1079
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,233
Dying.

1080
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,620
So I've got bit that worries me.
Very bad.

1081
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,580
Imperfect I.
No,

1082
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,790
no,
I think about them sometimes,

1083
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:38,624
but it's actually basically I've just 
got two little worries on the end of my 

1084
00:47:40,581 --> 00:47:41,414
legs,
so I'm just thinking some get some 

1085
00:47:42,711 --> 00:47:47,711
bubble gum on that burger.
What if the beech root folds on the Isa?

1086
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,540
So we're thinking of ourselves as 
individuals,

1087
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:51,374
but really we're just being marketed at 
and we're fulfilling our NATO because 

1088
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,420
most people aren't going to be a 
beyonce,

1089
00:47:56,421 --> 00:47:58,040
but heroes,
we're not heroes.

1090
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,280
Icons of often functioned in that way 
now.

1091
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:03,170
Like you know,
you hold that aspirational object up and

1092
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,004
instead of being to express the essence 
of beyonce is a woman who can express 

1093
00:48:07,611 --> 00:48:10,790
her womanhood through creativity and 
potency,

1094
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:11,624
Feminine Goddess Energy.
But you'll settle for or I'll buy the 

1095
00:48:14,151 --> 00:48:14,984
same headphones.
Yeah,

1096
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:16,710
yeah,
absolutely.

1097
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:17,680
Yeah,
yeah,

1098
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:17,971
yeah,
yeah.

1099
00:48:17,971 --> 00:48:18,481
You will.
Yeah,

1100
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:19,291
that makes sense.
Of course,

1101
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:22,590
it's all that's used for marketing 
purposes and I think the other thing,

1102
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:27,060
the interesting thing to think about 
when all this is before any of this sort

1103
00:48:27,061 --> 00:48:31,230
of engine green stuff is all that tribal
stuff and the fact that the,

1104
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,870
that we are a particular kind of tribal 
species.

1105
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,611
Uh,
you know,

1106
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:35,444
we liked the chimps in that we're not 
only groupish that we attack other 

1107
00:48:37,891 --> 00:48:40,710
groups and you see that a lot on social 
media.

1108
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:45,740
So in human tribe as in the chimp drive,
the status is always changing.

1109
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:48,420
Who's at the top is always in kind of in
flux.

1110
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:49,254
It cook a chimp,
a troop leader will be up there for 45 

1111
00:48:50,701 --> 00:48:51,560
years.
So we,

1112
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,960
we are preoccupied with status and we 
see that kind of

1113
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,083
that was going on in the week.
We stray into anthropology a little bit 

1114
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:00,964
when we,
you and I talking because we are trying 

1115
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:03,310
to understand it in a central truth 
aren't.

1116
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:06,940
With that goes beyond the limited and 
limiting context of civilization,

1117
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:07,774
which is only a blip,
but saying the hunter gatherer tribes 

1118
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:10,953
would have been luckily little chimp 
society with your only chief for a 

1119
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:16,090
minute and then someone's trying to 
knock that off with a rock.

1120
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:17,620
We're in chimps.
It's four to five years,

1121
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,050
which is interesting because we see that
in electrocytes inhumans.

1122
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,370
Exactly.
It's exactly the same.

1123
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:25,990
I had the banana but,
but,

1124
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,030
but that's.
But that's going to have social media,

1125
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,871
isn't it with you like,
you know,

1126
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:31,390
we're constantly worried about how many 
likes we've got you.

1127
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,060
I'll relative status,
status updates and all this stuff.

1128
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,133
But the other thing is that is that is 
that we are aggressively tribal like 

1129
00:49:37,321 --> 00:49:38,130
that.
Like you know,

1130
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:39,040
our,
our relatives,

1131
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:41,230
the chimpanzees that we kind of attack 
these other groups.

1132
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:42,064
And that's.
I think that's another really sort of 

1133
00:49:42,341 --> 00:49:43,174
dangerous aspect of social media is it 
encourages these very ancient kind of 

1134
00:49:46,101 --> 00:49:50,110
tribal circuitry in us that when someone
breaks the codes of our Ingroup,

1135
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:51,243
we sort of go,
wants to go off and kind of tear their 

1136
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:56,320
limbs off in a sense them attack them.
But this is really ancient stuff.

1137
00:49:56,321 --> 00:49:59,140
This is really powerful tribal circuitry
in the,

1138
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,270
in the human self that thinks like,
you know,

1139
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:02,560
these,
these kind of twitter storms.

1140
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,000
Uh,
kind of feeding off.

1141
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:05,300
Tell us,
well,

1142
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,630
what happened to you when you were in 
Scottish modern history.

1143
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,300
Tell us what happened to you when you 
met a nice den.

1144
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,250
Would the villain.
Actually he was the tribal guy.

1145
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:17,640
So this is a really interesting guy 
called John Pridmore who,

1146
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,190
uh,
he,

1147
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,190
he,
uh,

1148
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,440
he's just a classic eastern gangster.
Love Him.

1149
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,603
Yeah.
He's a really interesting guy and he 

1150
00:50:27,411 --> 00:50:28,244
looks exactly like you spent lucky's 
about seven foot with big leather coat 

1151
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:31,664
on and bolt head.
And you sat there like with his fist 

1152
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:38,520
down fist or with a big watch down there
too,

1153
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,560
if you want him to,
like you'd call that a kettle kettle.

1154
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,950
Oh crikey.
But have a me baby.

1155
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:45,883
But he was living his life in that 
classic Wimpish tribridge way when he 

1156
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:48,920
was a gangster,
you know,

1157
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:51,330
he,
he was an enforcer for a drug for the,

1158
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:53,870
for the drug gang,
with the firm,

1159
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:59,010
the firms and forth.
Someone didn't pay their money.

1160
00:50:59,331 --> 00:51:00,980
I'd kick a rat in the shins.
Yeah.

1161
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:01,690
Well he met with him.

1162
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,980
Was it torture and beat people?
Yeah.

1163
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:04,331
Yeah.
So,

1164
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:09,331
so some things will be naughty,
but in a gentle words to describe stuff.

1165
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,830
Show up.
Yeah.

1166
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:15,030
Well no,
they never shoot us because if you,

1167
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,820
if you had to shoot it and then you went
into prison for longer.

1168
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:17,970
So he had a machete.
Yeah.

1169
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,560
He had a special.
His shirt.

1170
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,560
He had a.
He had a special,

1171
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:25,580
especially a bespoke leather coat that 
had a pocket for a Jif lemon bottle with

1172
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,090
acid in it.
Some sort of acid in it.

1173
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,933
Bleach.
It might have been to put in your eyes 

1174
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,360
and a machete and the other one we 
having pancakes,

1175
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,650
but then he had a massive nervous 
breakdown.

1176
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:39,420
It became Catholic faith.
He found the Lord today.

1177
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,520
Lord,
why was he important in your research?

1178
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:45,350
Because he was my example of the tribal 
self.

1179
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:46,184
So he,
he,

1180
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,001
he,
you know,

1181
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:47,550
he,
he's,

1182
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:48,290
he,
he's,

1183
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:53,030
he's gang was the tribe and they will go
to war with the opposing tribe,

1184
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:54,953
which was obviously the rifle drugs took
who were also trying to sell drugs in 

1185
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:59,360
these kind of west end clubs,
but also the,

1186
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,433
his nervous breakdown was really 
important as well because it tells us a 

1187
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:03,853
really important thing about the self 
and it's the idea of the self as a 

1188
00:52:06,531 --> 00:52:07,364
storyteller.

1189
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,413
So there's this really interesting idea 
from neuroscience about called 

1190
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:14,930
confabulation and it's this idea that we
all have this voice in our heads,

1191
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:18,210
this kind of internal model of this 
constantly writing all our events.

1192
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:18,721
Tea,
yeah,

1193
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:19,554
you know him.
So he's saying this is why you did what 

1194
00:52:20,691 --> 00:52:21,560
you did.
This is what you said,

1195
00:52:21,561 --> 00:52:24,230
that this is why you're a good guy.
This is what you should do next.

1196
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,500
But it has no access to the rest of our 
unconscious.

1197
00:52:27,501 --> 00:52:30,230
So it's essentially making it up.
It's just telling you this story.

1198
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,133
So,
so you have no access to the real 

1199
00:52:32,151 --> 00:52:33,590
reasons why you're doing what you're 
doing.

1200
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,633
So it's quite terrifying concept because
it's saying that we have no real idea 

1201
00:52:38,061 --> 00:52:39,430
why we do what we do,
what we feel,

1202
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,360
what we feel,
what we feel,

1203
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,373
but the only reason that we feel that we
have like we do is because his voice is 

1204
00:52:44,571 --> 00:52:46,730
telling us and it's just making stuff 
up.

1205
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:49,430
So when he had his nervous breakdown,
what happened was he,

1206
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:49,950
he,
he,

1207
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:52,760
he punched this guy and he thought he'd 
killed him and his boss,

1208
00:52:52,761 --> 00:52:54,410
but when you put over a couple of nights
off,

1209
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:56,330
John,
because otherwise you're going to get in

1210
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:57,980
prison.
So he went back to his flat,

1211
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,530
he started smoking a joint.
You put on some porn,

1212
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,070
and then the television started talking 
to him and saying listing all the things

1213
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:04,904
he'd done.
Now John was brought up in a Catholic 

1214
00:53:07,161 --> 00:53:09,840
household.
And so his confabulation immediately,

1215
00:53:09,841 --> 00:53:12,740
his explanation of music was where that 
voice is obviously the devil.

1216
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,830
And that means that he's telling me I'm 
going to go to hell.

1217
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:17,750
And that means that if I'm going to save
myself from hell,

1218
00:53:17,751 --> 00:53:19,730
I need to pray to God.
So he runs outside,

1219
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,180
falls to his knees naked.
Not Naked,

1220
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:24,330
unfortunately.
Um,

1221
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,303
but perhaps with boner he was watching 
porn and then and then and then he runs 

1222
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:32,570
and he runs to his mom's house.
He knocked on his mom's door,

1223
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,200
get rid of the erection,
finish this off,

1224
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:39,520
and his mom opens the door and he says,
what you're doing job,

1225
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,360
what you do in John.
He said,

1226
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:40,830
mom,
mom,

1227
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,180
something's amazing seminar.
And she said,

1228
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,870
what's that full week?
Just soak up.

1229
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:49,621
And he says,
mom,

1230
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:50,790
I've found God.
And she goes,

1231
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:52,200
at 2:00
in the morning.

1232
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,000
It was hilarious,
but that.

1233
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:58,950
But his confabulation was and saved him 
from madness was the.

1234
00:53:58,951 --> 00:54:00,270
Actually you've not had a nervous 
breakdown.

1235
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:01,104
You're having a psychotic incident,
which is what I believe happened to him 

1236
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:03,624
that night.
He,

1237
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,200
he,
you know,

1238
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:04,620
he,
he,

1239
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,453
he,
he took a story from his culture which 

1240
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:07,434
was a Catholic Christian story of what 
reality is and what our place in that 

1241
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:12,450
reality is.
And it kept us out.

1242
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:13,463
Just the secular narrative for what 
happens in the consciousness sounded 

1243
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,430
deck chairs on titanic time and it would
just sort of saying that's it.

1244
00:54:18,431 --> 00:54:20,760
That's one way of describing it.
Epiphany,

1245
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,020
the sudden revelation of essence or 
breakdown.

1246
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,820
I reckon in a little while ago I had one
of those things,

1247
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,773
but because my.
Because I like to think that my inner 

1248
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:31,020
critic now,
that Voice of confabulation,

1249
00:54:31,021 --> 00:54:31,854
I think I've given mine access to the 
deep deep codes that you're one like 

1250
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,870
that when you went through in that 
research and nodal those recording.

1251
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,840
So my inner voice now I think I trust 
that little guy also.

1252
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:41,280
Actually,
I don't entirely trust it.

1253
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,280
I always use other people's information 
and data.

1254
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,470
Like I go,
I'm thinking of doing this thing,

1255
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:47,700
and people go,
oh no,

1256
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,470
that's a terrible idea.
Don't do it.

1257
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,580
I've got older men further down the path
than me that it was sort of tell me no,

1258
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,960
no.
Russell was was a mental breakdown mate,

1259
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,160
but like my age,
it's very conventional.

1260
00:54:59,161 --> 00:55:02,250
I've understood that you sort of reboot,
but you question your identity and go,

1261
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:03,570
hold on a minute.
What the hell have I been doing?

1262
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:05,830
Like you just said about the suicide 
staff and like.

1263
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:08,160
So I think with your man there,
it feels like,

1264
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:08,681
you know.
Yeah.

1265
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:09,514
The interpretive tool was.
He had the vocabulary of Christianity 

1266
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:15,570
and we have the vocabulary of 
neuroscience,

1267
00:55:15,571 --> 00:55:19,500
but essentially there was one central 
event and that central event was,

1268
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:22,710
I want to break out of the preexisting 
narrative and anyway,

1269
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:26,250
it doesn't matter does it if you term it
as epiphany or breakdown as long as what

1270
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:27,084
happened subsequently as you stop being 
an eastern gangster guy around for Jif 

1271
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:31,980
lemon of acid and the machete and start 
being a monk,

1272
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:34,890
it sounds like a cool thing is,
is it's an excellent point because.

1273
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:35,820
Yes,
I agree with you.

1274
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:36,663
It was.
It was great that he didn't end up 

1275
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:38,363
medicated in a psychiatric institute as 
his Mother did at one point in his life 

1276
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:43,100
and it's also great that,
you know,

1277
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,840
goes around preaching the Gospel to 
younger children.

1278
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:49,110
I love a cockney because I was thinking 
just that bad cockney priest.

1279
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:52,110
I would love a cockney priest and this 
is got a cottony monkey.

1280
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:53,440
It was really easy.
Well,

1281
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,333
yeah,
he's around.

1282
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,193
He's around it.
It was a very odd moment when I was 

1283
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:00,150
bothering him.
I was talking to my mom and it was very,

1284
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:02,670
very Catholic and she said to me,
now is what you've been doing?

1285
00:56:02,671 --> 00:56:02,980
I said,
oh,

1286
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:03,650
I'll just do.
I've been.

1287
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:04,483
I actually interviewed a Catholic monk 
was trying to say something in the 

1288
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:06,900
market entertainer.
Yeah,

1289
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:07,811
and she's,
Oh,

1290
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:08,311
well,
what was that?

1291
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:08,581
I said,
well,

1292
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:10,980
he's just a guy called John pridmore 
this gangster,

1293
00:56:10,981 --> 00:56:12,090
and she went,
Oh yes,

1294
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:12,924
I've sat next to him at mass and I was 
at the same place where I don't know 

1295
00:56:15,691 --> 00:56:18,210
what happened,
but like it immediately sort of carry on

1296
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:20,070
your research a bit more with your own 
family.

1297
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:21,780
It was a bit.
It was a bit deflating.

1298
00:56:21,781 --> 00:56:24,850
I was jumping jump in there.
That'd be deflated by that.

1299
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,650
Really.
Somebody when it sounds sort of movement

1300
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:27,760
in the sixties,
you sit around,

1301
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:29,590
rooting around in,
archive your own mother says,

1302
00:56:29,591 --> 00:56:30,424
I've met someone that you've been 
interviewing and switch off show that 

1303
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,300
they have attention,
will say,

1304
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:39,870
Gosh,
you should have done a lot of that.

1305
00:56:39,871 --> 00:56:41,080
Gang started like the sound of your 
book.

1306
00:56:41,081 --> 00:56:41,711
A great dude.
Now,

1307
00:56:41,711 --> 00:56:43,770
what about that thing that I was saying 
at the beginning of the interview that I

1308
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,613
was playing a computer game and the bits
where it's a pirate and it's very like 

1309
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:50,590
when I'm assassin's creed and it's all 
the elaborate missions where I'm robbing

1310
00:56:50,591 --> 00:56:51,910
Spanish galleons,
I like it,

1311
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:54,940
but then when it goes back to the 
subplot where it reveals that you're not

1312
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:55,774
really Hispanic or you're not a pirate,
you're a man in an office pretending to 

1313
00:56:58,541 --> 00:56:59,374
be a pirate and the Games you have to 
play in the office of crap like Pac man 

1314
00:57:02,411 --> 00:57:03,244
looking games.

1315
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,173
I get bored with them,
but really you're probably on a motor 

1316
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:07,144
neuron level doing the same thing,
twiddling your thumbs about moving in 

1317
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:11,470
different directions,
but when you're being the pirate,

1318
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:12,304
it seems like you're smashing over the 
edge of a barrel when you're doing cool 

1319
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:16,000
stuff and when you're in the office it's
boring.

1320
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:21,210
So are we essentially just one as a kind
of an experiencing entity?

1321
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:26,170
Consciousness itself,
receiving data that you said it was like

1322
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,200
electronical impulses and organizing it 
into all different stories.

1323
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,210
Looking for stories that are attractive 
to us,

1324
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:32,044
either because of some personal 
inflection or because of the culture of 

1325
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:36,340
our time.
Validates and enjoys that story.

1326
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:36,941
Yeah,
totally.

1327
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:39,040
So my last book was got the heritage and
it was about exactly.

1328
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:42,310
This is it.
It's about how we experience our lives.

1329
00:57:42,311 --> 00:57:44,500
The story about the brain conjures this 
story.

1330
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:46,140
One neuroscientist I spoke to,
Chris,

1331
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,230
Chris described us.

1332
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:49,080
The illusion the brain makes makes us 
the,

1333
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,210
the invisible actor at the center of the
world and what it does to keep us,

1334
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:56,770
keep us motivated to keep her as happy 
and kind of forward kind of moving is it

1335
00:57:56,771 --> 00:57:59,730
creates this narrative of meaning I 
could call the brand the hero,

1336
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,260
my crew,
but you know,

1337
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,093
it makes us this kind of hero.
It creates this very simplistic story 

1338
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,180
for,
for us to sort of sort of living live in

1339
00:58:07,181 --> 00:58:09,870
the middle of and the computer.
Can you describe.

1340
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,713
It's quite.
It's quite fascinating actually because 

1341
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,540
as you describe it,
when you're the pirate,

1342
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,523
the swashbuckling pirate,
your life is full of meaning and your 

1343
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,630
this heroic morally,
you know,

1344
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,210
justified.
I know you're a part.

1345
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,400
Yeah,
he is a pirate,

1346
00:58:21,401 --> 00:58:23,860
but what he's doing the little bit 
ambiguous because there's quite a lot of

1347
00:58:23,861 --> 00:58:27,510
murder and bloodshed,
but sense that he's theory a bit,

1348
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:28,383
but no,
he's on a journey of discovery because 

1349
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:30,964
there's some sub characters that go when
you're going to give up this piracy and 

1350
00:58:33,851 --> 00:58:34,840
help us with our big.

1351
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,280
So the subtext here.
Yeah,

1352
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:36,800
okay.
Yeah,

1353
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,720
yeah,
but it's this very,

1354
00:58:37,721 --> 00:58:38,260
again,
very,

1355
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,940
very ancient Greek story of of meaning 
and an individual kind of going out into

1356
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:42,783
the world and causing great effects and 
then suddenly switched back into this 

1357
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:48,370
office thing and you're just playing 
this boring guy moving counters.

1358
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,500
It's too close to the actual reality of 
what you're doing.

1359
00:58:50,501 --> 00:58:52,600
Sat up at night playing on a 
playstation.

1360
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:55,700
You've covered generally just like 
smacking your honor.

1361
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,940
It's quite Meta.
It's quite metta.

1362
00:58:58,980 --> 00:58:59,813
They sang that the reality of the pirate
is not your ultimate reality and it may 

1363
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,090
be,
but that is again,

1364
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:06,730
it's sort of a religious idea.
Like when you say this thing that you're

1365
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:10,840
one's ego matrix makes you the hero of 
your own life.

1366
00:59:10,841 --> 00:59:11,674
These scriptures that I'm forever 
banging on about never bother bloody 

1367
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:15,070
reading,
tell you,

1368
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,810
but there is no such thing as self.

1369
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:17,683
You are not the hero of your own life.
You're just experiencing this data and 

1370
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,553
organizing.
It's a but really you all part of the 

1371
00:59:23,901 --> 00:59:24,790
whole.
There is one.

1372
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:27,620
This is the central tenet of all eastern
thinking.

1373
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,890
Separation is an illusion.
You are experiencing this,

1374
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:31,730
but the,
you are one.

1375
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:33,430
You are one with all phenomenon.
Yeah.

1376
00:59:33,431 --> 00:59:34,264
Well I think,
I think there will be one thing I think 

1377
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:38,880
that goes back to these confucian ideas 
of if you know of collectivity and it,

1378
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,460
but I think the part of that,
the,

1379
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,313
the,
the modern kind of scientific kind of 

1380
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,150
does,
does bear out is,

1381
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,620
is that,
is that we are,

1382
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:46,573
that is this kind of illusion that we 
are living in this kind of the story 

1383
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,700
which we live our lives in.
The middle of his is his,

1384
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:53,030
uh,
is uh,

1385
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:53,920
construction.
I mean,

1386
00:59:53,921 --> 00:59:54,230
what do we have?

1387
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:55,430
What we really,
really know.

1388
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:56,523
All we know is the information is 
hitting our senses and our senses 

1389
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:02,390
experience that information is millions 
and millions of little electrical pulses

1390
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:06,410
and it uses those electrical policies 
like computer code to build reality that

1391
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:07,244
we experience is real.
All the colors and shapes and patterns 

1392
01:00:09,471 --> 01:00:10,304
and sounds and it is a construction and 
it is a story and and it makes us feel 

1393
01:00:14,721 --> 01:00:17,480
important or meaningful like the pirate 
in assassin's creed,

1394
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:18,493
but really strip all that away and we.
What are we with the guy in the office 

1395
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:26,740
with the tiddlywinks in my tip link 
alone will.

1396
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,620
I've really enjoyed this.
What five books should pay.

1397
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:33,350
Obviously we take for granted that 
people should read your book Selfie.

1398
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,990
What five books do think I should go and
rate isn't?

1399
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,810
No,
I'm going to do good in it.

1400
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:41,800
What the pertaining to these ideas now,
right?

1401
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:42,743
See your clever right now.
Clever man will tell us five bucks to 

1402
01:00:46,431 --> 01:00:48,950
read and you've got basically your five 
favorite books.

1403
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:51,290
You reckon we should rave when we'll get
out of it?

1404
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:52,610
Okay,
cool.

1405
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:53,510
Okay,
well there you go.

1406
01:00:53,511 --> 01:00:55,560
Probably say sapiens off the top of my 
head.

1407
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:57,560
Where there were the,
I guess the,

1408
01:00:57,561 --> 01:00:57,790
the,
the,

1409
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:58,623
the,
the two books that are kind of 

1410
01:00:59,001 --> 01:00:59,834
essentially this is the geography of 
thought rigidness bit which talks about 

1411
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:03,050
these Greek ideas.
Cool.

1412
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:03,830
There's,
um,

1413
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:04,663
the happiness hypothesis by an American 
neuroscience psychology is called 

1414
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:11,330
Jonathan Haidt.
Height h a Idt.

1415
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,130
That's cool.
That height,

1416
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,580
because we don't have to be called hate,
like,

1417
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,840
no,
I don't want to call them haters.

1418
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,970
Let's call it kind of.
It's.

1419
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,860
Got It.
Hi Jonathan.

1420
01:01:18,861 --> 01:01:19,694
Hi.
The book I'm reading reading at the 

1421
01:01:21,141 --> 01:01:21,974
moment,
which I love the people of the rbs by 

1422
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:27,523
Jack London.
If you read the people at the rbs by 

1423
01:01:28,301 --> 01:01:28,790
Jack London.

1424
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:29,980
Now people.
Yeah.

1425
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:32,990
So he say so it's an amazing book.
Wrote White Fang.

1426
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,220
Yeah,
exactly.

1427
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:35,054
So what he did,
he wrote a nonfiction book and I think 

1428
01:01:36,141 --> 01:01:36,660
it was 19.
Oh,

1429
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:37,493
two where he went in,
he saw the east end of London has this 

1430
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:42,410
amazingly dangerous wild place,
which it was.

1431
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,493
And he dressed up as a poor person and 
went into an adventure into who's 

1432
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:49,040
playing computer games in real life.
Yeah.

1433
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:49,874
But it's amazing.
It's an amazing book and it's really 

1434
01:01:51,831 --> 01:01:53,540
like some of those old books are very 
difficult to read,

1435
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:58,110
but it's really almost three of your 
golf football,

1436
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:00,343
potato.
He goes into a secondhand clothes shop 

1437
01:02:01,941 --> 01:02:04,300
and get us all the garb and gets dressed
up and stuff and you know,

1438
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,153
you talked about getting into that.
What's that famous is it cooks the map 

1439
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:07,973
shops still there in covent garden where
all the adventure is used to go and get 

1440
01:02:09,561 --> 01:02:10,394
their maps of darkest Africa and he said
I'm going to journey into the east end 

1441
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:14,151
of London.
And they went,

1442
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:16,280
well we can't help you with that.
That's dangerous.

1443
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:21,660
So that's a really work of nonfiction,
which I didn't think sort of people kind

1444
01:02:21,661 --> 01:02:22,494
of know the bitch about the people of 
the abyss and its description of what 

1445
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:29,340
these standards like in those days.
It's just extraordinary.

1446
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,673
That edit and I'm sorta.
Could I have a yard a please fucking 

1447
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,790
fuck.
Who are deaf with my boner.

1448
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:41,743
Sorry.
I tried to spend together too many 

1449
01:02:42,331 --> 01:02:45,570
friends at the swearing.
So.

1450
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,820
Well what's the next one?
We've done free done three.

1451
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:48,870
Oh,
what else can I talk about?

1452
01:02:48,871 --> 01:02:50,050
I can talk about,
um,

1453
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,720
a Star Zealand bat and a funder that's 
one of my favorite nonfiction books.

1454
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,520
Woo.
Sealand nothing book.

1455
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:57,383
Yeah.
So she goes out into East Germany and 

1456
01:02:58,021 --> 01:02:59,790
discoveries about the,
about the study,

1457
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,730
but I guess the book,
my favorite book,

1458
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:02,583
the maybe you want to be a nonfiction 
writer is a book called bad wisdom by a 

1459
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,193
bill drummond x off the care and Mark 
Manning of Zodiac mind open the love 

1460
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:13,170
reaction and,
and so,

1461
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,123
but back in the wisdom yet it's an 
amazing travel log that they decided to 

1462
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:21,630
try and save the world by driving to the
North Pole and a Ford escort and putting

1463
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,980
an icon of Elvis Presley on it.

1464
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:26,520
And it's there kind of in.
It's their story of them doing that.

1465
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:28,440
And it's um,
the first,

1466
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:31,260
the first line is I am shit scared,
shit,

1467
01:03:31,261 --> 01:03:33,450
scared of almost everything and never 
opened that book going.

1468
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:35,100
Got,
this book's going to be amazing.

1469
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:36,300
And it is,
it's an amazing book.

1470
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:40,770
I've even got his tattoo on my shoulder,
Zodiac mind,

1471
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,000
there's a line that he says in the book 
they're afraid.

1472
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:45,660
So we are Zen masters and we know what 
the fuck we're talking about.

1473
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:51,130
One triangle thing is the zed is not a 
very good tattoo in the middle.

1474
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:02,990
So actual actual zed as superman.
When I was a boy,

1475
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,800
right as superman,
I used to see the yellow bear,

1476
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,230
not the red bit,
but I'd never knew until I was old.

1477
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:12,750
That was a red s in the middle of his 
chest.

1478
01:04:12,751 --> 01:04:14,700
Those to try and when I draw and draw 
that logo,

1479
01:04:14,701 --> 01:04:18,360
I draw the yellow bits.
I have knowing that there was a red x in

1480
01:04:18,361 --> 01:04:19,920
the middle.
I had to sleep man wallpaper.

1481
01:04:19,921 --> 01:04:21,700
Exactly the same thing.
The yellow what?

1482
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,380
Those yellow light shapes like whales 
because it's an s in the middle.

1483
01:04:25,381 --> 01:04:26,700
Yeah.
That's a nice.

1484
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,680
We were looking at the wrong color 
wheel.

1485
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:29,923
We wasted.

1486
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:32,963
We're wasting our lives.
Garrett just did a Benny Hill blue 

1487
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,840
there,
which really brought me back to myself.

1488
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,030
All right,
thanks man.

1489
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:39,720
That's really cool.
Effects for those books.

1490
01:04:39,721 --> 01:04:40,800
Thanks for your time.
Beautiful.

1491
01:04:40,801 --> 01:04:41,640
Thank you.
Thank you.

1492
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,260
