1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
Sort of like your online voice style,
like through blogging and talking about 

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:08,880
Scottish independence.
Now that you're in winter,

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,970
more international level of notoriety.
It's talking more about class,

4
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:15,774
but I'm assuming that when you were 
talking about independent class was a 

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,630
big component.
Can you talk to me about,

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,970
I mean that's how I came Kim and our 
possession of conflict,

7
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:25,804
the wife sections of the yes movement 
because you know like all movements 

8
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:30,384
there's a disagreement in certain 
pockets about what the priorities are 

9
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:36,450
and what posture we should assume 
generally saw.

10
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:37,284
It was the sort of,
for me and a lot of other people on the 

11
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:44,760
Ken of left and the radical left we we 
we didn't see,

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,623
we didn't really buy into the idea that 
independence foster and then we'll talk 

13
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,460
about all this stuff later.
We thought,

14
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:51,211
no,
hang on way.

15
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:54,330
Got All this trouble of having 
independence.

16
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,550
If we've not got a really set up an idea
of what we're,

17
00:00:56,551 --> 00:01:00,390
what I do and relation to taxation,
social housing,

18
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:01,950
welfare,
drug policy,

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,813
education.
Like let's really get into the detail 

20
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:06,204
about that stuff because that may be the
thing that mobilizes more people on the 

21
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,260
desk and franchise communities who are,
you know,

22
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,560
usually apathetic towards politics and 
for good reason.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,993
So I would be bringing up class usually 
on relation to art because I was 

24
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,770
creating music [inaudible] eh,
the themes that are thought of Mlg,

25
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:29,340
no of the independence,
the beer.

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,593
And uh,
sometimes I would comment a conflict 

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,293
when I would go and perform at arts 
events that Wa like felt very sort of 

28
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:39,714
student here in middle class.
And there's a certain expectation about 

29
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:43,404
what's appropriate.
You'll notice from your expedience of a 

30
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:47,150
pr as a performer,
although,

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,113
because you're more established,
no people will tend to come to whatever 

32
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:51,840
you are or an ass shoes.

33
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,973
But when you're just meeting people for 
the fast team and you're using the 

34
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:59,320
vernacular and a lexicon and,
and,

35
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,183
and,
and things that may be perceived as 

36
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:03,640
vulgar on aggressive,
then Eh,

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,553
you just feel resistance and for Mina 
and reason then testing questions 

38
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:10,650
because one of my premed,
new tress and,

39
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,773
and dependence was that the 
regionalization of culture and Bratton 

40
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,740
means that a lot of great writers and 
artists from different places under your

41
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,133
care who don't have friends and sort of 
London bubble that just get ignored or 

42
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,190
seniors cain off like firebrands or they
get bracketed in a certain way.

43
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,640
And so our thought independence's 
perhaps it'll viscerally,

44
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:40,080
I fought independence is a way for us to
create our own culture and our own,

45
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,720
uh,
and configure it out and I'll eat it.

46
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,390
Makes sense to us.
Um,

47
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,720
but then there was a lot of self 
interest involved as well and hand say,

48
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,583
you know what,
it was sad of being a bigger fashion or 

49
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:51,870
smaller point.

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,900
You know,
I've been ranting for 15 years.

51
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,890
I'm very,
I'm very competent.

52
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,870
I'm very passionate about it.
Um,

53
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,930
but even in Scotland,
the idea of wrapping with my own accent,

54
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,380
it's like a joke for a lot of people.
And uh,

55
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,510
and that's even worse when you go,
don't,

56
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:12,450
so if you're not old or,
oh,

57
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,650
the grain rappers and all the MCS doe 
neil's are pervading,

58
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,503
protested the of your key hot port.
So it was just like all of those 

59
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:20,134
reasons.
But then when Al got any further 

60
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,353
discussions,
west people who were running these arts 

61
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,140
events and I was wanting to talk about 
class,

62
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,070
or I had class beast disputes where for 
them then they were like,

63
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:32,830
we'll talk about this later.
We'll talk about this after.

64
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,880
And they would try and play,
keep me in various ways,

65
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,720
obviously underestimate and how 
passionate I was about.

66
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,093
So that became a sort of a divergence 
point for me and a lot of other people 

67
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:46,300
were for the yes movement.
That still remains to this day.

68
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,420
I would see.
What is the nature of this dispute?

69
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,254
What is the nature of this disparity 
between what I'm picking out you're 

70
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:54,184
describing as a more educated or to use 
a classical or conventional word or 

71
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:00,970
more?
Uh,

72
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,803
the more bourgeois aspect of the left 
and the working class contingencies and 

73
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,050
then also this dispute.
Oh,

74
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,690
also a national fooled at the sin and 
over always will.

75
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,880
So it's,
it's not,

76
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,753
I wouldn't characterize it as a dispute,
although it does manifest as a 

77
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,030
confrontation and acrimony.
I would characterize it as,

78
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,360
um,
things getting lost in translation.

79
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,810
So we currently think about culture as a
sort of continuum where people,

80
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,393
uh,
near the bottom are waiting to sort of 

81
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:38,614
graduate to become legitimate by virtue 
of their willingness to either conceal 

82
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,050
or renounce those indicate who they 
actually are with.

83
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,130
Whereas assay working class culture as a
parallel culture and that there are many

84
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:58,450
contradictions,
x interest at ease lessons.

85
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:02,050
There's a lot of wisdom,
a lot of things that are very distinct.

86
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,041
Uh,
I mean,

87
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,874
I've been socially more bail enough and 
wife that I've maxed a lot across a 

88
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,344
ravine.
So over the years I've built up an 

89
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:12,184
understanding of some of these fault 
lanes and that the big donor and 

90
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:16,894
communication often can come from simply
a difference in a sense of urgency or 

91
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:24,760
priority on the watts that someone 
newsies.

92
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,010
So what you might see is what you meet 
cs passion.

93
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,993
Someone sees it as aggression,
pushiness of what you might see as 

94
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,930
polite.
Someone thinks his pattern isn't,

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,833
it's the combination of all of these 
little instances where people come away 

96
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:42,940
from an attempt to mango across the 
ravine,

97
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,133
that that just becomes natural to sort 
of recall back to where it's 

98
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:48,280
comfortable,
where people are gritty.

99
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,620
Whereas Alec,
to be on the lane,

100
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,300
I'm more comfortable in the medal.
I come from a working class background,

101
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,450
I'm passionate about it.
But back then in my youth there would be

102
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:02,330
people trying to police how I spoke that
wants the are years,

103
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,313
the things that I was interested then a 
very rigid idea about what a young man 

104
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:09,920
should be.
And I resented that and challenge that.

105
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,960
But then at the same time on the other 
side,

106
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,213
then even just the things that I want to
talk about and the way that I wouldn't 

107
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:17,080
if fema is changing,
no,

108
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,740
cause I've kind of been caught saying 
the bay,

109
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:21,530
a few legitimate people notes about 
like,

110
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,190
oh this we must have Garvey.
But beforehand it was very,

111
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,024
it was very much a struggle.
I had to kind of manipulate my way into 

112
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,160
the middle class,
feels like stop wearing a hood.

113
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,993
They start wearing a blazer,
wearing a pair of glasses instead of a 

114
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,594
baseball cap and learn to talk.
Like middle class people were alarmed 

115
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,930
that for them that's the sort of form of
currency,

116
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,610
not necessarily being clever but sonin 
clever on an amount of that.

117
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:50,444
I sort of picked up on that.
That's when I became more socially 

118
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,260
mobile than perhaps my education with 
the valid.

119
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,133
Maybe make some good points there.
One of the things I recently learned 

120
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,374
about the way that hedge money is 
constructed is with the imposition of a 

121
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:07,734
narrative and have a language within it.
And the way I learned it when I'm doing 

122
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:11,994
this course at university,
they said that the way that the western 

123
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,923
world or so called secular work deals 
with Islam or Middle East and countries 

124
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,503
is with the assumption that there's a,
a narrative for Islam has to go through 

125
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:29,430
that will conform to what uh,
post,

126
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,680
uh,
like I like that,

127
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,563
that create,
that Christian history has been through 

128
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:34,914
lie a prostin ecm and Catholicism is 
secularization when as you did when you 

129
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,210
were describing working class culture,
the entity,

130
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:45,800
it's a parallel narrative that there is,
there is a separate Islamic narrative,

131
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,643
there's a separate working class 
narrative and you don't have these 

132
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:49,524
things need,
didn't necessarily conflate and 

133
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:55,680
certainly what you would call I suppose 
secondary or sub narratives.

134
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,550
It can't be subsumed in the infocomm is 
dominant narrative.

135
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:00,670
Yeah.
So like,

136
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,040
yeah,
I like that mate.

137
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,600
What you said that you have to even on 
the level of lighting,

138
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,513
the way that you accessorize pop on a 
pair of specs instead of a baseball cap 

139
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:12,740
to be more sort of identifiable.
But then when you do that,

140
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:15,620
you comment in conflict with where you 
actually come from,

141
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,860
you up pop gagan a blazer and people are
like,

142
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:19,710
well,
your hood there,

143
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,060
who do you hang?
Yeah,

144
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,370
and saw that actually is not as much as 
as as that.

145
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,204
That has been difficult at times.
It seem team of kind of like I've tried 

146
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:34,190
to stay true to what I wore one,
and really with the book,

147
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,293
what I was trying to do was engage 
multiple people from multiple 

148
