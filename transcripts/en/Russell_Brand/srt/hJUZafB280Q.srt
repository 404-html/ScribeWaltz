00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:06,664
universities,
Windham Campbell literature prize born 

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,083
in north India.
His work has appeared in the New York 

4
00:00:11,771 --> 00:00:15,460
Times time.
The Guardian and the independent and his

5
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:16,294
books include an end to suffering the 
Buddha in the world from the ruins of 

6
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:24,760
empire and he's latest age of anger,
a history of the present,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,880
which explains how the wider embrace of 
mass politics,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
technology and the pursuit of wealth and
individualism has cost billions of drift

9
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,300
and the demoralized world.
Welcome to the show Pankaj.

10
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:38,680
Thank you for kindness.
Thanks for having me.

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,040
What I know of your work suggests to me 
that you are addressing themes that have

12
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:52,230
interest did us on under the skin and 
driven us w w w but on a huge scale.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,913
You're trying to address there the 
essence of what we've been trying to 

14
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:01,270
tackle on a global scale.

15
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,860
Your latest book,
age of anger.

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,250
You're talking about rage that that this
is a sort of,

17
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,920
this is a time that is determined by 
rate.

18
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,933
Are you saying that this is,
this is cross culturally regardless of 

19
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,770
where you are in this particular 
economic story?

20
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,100
Like whether it's like the claps of 
empire that you know,

21
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:18,934
and nostalgia that's been experienced in
this country or the United States where 

22
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,360
rage is,
feels like a very present emotion,

23
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,300
rage and despair on recent visits to 
America.

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,313
I sort of felt enough the few public 
spaces that I was in a sense a sense of 

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,510
a society ill at ease with itself.
So like,

26
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,200
and I've experienced it in these two 
western nations,

27
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,100
but you're saying in India is this also 
a uh,

28
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,170
a modern cultural,
the at the center of rage?

29
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,000
Well,
the,

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
the experience of disaffection or rage 
is at this moment truly global,

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,733
truly common amongst you know,
nations regardless of where they are in 

32
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:03,564
the,
so called,

33
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,580
you know,
uh,

34
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,080
this,
this,

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,520
this particular tragic tree of,
of economic growth.

36
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:10,520
So in the advanced countries as well as 
the developed world,

37
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,710
the developing countries and so on,
so forth.

38
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,790
And I think it's because in,
in a,

39
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:17,624
in a context like the United States,
which has enjoyed a great deal of power 

40
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:24,280
for a long time,
a lot of people feel that,

41
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,173
uh,
the future and this is an unprecedented 

42
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:32,551
shift would be considerably worse then 
what they have been accustomed to,

43
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:38,570
what the parents and grandparents that 
they are not really passing on.

44
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,693
You know,
it was to the children or the 

45
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:46,010
grandchildren in wish they can actually 
hope to flourish.

46
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,140
And this is important package because 
progressivism is the defining attribute,

47
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:55,440
the essence of the story.
So once progression stops,

48
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,390
once the next generation of things,
hang on a minute,

49
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:59,650
things are getting worse.
We're not going to own our houses,

50
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:02,530
we're not going to have jobs.
We were already mired in debt.

51
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,660
The whole thrust of our national 
identities is undermined,

52
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,800
is the crux of the crisis.
Uh,

53
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,720
you know,
progress was,

54
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,780
the substitute was a replacement for 
God.

55
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,773
This notion of continuous improvement 
that was truly radical when we killed 

56
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:23,384
off God,
when we moved away from traditional 

57
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,130
religion be devices,
new belief system,

58
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,293
that there will be continuous progress.
And we have revised our existence on 

59
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:33,944
this fact,
so I mean we must not underestimate the 

60
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:39,210
radical shifts we are undergoing right 
now.

61
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,143
So I suppose if you were living in a 
culture that is experiencing continued 

62
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,183
economic growth and progression or at 
least a significant portion of the 

63
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,790
population are experiencing it enough to
maintain the momentum,

64
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,893
then there is no need for God 
particularly that it when the idea of 

65
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:59,440
God is often eh demonstrated through 
ancestor worship,

66
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,590
we are like our ancestors.
We live like them,

67
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,020
that we are connected to this origin 
myth,

68
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:05,854
this origin story,
and through these rituals we connect to 

69
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,330
them.
This is our relationship with God.

70
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:13,030
We are part of the whole,
when you see continual progression,

71
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:13,864
when you've seen an advancement of 
mankind and obviously the shifts 

72
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,883
philosophically that occurred a couple 
of hundred years ago that you mentioned 

73
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:20,944
at the beginning of this conversation,
it's very easy to see us as separate 

74
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:24,754
from God,
God as the idea of originator creator 

75
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,840
progenator.

76
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,631
Absolutely.
It's a,

77
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:32,120
it's a radical idea in or some,
someone warned about this,

78
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,463
that progress is the false gold.
The chip when he said that God is dead 

79
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,820
and we haven't faced up to the 
consequences.

80
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,654
This is what he was talking about,
that we've given our belief in a 

81
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,043
transcendental authority.
We've given up believe in this God who 

82
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,540
lays down laws,
who orders our societies.

83
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,240
We have decided to go do it all by 
ourselves and we have invested our faith

84
00:04:55,641 --> 00:05:00,000
in progress.
But this is a false religion.

85
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,740
And I think in many ways this moment of 
Neil is in that pc today,

86
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,200
globally is this realization that this 
religion is faltering,

87
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,480
that there are not enough believers in 
the religion of progress.

88
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,600
This is the biggest shift.
This is what I'm really talking about in

89
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:20,920
my book.
And that is what I mean,

90
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:25,180
that we need to have a broader framework
to understand what is going on today.

91
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,760
I mean,
there are obviously many aspect of this,

92
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,520
um,
the economic inequality and of obviously

93
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,443
a lot of the rage is fuel by people 
thinking that the promises happy and 

94
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:39,930
unrealized,
they've been fulfill.

95
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:41,640
They've been cheated,
they've been deceived.

96
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,510
But it's also because they have been 
promised a great deal,

97
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,510
especially in the last three decades of 
globalization.

98
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,770
Did you ever believe when the,
um,

99
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,873
sort of the,
the research an ethno nationalism fails 

100
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:54,864
to deliver and I suppose there is a 
version of ethno nationalism or least 

101
00:05:57,261 --> 00:06:02,261
sort of a re a religiously led ethno 
nationalism in India also when I suppose

102
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:07,160
when these modalities foul or deliver,
there will be further disappointment and

103
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:07,994
further rate.
Or just to ask you a sort of a personal 

104
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:11,580
question,
presuming a,

105
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,400
if you grew up in a village in India,
I'm guessing your religious town.

106
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,393
So you had a religious talk about 
bringing to you believe in God and what 

107
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,510
kind of religion were you raised in?

108
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,720
Personally?
I mean I,

109
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:22,554
I think of myself as someone who's been 
iridium irredeemably be secularized in 

110
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,140
the sense that I cannot be religious in 
the way my parents are religious,

111
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,373
religious in the sense of thinking that 
everything that happens in the world is 

112
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:42,050
due to God is because there is a hidden 
invisible force behind all of it.

113
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,923
And,
and then everything that happens can be 

114
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:52,230
explained with reference to this figure.
Now that is,

115
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,110
it will be that I now can no longer 
enter.

116
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,600
But when you begin,
when you,

117
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,493
when you are in proximity to it,
you do realize that the big shift 

118
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:04,270
really.
Um,

119
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,070
and,
and you see that happening right now,

120
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:07,750
that shift happened here a long time 
ago.

121
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:09,820
In places like India,
you can still see it happening.

122
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,133
Is this shift from belief in 
transcendental authority to this belief 

123
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,900
in progress,
in material improvement?

124
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,660
Isn't that just a different form of 
transcendent or authority?

125
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:25,971
Well,
that was,

126
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:28,940
that was the mistake.
A lot of people in the 19th century were

127
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:29,774
pointing to Dostoevsky or nature that 
once you bring down the Kingdom of God 

128
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,610
onto earth,
you will have trouble.

129
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,983
Once you start thinking that what is 
promised to you in the afterlife can be 

130
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,420
recreated on earth.
When you start thinking in those terms,

131
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,840
then you've set yourself up for cruel 
disappointment.

132
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,850
Yes.
Also,

133
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:58,851
it seems that we've become quite muddled
in our interpretation of myth.

134
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,820
It seems to me,
even when I hear the phrase after life,

135
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,913
uh,
how the resonance of that for me 

136
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:13,200
personally is now when my material,
human life as Russell,

137
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:18,201
the individual where my ego life ceases 
to be the dominant driving principle for

138
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:23,190
my existence,
I will experience inadvertent Commerce,

139
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,520
Heaven,
paradise freed from the ego.

140
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,250
So that,
you know,

141
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,083
when,
when I see sort of perennial messages 

142
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:31,080
between Hinduism,
Buddhism,

143
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,730
Christianity,
and believe me,

144
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:35,490
I know very little about all three of 
those theologies,

145
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,473
just enough to know that there seems to 
be an idea of essence and even the more 

146
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:46,810
folkish and uh,
I'm assuming less academic understanding

147
00:08:46,811 --> 00:08:49,120
that one imagines that your parents may 
have had,

148
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:49,770
I don't know,
your,

149
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,790
that could have been a professor of 
theology.

150
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,624
I don't know if,
I'm guessing when people talk about 

151
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,453
religion and sort of quite folkish terms
of a transcendent or fora a got this 

152
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,704
basically governing everything I can 
sorta eve like even with my limited 

153
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:05,820
understanding of the mechanics of the 
material world,

154
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:09,030
I can see a use for that as a,
as an analogy,

155
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,390
I can see a use for the idea of supreme 
or transcendent,

156
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,280
hopefully benevolent or authority.

157
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:14,990
Well,
you know,

158
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,823
I mean it has become hugely fashionable 
to mock religion or people who are 

159
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:22,290
religious as essentially superstitious,
ignorant,

160
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,353
barbaric.
But we forget that religion is a huge 

161
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:31,030
source of constellation.
It helps people accommodate,

162
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,953
um,
helps people to accommodate themselves 

163
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:35,950
to grief,
to loss,

164
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,820
to disappointment and disappointment is 
the fate for most people.

165
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,100
Yes.
And in fact possibly all people.

166
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:45,370
I mean cause sometimes when it's 
presented in terms of a consolation,

167
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,880
like that's sort of sort of common new 
atheist argument,

168
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,920
oh it's for Sakos to,
for constantly,

169
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:52,960
but I sort of feel like you are going to
die.

170
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,030
The material world isn't going to make 
you happy.

171
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,720
Your primal drives are going to be 
insufficient in making you satisfied.

172
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,130
Your Ego is going to let you down,
everything's going to fail you,

173
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,023
so you're going to need constellation.
And so on that side as well as 

174
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,040
constellation eight becomes a kind of 
creed,

175
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,070
it becomes a kind of purpose.
It becomes a kind of meaning.

176
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,830
And I don't think a fabricated one 
either.

177
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,100
I think a necessary ultimate,
a central one.

178
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,083
Whilst I recognize that most religions 
have cultural accouterments of their 

179
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:26,350
time that are unhelpful,
prejudicial,

180
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:27,184
you know,
like those are the things that I try 

181
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:32,560
personally to look beyond to this sort 
of powerful truths beneath them.

182
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,670
Now,
uh,

183
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:34,504
again,
Pankaj very the beginning of our 

184
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:37,320
conversation,
you'll have,

185
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,163
you said you're very interested in the 
important shift in the last couple 

186
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,900
hundred years,
philosophically,

187
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:47,410
and we mentioned colonialism and 
industrialization as two components.

188
00:10:47,411 --> 00:10:48,244
Is that,
I'm interested in the philosophical 

189
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:50,224
component.
I know you're talk about voltaire and 

190
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,870
Russo.
Uh,

191
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,930
the philosophers were a little earlier 
than that,

192
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:57,730
but tell us what their significance is.

193
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,460
No,
I use these figures to highlight certain

194
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,294
contradictions in the modern project 
which were apparent before and modern 

195
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:08,180
societies came into being,
you know,

196
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:10,110
in the late 18th century,
put it very,

197
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:13,430
very broadly.
People,

198
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,523
uh,
in the late 18th century we're faced 

199
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:21,791
with this large question that okay we 
are moving away from societies,

200
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,833
from a world in which the church was 
important in which belief in God was 

201
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:27,734
important.
[inaudible] the monarchy was all 

202
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:30,984
powerful.
We are moving towards societies where 

203
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:36,880
people are going to devise a social 
contract for themselves,

204
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,070
uh,
where people are going to use individual

205
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:39,904
reason,
where people are going to use the new 

206
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,233
insights of science to master nature.
So these were the big debates happening 

207
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,920
during the late 18th century.
You know,

208
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,720
what we now call the moment that we now 
call the enlightenment,

209
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,200
the two major figures of this,
uh,

210
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,240
of this enlightened where voltaire and 
Russo and the debate,

211
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,173
the conflict between them emerges 
because full there is offering a model 

212
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,050
and a blueprint for society that we are 
more or less living in today,

213
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,390
which is a society driven by self 
interest,

214
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:19,110
by the entrepreneurial spirits,
by self interested individuals competing

215
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:26,461
with each other,
using the ideas of science to advance,

216
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:30,820
to expand,
to expand their powers.

217
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,510
And Rousseau who comes from very 
different backgrounds,

218
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:37,270
social backgrounds also.
What was the difference?

219
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:37,961
Well,
he,

220
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:38,510
he,
he,

221
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,690
he's known poverty.
He's known deprivation,

222
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,690
um,
in,

223
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,401
in,
in his,

224
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:46,550
in his early years.
We're on the side even forever.

225
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,900
It's on a path and I see all our 
mufflers,

226
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,870
film,
streaks,

227
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,090
yard,
why he knife fights.

228
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,003
So he comes to,
he comes to Paris and find themselves 

229
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,080
alienated by this new world of these 
philosophers talk to each other who were

230
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:08,170
very interested in forming alliances 
with powerful people,

231
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,980
including,
you know,

232
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,813
some of the most powerful monarchs of 
the day because they think the monarchs 

233
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:12,610
are the right people,
you know,

234
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,533
sort of early version of the new concept
today who sidle up to presidents and 

235
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:19,480
prime ministers and offer them advice.
And you know,

236
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,500
here's what you should do in order to 
modernize your society.

237
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:25,750
So this kind of rhetoric,
uh,

238
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,280
Russo is completely against and he's 
talking about human needs,

239
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,660
the needs of the human soul.

240
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,001
And,
and,

241
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:38,001
and he thinks that the society premised 
on self interest on vanity,

242
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,863
on imitation,
on people trying to keep up with the 

243
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:48,070
Joneses,
trying to imitate the rich,

244
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:48,963
the wealthy,
the famous is a recipe for all kinds of 

245
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,450
disorders.
To use a word we,

246
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,730
we,
uh,

247
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,490
brought up earlier,
all kinds of psychological disorders.

248
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,760
And he said he's a sort of acute 
psychologist of the human soul,

249
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,940
partly because he himself is suffering 
from all kinds of problems.

250
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,470
Envy being one of them.
[inaudible] Santino he was at Maine.

251
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,960
Well,
it's a sort of compound of emotions,

252
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,900
envy,
a sense of humiliation,

253
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,830
feeling of powerlessness and it's sort 
of large restlessness.

254
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:26,260
You think it might mean a lot of it,
a lot of that.

255
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,900
And in fact,
what I try and argue in the book that we

256
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,480
are sort of looking at a global epidemic
of reason.

257
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,343
Timo,
where large numbers of people feel this 

258
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:36,904
emotion importantly for the most part.
And when the moment comes as it came 

259
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,720
during brexit and during,
during the trump election,

260
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,673
it erupts volcanically.
So Russo in many ways is anticipating 

261
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,244
the pressures,
the intolerable strain this new society 

262
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,580
promotes around self interest and vanity
is going to put on the human soul.

263
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,180
All right?
He sort of prophesies is in a sense that

264
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:07,270
this will lead us to this crisis.
It will lead us to a spiritual crisis.

265
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,310
Russo also,
he talks about like the noble savage.

266
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:11,840
Is that right?
Is that right?

267
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:16,380
The idea that innately we are connected 
to that there is a,

268
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,090
in simple,
uh,

269
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,860
prehistoric or traditional cultures,
there is a beauty.

270
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:23,290
There is a grace that human

271
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,800
[inaudible].
You know what's,

272
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:26,700
what's actually interesting,
uh,

273
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,720
what is in fact I'm creating this 
particular image in Rousseau's.

274
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:32,634
Mine are the discoveries European 
travelers are making in the new world 

275
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:39,540
when they're encountering indigenous 
peoples in these places.

276
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,600
They're bringing back reports of how 
these societies work.

277
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:45,720
So the whole idea of people living in 
nature.

278
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,350
This is a sort of particular 
construction that Rousseau,

279
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,213
someone like Rousseau absorb many among 
many other people and and uses that to 

280
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:56,250
critique this new society that is coming
into being,

281
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:57,810
you know,
compassion for instance,

282
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,793
is hugely important to Rousseau.
He thinks the innate revulsion we feel 

283
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,480
at the sight of someone else's 
suffering.

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,670
That should be the basis of the social 
contract,

285
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,430
right?
That tried to use that as a feel.

286
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,353
It's interesting that you talk about 
these essential bases that political 

287
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:22,111
movements and political moments are 
somehow ultimately underwritten by inner

288
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,393
phenomena or inner frequencies.
That Rousseau argues that compassion 

289
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,680
should be the basis for our social 
contracts.

290
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,603
And what we're experiencing now,
you argue in your book is rage as the 

291
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:42,010
determinant that w or respond to more a 
feeling of worthlessness.

292
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,933
And like this for me seems most familiar
and like one of my frustrations is to 

293
00:16:47,951 --> 00:16:52,630
see the way that brexit has subsequently
been packaged by the sort of,

294
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:54,940
certainly in terms of the media that 
dominant,

295
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,893
uh,
writers of our story that the dominant 

296
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,950
cultural commentators,
oh,

297
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:04,300
what brexit means is racism.
The ordinary people are racist.

298
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:09,130
And I think that that that is the kind 
of reductive ism that led to brexit.

299
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:09,964
I think.
I think that what actually has happened 

300
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:14,940
is a breakdown between the proletariat 
and the bourgeoisie that the bourgeoisie

301
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:19,210
and no longer interested in representing
the interest of ordinary working people,

302
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,133
ordinary working people have began to 
recognize that and while certainly 

303
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:23,704
concerned about migration and racism,
how could they not be part of a 

304
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:30,970
narrative given how much those ideas are
propagated through mainstream media?

305
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,000
Like I think it's more important than 
that.

306
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,950
I think the shift is between a middle 
class intelligentsia sort of abandoned,

307
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:39,784
ordinary working people to form a new 
alliance with the powerful and to 

308
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,853
demonstrate their radicalism merely 
through superficial allegiances with 

309
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:51,990
identity politics,
identity politics as like,

310
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,093
oh no,
well we're very good on gender rights 

311
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:58,230
were very good and the quality in our 
race without consequence,

312
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,183
you know,
no longer addressing the key issue of 

313
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,760
all societies.
How do we control the powerful,

314
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,930
how do we confront the powerful,
how do we bring about equality,

315
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,860
fairness as a society based on the 
compassion that you said that Russo's

316
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,703
I feel it's a huge mistake to judge 
people who vote for trump or who voted 

317
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:21,034
for brexit as racists.
It's counterproductive apart from 

318
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:26,440
anything else.
It's wrong.

319
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,460
It's,
it's,

320
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,950
it's totally wrong.
A lot of people who voted for trump also

321
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:33,760
voted for Obama the biggest hoax of our 
times.

322
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,613
Um,

323
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,320
so what a Bama is the biggest hoax 
finding.

324
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,173
So I think so.
It's interesting because we've had an 

325
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:42,540
academic in here a little while ago.
I,

326
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,374
Hindi Andrews is professor of sociology 
and Black Studies at Birmingham 

327
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,003
University who said that trump is a more
authentic or better president for black 

328
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:51,654
America than a Bama because it no longer
conceals submerged inequalities and 

329
00:18:56,041 --> 00:19:01,041
ongoing racism was the embodiment of new
liberal chic

330
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,830
and managed to conceal as your other 
guests said,

331
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,263
a whole range of grotesque inequalities 
through this very seductive personal 

332
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:18,560
style he had,
you know,

333
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,170
we getting on a different subject 
altogether,

334
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,260
but I think in many ways Obama and eight
years of Obama,

335
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,660
right?
Enabled someone like Donald Trump and if

336
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:35,550
you don't see this connection,
if we insist on thinking of Donald Trump

337
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:40,140
as someone who just arrived in the 
United States from somewhere in Mars,

338
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,750
we are going to miss this.
Yeah.

339
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Is your age in a desperate attempt to 
continue the neo liberal narrative?

340
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,440
Trump is presented as some kind of 
grotesque anomaly,

341
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,500
a product of racism when he is precisely
a product of neo liberalism is precisely

342
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:58,150
the end point.
Like,

343
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,143
how can people,
how does society not have fest are 

344
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:02,804
festering sense of separation and eh and
fear of otherness when we've just 

345
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:08,864
experienced 2030 years have been pumped 
up like anti-islamic sentiment sort of 

346
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:17,270
like pre nine 11 at these stories have 
been going on for a long,

347
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:18,104
long while and he said,
it feels to me that this moment is 

348
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:21,524
simply some someone's just drew like 
ridden that wave a wave that sort of 

349
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:29,570
being created by cyclonic racism and 
ongoing

350
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,920
prejudice.
I think,

351
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,461
I mean,
you know,

352
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:36,461
trump is the image that we don't really 
want to confront of us in the mirror and

353
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:42,430
it's because we keep thinking of this 
other era of which most of us people who

354
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:44,600
write in,
in,

355
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:49,390
in you work for the mainstream media,
I include myself are beneficiaries,

356
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,360
have been beneficiaries of the system,
our lives,

357
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,350
our material lives have improved 
enormously in the last 2030 years.

358
00:20:56,351 --> 00:21:00,160
So we have enormous investments in 
keeping this particular narrative going.

359
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,413
And one way of doing it is to say that 
these people who bought for trump are 

360
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,670
deplorables,
are racists,

361
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,810
and that there is something like true 
liberalism out there.

362
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,673
If only people would listen.
If only people could understand what is 

363
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:16,394
good for them.
Instead they follow the racist thing 

364
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:22,600
stinks and vote for trump.
This is a deliberate misdiagnosis.

365
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,301
Uh,
this is,

366
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:27,810
this is a real distortion of what has 
been happening,

367
00:21:27,811 --> 00:21:30,080
not just in the United States elsewhere.

368
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,920
Okay.
The fact,

369
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,150
you know,
going back to,

370
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,470
so the promise of freedom with which the
modern world begins.

371
00:21:37,471 --> 00:21:40,050
Freedom from authority,
freedom from custom,

372
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,790
the fact that for many people this has 
become hugely,

373
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:49,791
hugely impossible to realize because of 
the nature of our institutions,

374
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,333
the increasing centralization of power,
the fact that most people find 

375
00:21:57,961 --> 00:22:00,510
themselves reduced to cogs in a,
in a,

376
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:05,430
in a boss machine,
most people find very little stability,

377
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,790
very little dignity in their working 
lives.

378
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,480
All this has led to this moment that we 
are experiencing today.

379
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,171
You know,
this,

380
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:14,831
this,
you know,

381
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:18,280
on one hand this extravagant promise of 
freedom,

382
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,683
prosperity,
and then the fact of structural 

383
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:23,794
inequality.
The fact that mobility is blocked for 

384
00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:30,440
most people unless he belonged to the 
right family,

385
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:32,780
unless you belong to the right dynasty,
unless you belong,

386
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,850
unless you go to the right college.
And you know,

387
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,800
this is not something that I'm saying or
a few people are saying.

388
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:43,801
This is now been demonstrated 
empirically with all kinds of data.

389
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,323
Um,
the fact that college educated people 

390
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,960
have a huge advantage over everyone 
else.

391
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:54,270
That morbidity has been blocked for 
large numbers of people.

392
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,553
So we are looking at a massive 
dysfunction in which all the founding 

393
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:05,770
promises of the modern world look almost
impossible to fulfill

394
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,560
if feels like the conditions are correct
for genuine radicalism,

395
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,573
for real radical change.
It seems that there's potential for 

396
00:23:15,871 --> 00:23:20,190
explosive global change.
Where do you think that it's,

397
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,143
I mean it's a big question.
Do you think those societies to 

398
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:23,874
sectarian two fractured cause?
I like it because I'm a public 

399
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:29,300
performer.
I am often [inaudible] and I work in a,

400
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,590
mostly in this country at the moment I 
like,

401
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,453
I'm often in regional spaces of with 
1500 or a couple of thousand people 

402
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:37,284
doing stand up comedy.
And one of the things I talk about is 

403
00:23:38,521 --> 00:23:39,354
how the powerful continually invite 
ordinary working people to I want to 

404
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:44,990
enough,
uh,

405
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,200
suspiciously when I as a veil for the 
actions of the powerful.

406
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,110
So like I sort of watch people's faces 
as I say,

407
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,143
you know,
you will always do what you've always 

408
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:57,464
done.
Blame other people that are basically 

409
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:03,350
the same as you that don't have power 
for things that only powerful people can

410
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:04,310
affect or change.

411
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,780
So,
and then in the show I say,

412
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:07,460
fuck Muslims,
fuck with disabled.

413
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:09,350
Fuck the white working class,
middle class.

414
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:10,131
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

415
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:11,660
Fuck you.
Fuck can you thanks for your vote.

416
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:16,070
See you in four years.
And I see that this divides the room.

417
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:21,130
I see that people are uncomfortable in 
letting go of more immediate sense of it

418
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,013
is the problem I feel sometimes with the
mind is there are certain stories that 

419
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:28,754
are easier to believe.
There is stories that are more visceral 

420
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,460
that relate more to our experience of 
being human.

421
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,473
It's hard to,
concealed power is very difficult to 

422
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:40,460
understand.
By its very nature,

423
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,351
it's,
I mean,

424
00:24:41,351 --> 00:24:46,351
you know,
the other factor is that in the West and

425
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:51,581
western Europe and the United States,
we haven't had mass movements for change

426
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:53,900
for a very long time.
You know,

427
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:58,520
if you think about it,
the last time we had mass movements,

428
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,380
large numbers of people participating in
them against the war for civil rights,

429
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,700
feminist movement,
this,

430
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,040
these all happened in the 1960s and 
seventies.

431
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,263
So whole memory of popular participation
in politics of large numbers of people 

432
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:18,310
coming together for a particular cause 
of justice,

433
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,710
bonding together,
feeling degree of solidarity.

434
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,810
That memory has been x,
you know,

435
00:25:24,811 --> 00:25:26,160
completely expunged

436
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,523
possibly because of the success of the 
philosophy that you said Voltaire was 

437
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:32,474
exemplary of that.
We do regard ourselves as individuals 

438
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:35,834
now that liberalism that it means 
freedom to be an individual and freedom 

439
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:41,144
to meet be an individual means freedom 
to be disconnected and an inability to 

440
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:49,280
see your identity is integral to the,
to the roles,

441
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,114
relationships and destinies of people 
that are basically just the same as if 

442
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,090
we live in,
in an interdependent society.

443
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,790
Yes.
That we live in an interdependent

444
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,643
world.
Um,

445
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,533
you know,
this is something the Buddhist started 

446
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:03,850
talking about 2,500
years ago.

447
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,170
I wrote a book about the put that where 
this team feature is a great deal.

448
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,063
The team of interdependence,
which the would that invoke in order to 

449
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:18,600
critique the rising notion of 
individualism at the time.

450
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,470
I mean this,
this,

451
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,500
this notion of the individual self that 
has to express fine,

452
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,380
that has to consolidate itself with all 
kinds of material advances and,

453
00:26:31,351 --> 00:26:31,861
and,
and,

454
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:34,410
and,
and guide of intellectual growth,

455
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,690
which is what has become so dominant,
especially in the last three decades.

456
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:40,524
A kind of hyper individualism,
which is unconstrained by any 

457
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:45,870
institution,
you know.

458
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:46,893
Mm.
That is what has been propagated and 

459
00:26:50,981 --> 00:26:54,110
also swallowed whole by large numbers of
people,

460
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,980
which has really frayed,
so many social sorted out at ds,

461
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,113
which is again,
sort of really destroyed I imagination 

462
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:05,320
in some crucial ways.
You know,

463
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:10,330
whole ways of acting in the world upon 
the world has been lost to us because of

464
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:14,190
this obsession with individualism.

465
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,920
We mentioned and I've,
uh,

466
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,873
somewhat frame this conversation within 
the idea that there is an imposition of 

467
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:25,800
progressivism on,
uh,

468
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:31,810
but on former colonized nations by 
former colonial nations,

469
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,010
enough,
uh,

470
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,380
competing at low,
less powerful,

471
00:27:36,381 --> 00:27:40,380
but I think still interesting story is 
the raw and,

472
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,243
and perhaps a component of Orient,
Orient Elysium is the romanticization 

473
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,820
that also comes from sort of I suppose.
So they like,

474
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,663
cause for me,
meeting you as an Indian man that grew 

475
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:54,980
up in a small town and me as a person 
who's a,

476
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:55,883
and my body is smothered in tattoos from
your great scriptures of figures and 

477
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:05,210
icons and gods from your scriptures.
And cause I write literal text.

478
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:05,610
Yeah,
yeah.

479
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,120
Love smothered in Bloody Sanskrit,
Krishna's here connect.

480
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,420
She's here,
the Shakras are there.

481
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,640
Oh,
I was smothered in all this stuff.

482
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:15,320
So there's this sort of like this sort 
of,

483
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,173
the other component of orientalism is a 
software Western fetishization of a and 

484
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:22,950
possibly a reductively of,
uh,

485
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:28,230
of Hindu ideology or vedic knowledge.
And so no,

486
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,973
but do you think that there is a genuine
value that can be useful in a sort of 

487
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,593
postmodern?

488
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,303
Far Too much easy mockery and criticism 
of people who look to all the cultures 

489
00:28:46,451 --> 00:28:48,100
or,
or ancient philosophies,

490
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,110
whether in Asia or elsewhere in Africa 
or,

491
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,953
or Latin America or the Americas.
Because what they are looking for is an 

492
00:28:57,621 --> 00:28:58,454
alternative to a way of being,
to a civilization that feels too much 

493
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:07,010
like a trap to them.
And I think,

494
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:07,844
you know,
people in the 60s or went out to places 

495
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:14,300
like India and joined various 
countercultural moments,

496
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,280
most famously the Beatles.
And I know there was so many,

497
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:18,114
they were literally hundreds of 
thousands of people who went out there 

498
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,463
looking for an alternative to this.
So less mechanical society that they 

499
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:29,344
were living in,
which was at that time in the 1960s 

500
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:37,110
engaged in a catastrophic violent war in
Vietnam and indies elsewhere.

501
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,810
So there was a lot of disillusionment 
back then,

502
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,063
which made people look for some kind of 
a spiritual and moral possibility 

503
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,343
elsewhere.

504
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,880
And I think that impulse is important,
that impulse,

505
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,600
which can mislead.
And he did mislead a lot of people,

506
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,600
uh,
into joining all kinds of crazy sex,

507
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,730
um,
being cornered by various gurus who were

508
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:05,820
just waiting for these gullible people 
to show up.

509
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,203
But I think it's really important to 
understand why these people went out 

510
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:15,781
there and that it's also important to 
understand that there is a lot of value.

511
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,313
There is,
there are many things of value in these 

512
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:21,670
traditions.
These are these,

513
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:22,504
this is,
this is how human beings lived for 

514
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:24,664
centuries and centuries.
We would be foolish to discard the 

515
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:29,950
wisdom contained in those traditions and
philosophies.

516
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,220
How do we utilize it,
do you imagine?

517
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,570
Because,
uh,

518
00:30:35,571 --> 00:30:36,404
of course this is wisdom premised on a 
very different time on different 

519
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,880
conditions,
but I sense that morally and spiritually

520
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:47,714
there's a value in it.
Can it like in defiance of the essence 

521
00:30:51,711 --> 00:30:52,544
of secularism,
do these spiritual models have 

522
00:30:56,151 --> 00:31:01,151
information that ought be utilized in 
the establishment of new social systems?

523
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:02,450
In your opinion?

524
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,870
You know,
someone like the Dalai Lama,

525
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:07,150
who,
who I rate very highly,

526
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,260
who is a Buddhist,
but when he goes around the world,

527
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,320
he insists that he's not really talking 
about Buddhism.

528
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,780
He's talking about compassion,
the importance of compassion.

529
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,200
So He's coming from an ancient religious
tradition.

530
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,670
He's completely immersed in it.
He's using that language,

531
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,620
but he's not saying that you have to 
become a Buddhist.

532
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,833
You have to convert to my way of life.
He's saying these are some of the 

533
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:39,501
principles outlined,
embraced by human beings a long time ago

534
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:40,904
and since then followed by hundreds of 
millions of people and they have been 

535
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,803
hugely,
hugely important and making possible 

536
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,033
contented lives.
So you have to think about this as an 

537
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:53,624
alternative to these stress stouts,
intolerable lives that you're leading 

538
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:00,254
out there,
which is causing all kinds of 

539
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,640
psychological disorders.
So I think you know,

540
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,560
when you start thinking about it in 
these pragmatic ways,

541
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:15,010
when you shed this baggage of religious 
tradition or spiritual tradition,

542
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:17,983
when again,
you think about the basic building 

543
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:23,550
blocks of human society,
compassion and solidarity,

544
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,940
those resources you can find in many 
different religious traditions including

545
00:32:29,101 --> 00:32:29,790
those in the west.

546
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,160
I think it's really important too to 
realize it.

547
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,080
Western Europe,
the United States,

548
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,930
is it cell full of those vital 
traditions.

549
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,190
When you talk about the basic building

550
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,023
blocks of human society or so of course 
talking about the basic building blocks 

551
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:48,770
of a human being and a the,
if these energies,

552
00:32:48,771 --> 00:32:53,771
these Schumer's these components of a 
human being include compassion,

553
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:55,370
kindness,
community,

554
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:57,610
togetherness,
Union Union and yearning,

555
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,560
at least for the,
for the last few things I mentioned,

556
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,590
then these are,
uh,

557
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,053
perhaps I favorable resource to under 
route raw underwrite our social systems 

558
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:09,823
compared to these sort of individualism 
that has become rampant and is leading 

559
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:14,864
into deterioration is something I've 
brought up several times in this 

560
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:18,980
podcast.
I'd like to know what you think about it

561
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:23,981
in the moment prior to Indian 
independence from Britain,

562
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,053
Gandy said that there's no point in us 
replacing the British merely to emulate 

563
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:32,060
them and to maintain their systems.
I'm sure you're aware.

564
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,043
And as it was,
he said he spoke sort of that 60 70 

565
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:36,860
years ago whenever it was said like 
that,

566
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:38,600
you know that this is a country of 
70,000

567
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:39,170
villages.

568
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,003
All of them should be the PA perhaps 
into dependent but autonomous and free 

569
00:33:44,841 --> 00:33:46,660
and,
and he set that sort of like that,

570
00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:47,494
you know,
so it was talked in a way about sort of 

571
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:52,730
a decentralized social system.
And he also talks about,

572
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,420
and I've not mentioned this is march 
something,

573
00:33:55,421 --> 00:33:56,254
but he said people will have to to some 
degree let go of their need for 

574
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:02,240
commodification.
There need to consume.

575
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:07,241
And it seems sort of again,
sort of a as ear really perspicacious to

576
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:08,354
hear someone talk about,
you can't be obsessed with your iphone 

577
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:15,440
for half a century prior to that,
that kind of technology being available.

578
00:34:15,441 --> 00:34:19,610
But it seemed to me very pertinent.
But there is that we have to let go.

579
00:34:19,611 --> 00:34:20,444
This a narrative of progressivism that 
keeps coming up is aligned to the 

580
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:25,934
liberal idea of individual freedom,
which is aligned to consuming to make 

581
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:32,840
yourself happy and at some point where 
the rubber meets the road,

582
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,940
individual human beings like me.
And you said earlier,

583
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:39,110
we are sort of prisoners of comfort,
addicted to the privileges that the last

584
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:42,630
2030 years is afforded us.
At some point does it,

585
00:34:42,631 --> 00:34:43,464
it boils down to us saying we've got 
just have less stuff and we've got to 

586
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:48,990
let go of it.
It's not working for us.

587
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:53,890
And that might be a component of 
building different kinds of societies.

588
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,671
Absolutely.
I mean,

589
00:34:54,671 --> 00:34:55,151
I think,
you know,

590
00:34:55,151 --> 00:34:55,984
socialism for a long time carried many 
of the impulses leftover from faded 

591
00:35:03,111 --> 00:35:06,510
Christianity feeling of compassion,
uh,

592
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,940
charity justice.
Okay.

593
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,600
When social socialism ones realized in 
certain countries,

594
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,673
again,
because socialism became all about 

595
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,850
material growth,
material progress,

596
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,330
these values were systematically 
disregarded.

597
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,710
But I think it's really important to 
marry socialist ideas,

598
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,590
primarily those of compassion,
equality,

599
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,160
justice to this regard for the 
environment.

600
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,233
Nature recognition of kind.
Gandhi had very early on in the 1920s 

601
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:40,651
and thirties.
I mean,

602
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:41,484
he was early figure of the green 
movement that the earth does not have 

603
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,760
enough resources to fulfill all the 
greedy desires we have for,

604
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,553
uh,
gadgets failed or amenities for life 

605
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,603
that we have to learn and practice.
The virtue of renunciation is that that 

606
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:07,040
is a very,
very important,

607
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,890
uh,
value for the society we live in.

608
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:13,340
And again,
this is not someone talking in a vacuum.

609
00:36:13,341 --> 00:36:14,174
This is someone,
and this is an aspect of him that's 

610
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:16,603
elected.
This is the one who has lived in three 

611
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:21,580
continents before the first world war.
He's lived in Africa,

612
00:36:21,581 --> 00:36:23,560
he's lived in India,
he's lived in Europe.

613
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:28,570
This is the man with a wide experience 
of world that has been globalized during

614
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:29,660
his time.
Yes.

615
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,580
He,
he understands that this model,

616
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,490
it's essentially it's premised on 
violence.

617
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,783
Yes.
He can see that because he's living 

618
00:36:38,581 --> 00:36:41,430
under imperialism.
He sees the,

619
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,330
okay,

620
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,720
violence is at the core of this whole 
process.

621
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:50,270
And that is why India cannot afford to 
follow this path.

622
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,940
And,
and you know,

623
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,773
he,
he did say that we don't want to 

624
00:36:54,051 --> 00:36:55,460
essentially,
uh,

625
00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:00,530
replace rule by rule of the Englishman 
by English Raj.

626
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,593
Yeah.
So we need to think again about what 

627
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:06,284
kind of society we want for ourselves 
because following this model of and 

628
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:16,770
growth consumption oriented growth is 
going to lead us into an impasse.

629
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,550
This concealed violence,
uh,

630
00:37:21,551 --> 00:37:22,211
the,
this,

631
00:37:22,211 --> 00:37:22,760
uh,
the,

632
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,593
the necessity of this model to conceal 
it's means and its motives is something 

633
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,050
addressed by Marxist theory.
And it's,

634
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,063
I suppose predicate it simply on the 
idea that you can't have limitless 

635
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:40,600
growth if you've got limited resources 
in the end,

636
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,240
this will not even in the end sit 
clinically.

637
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,223
This will lead to crisis.
So capitalism at its heart needs to 

638
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:52,000
conceal both its means and its motives.
Um,

639
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,480
that at its core there is a kind of 
nihilism and like,

640
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,070
well,
we don't care which is going to carry on

641
00:37:57,071 --> 00:37:57,920
doing.
It doesn't matter.

642
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:58,754
I don't think about it.
Sort of a sort of a weird psychopathic 

643
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,980
modus operandi.
Um,

644
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,803
it's interesting to me that you sort of 
spoke of a kind of an emergent sense of 

645
00:38:10,311 --> 00:38:12,710
nihilism.
And the despair that we experienced as a

646
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:13,544
result of this nihilism because 
precisely because we are beginning to 

647
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:20,800
experience while continue while we're 
continue,

648
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,030
while the lie is sort of still sort of 
propped up with a by quantitative easing

649
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,840
or are compliant media new iphone 
upgrade.

650
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,011
Yeah,
yeah,

651
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:30,844
yeah.
I mean I take them whenever they're 

652
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:32,284
offered.
No,

653
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,750
I'm not the one I found 10 now.
Yeah.

654
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,090
The,
these continues to be concealed.

655
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,193
So,

656
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,840
uh,
well what I'm asking I suppose

657
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,993
is La,

658
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,020
where will,

659
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,260
where do you,
like you,

660
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,330
you,
you saying that it will lead to impasse,

661
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:52,420
but it's perhaps likely that this rage 
will lead somewhere

662
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,320
darker.
Do you,

663
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,840
where do you envisage it?
Well,

664
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:56,683
you know,
in many ways the solutions to many of 

665
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:03,000
the problems that exist today,
political problems,

666
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:05,130
economic problems,
inequality,

667
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,053
dysfunction,
that pretty obvious if you're diagnosed 

668
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:10,150
the problem correctly,
the problems,

669
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:10,690
the,
the,

670
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,070
the prescriptions of the solutions 
would,

671
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,960
would emerge naturally from that.
The problem really is the,

672
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,183
whether anyone or any party,
any movement has the political will to 

673
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,500
do it.
The establishment at present,

674
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,640
whether in,
in,

675
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:25,474
in Europe or in America.
I do not think it's capable of charting 

676
00:39:29,641 --> 00:39:33,330
a new path of leading us out of this 
impasse.

677
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,280
Marsha depends on social movements,
on political movements,

678
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,340
on the energy,
intellectual dynamism,

679
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,213
dynamism of young people who are 
entering public life for the first time 

680
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,150
with new ideas,
with no prejudices,

681
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,080
no fantasies about themselves,
about their imperialist past and,

682
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:53,611
and,
and,

683
00:39:53,611 --> 00:39:54,100
and,
and,

684
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,160
and what their ancestors achieved in the
second world war and so on.

685
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,730
And these are people that we should look
to us.

686
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,560
I mean,
I feel like my generation was a,

687
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,270
was a failure.
Um,

688
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:05,440
I'm in,
I'm in now,

689
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,303
um,
uh,

690
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,780
approaching my,
my,

691
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:08,980
uh,
um,

692
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,023
late forties,
and I feel that my generation was too 

693
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:13,504
much in thrall to these notions of 
universal progress and growth that 

694
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:23,821
started to be globalized back off back 
in the late eighties,

695
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,793
early nineties.
And it's a generation that has not been 

696
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:34,580
intoxicated by this kind of thinking.
Yes,

697
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,400
that's very experienced,
is different,

698
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,660
is very,
is very distinctly,

699
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,673
is one,
should never underestimate the power of 

700
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:46,010
a generation remake or young generation 
to remake the world.

701
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:46,810
Okay.

702
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,643
Curious the identity and fluidity,
a PA to be sort of a determining 

703
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,280
component of the younger generation 
where they don't want to be labeled.

704
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,760
They either around sexuality and 
identity.

705
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:01,594
There is a sort of,
there is a sort of a new fluidity that 

706
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:08,851
bodes well for transitioning and change 
on a social and political.

707
00:41:08,951 --> 00:41:10,000
I think it's fantastic.
I mean,

708
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:10,690
I think,
you know,

709
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,830
all our rigid categories,
um,

710
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,930
masculine,
feminine for instance.

711
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,960
I mean we've been,
we've been experiencing now for the last

712
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,590
few months,
this sort of explosion of,

713
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,483
um,
stories about this whole culture of 

714
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:30,700
oppression that has existed in the heart
of the modern world.

715
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,563
Again,
something that used to be blamed 

716
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:36,860
exclusively on Islam or religion,
the oppression of women,

717
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:40,450
the exploitation of women.
And now we see a,

718
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,120
it,
it,

719
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,953
it,
there's pathology existing in the 

720
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,760
citadel.
Absolutely.

721
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,200
Uh,
within corporate cultures.

722
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:53,230
You know,
and I think what it is telling us that,

723
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,860
uh,
lot of this oppression is systemic.

724
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,500
Yeah.
These,

725
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:03,220
it's premised on these rigid separations
of,

726
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,530
of you know,
mescaline roles,

727
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,383
feminine rules and this identity 
blurring and fluidity that we sue today 

728
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,970
is an attempt,
whether it's deliberate or not,

729
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,433
it's certainly a very admirable,
is trying to transcend these categories 

730
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,300
that actually create oppressive 
conditions for,

731
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:24,290
for many,
many people.

732
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,720
That's brilliant insight.
Thank you very much.

733
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,870
That means to ask you a few more sort 
of,

734
00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:30,704
uh,
questions that relate to your work and 

735
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,680
sort of bring us to this pretty salient.
The,

736
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,280
we touched on the recent recent amount.
Am I saying it correct?

737
00:42:42,281 --> 00:42:43,720
I really liked that.
Um,

738
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,190
what's,
uh,

739
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,103
like can you unpack the kick card aspect
of that day to turn the kicker God used 

740
00:42:50,771 --> 00:42:52,810
and how it relates to terrorism?

741
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,983
I think,
you know,

742
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:54,883
um,
for Kierkegaard [inaudible] was 

743
00:42:58,311 --> 00:43:03,311
something that emerges when individuals 
are made to think that they are equal.

744
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,143
Okay.
Why did the same time they confront the 

745
00:43:13,951 --> 00:43:17,360
fact the brute fact structural 
inequality.

746
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,040
So it's this collision between the 
feeling that you're equal,

747
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:28,140
that you all have the same opportunities
that you are in the same social level,

748
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:33,320
and then you encounter the fact that 
some people are much better off,

749
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:38,110
that there are structural injustices at 
work,

750
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:43,111
historical injustices at work that make 
some people more privileged than others.

751
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:46,903
He diagnosed this as a problem peculiar 
to modern society because societies in 

752
00:43:50,391 --> 00:43:54,080
the past did not uphold the quality as 
an ideal or as a value.

753
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,590
These are hierarchical societies.
Okay.

754
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:01,850
[inaudible] know they did not think 
about instituting equality as an idea.

755
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,470
It's more than society that thinks of 
equality as a central idea,

756
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,873
but at the same time,
because of the process of 

757
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:14,803
industrialization,
because of all these other things that 

758
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:18,074
start to happen in the 19th century and 
kick your God is writing in the 19th 

759
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:21,710
century,
in the mid 19th century,

760
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:22,903
he can see that there's a contradiction 
opening up between the promise of 

761
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:31,631
equality between the promise of freedom 
and the growth of institutions that deny

762
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,420
people equality and freedom.

763
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:34,763
And it's sin.
That denial that the feeling of the 

764
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,170
[inaudible] germinates Oh,
brilliant.

765
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,200
So he identified a fundamental 
contradiction.

766
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,250
Absolutely,
absolutely.

767
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,173
Sorry drew.
So although he did not use the word 

768
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,690
resulting more,
um,

769
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,371
but he,
he,

770
00:44:49,371 --> 00:44:50,204
he,
he did point to some central 

771
00:44:52,461 --> 00:44:53,294
contradictions in the modern project 
that what we are trying to achieve will 

772
00:44:58,691 --> 00:44:59,524
not be achieved because there are some,
there is something just intrinsically 

773
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,160
contradictory about pursuing equality in
a society where competition,

774
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,140
vanity,
imitation,

775
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,520
our values and ideas,

776
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:18,683
these values I find personally very 
punishing and I experienced all of them 

777
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,163
quite deeply.
Vanity plays a big role in my life and 

778
00:45:28,741 --> 00:45:29,574
has done and it's something I'm very 
aware of and I'm trying to diminish his 

779
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:32,634
role.
Competition is a not good feeling to 

780
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:37,380
feel I'm not good enough.
I have to be better than these people,

781
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,360
these,
these models.

782
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,194
I expect that when I like,
cause one of the reason I started doing 

783
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:43,014
this a podcast is because I go to the,
so as university in London doing a 

784
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:49,010
degree in religion in global politics.
Really?

785
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:50,123
Yeah.
And at the moment I'm doing a module of 

786
00:45:51,451 --> 00:45:54,570
a sort of the,
the roots of the traditions of yoga.

787
00:45:54,571 --> 00:45:56,600
So it's looking at a lot of vedic texts,
your pan,

788
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,780
upanishads,
et cetera.

789
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:58,973
And whenever I'm listening to the 
lectures or reason about it and I sort 

790
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:04,980
of have been doing this generally across
the course,

791
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,710
I feel like what does this matter to 
mean now?

792
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,710
What do these values mean to me right 
now in this room,

793
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,360
in this world,
on this planet,

794
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,490
in these systems right now.
And get it.

795
00:46:14,491 --> 00:46:17,970
Cause I can see the impact of vanity.
I can see the failure of narcissism,

796
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,893
I'm experiencing it.
I'm experiencing the failure of 

797
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:21,354
consumerism.
I'm seeing the way that I'm inhibited 

798
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:24,563
and limited by these ideas.
A moment ago you said like if you 

799
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:33,771
correctly diagnose the problem,
then the prescription becomes obvious,

800
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:35,790
which is a pretty cool catch me 
actually.

801
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,950
I reckon you should start pushing that.
Uh,

802
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,153
so,
um,

803
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,593
what,
what do you diagnose as the problem and 

804
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,363
is it like with all of these 
complexities and on the scale that we 

805
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:49,110
now live with,
which is,

806
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:49,621
you know,
glide,

807
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:50,454
but globalization,
whether you regard it as pejorative as 

808
00:46:53,461 --> 00:46:55,860
it now generally is,
or positives,

809
00:46:55,861 --> 00:46:57,990
it was just a 10,
15 years ago.

810
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,183
How do,
how does one come up with a central 

811
00:47:01,781 --> 00:47:03,370
universal solutions too?

812
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,293
Well,
the probably isn't a central university 

813
00:47:05,261 --> 00:47:06,560
tuition.
I mean I think uh,

814
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,940
it's probably a mistake to look for 
central university,

815
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:10,774
the solution right now because the 
problem you could say was in thinking 

816
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:19,900
that there is a universal model of 
progress.

817
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:25,470
The fact that all of us wherever we are 
have to device ideas,

818
00:47:25,931 --> 00:47:30,460
solutions for our societies,
the nectar too.

819
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,280
Okay.
Real experience of her circumstances off

820
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:36,650
the actual physical,
geographical,

821
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,513
political,
historical conditions that'd be inherit 

822
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,700
this can only mean forms of devolution.
Decentralization.

823
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,080
Yes.
You know,

824
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,170
it,
it the,

825
00:47:46,171 --> 00:47:49,280
the implications of this diagnosis in,
in,

826
00:47:49,281 --> 00:47:50,690
in,
in many different realms.

827
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,860
Um,
so you know,

828
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,670
politically we have to think more about 
decentralization.

829
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,190
We have to think about people being 
empowered,

830
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:01,820
people feeling that they are in control 
of their lives.

831
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:06,160
So what do you make of people like on 
the left that say that without some form

832
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:11,161
of dominant state power there will the,
the,

833
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:11,951
the,
the,

834
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:12,784
the,
the idea of anarchy is a pejorative or 

835
00:48:15,341 --> 00:48:17,650
negative state emerges like that,
you know,

836
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:18,484
when I sort of say look cause for a 
while and some of these conversations 

837
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,064
I've got,
it seems like the like are our 

838
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,680
requirements and our needs are so 
diverse.

839
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:26,950
We need the power to be as close as 
possible to the people that are affected

840
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:29,020
by that power.
People should run their own workplaces,

841
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,420
their own hospitals,
their own schools,

842
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:34,150
their own communities and power.
She'll be devolved,

843
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:38,430
decentralized wherever possible.
And what the feedback I've had from sofa

844
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,313
as suppose in know traditional leftist 
thinkers and some people that are very 

845
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,340
much respect and admire is that without 
some authority,

846
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,670
some sort of state or far even without 
some kind of central power,

847
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,730
these projects we'll foul.
Can you send it?

848
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,720
I can understand that concern because 
you know,

849
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:54,603
um,
something that has been said over and 

850
00:48:57,131 --> 00:48:57,964
over again in the last 20,
30 years of new liberalism is that the 

851
00:49:00,221 --> 00:49:01,054
state needs to step back and let's 
essentially society be governed 

852
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:07,440
according to market principles.
Yes.

853
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,753
So there is very good reason to be 
suspicious of that argument which wants 

854
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:17,991
to roll back the role of government in 
protecting the weak and the vulnerable.

855
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,133
Yes,
yes.

856
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,830
And giving ceding power to market forces
and we know who benefits from,

857
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,710
from uh,
the free play of market forces.

858
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:28,263
At the same time,
I think a history has shown repeatedly 

859
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,620
that states when invested with too much 
power,

860
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,530
toning into oppressive,
impersonal bureaucracies,

861
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,800
that is the experience of many 
communists states,

862
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:47,080
eastern European states.
And so we have to be careful.

863
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:47,914
We have to strike a balance between a 
state that is responsive to it's 

864
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,704
citizens that doesn't a choir and a not 
Thomas' life that doesn't stop living 

865
00:49:59,141 --> 00:50:03,240
for itself.
So we have to,

866
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,450
there has to be a role for the state.
At the same time,

867
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,840
citizens have to feel that the decisions
they are taking,

868
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:17,370
the people they are choosing as their 
representatives are responsive to them.

869
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,373
Okay.
That they are in a politically 

870
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:22,363
functional society.
I think what we have today is a deeply 

871
00:50:25,831 --> 00:50:28,620
dysfunctional political society.
Okay.

872
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,750
Yes.
Evidently.

873
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,960
What do you think of like a new heroes 
of the left's,

874
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,100
uh,
Jeremy Corbyn,

875
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:38,934
this country,
Bernie Sanders that know if that's 

876
00:50:40,381 --> 00:50:41,214
relevant anymore in America or would be 
in the next election cycle if that's 

877
00:50:44,101 --> 00:50:45,540
already something that's over and done 
with,

878
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:50,010
Eh,
do you think that within the conditions,

879
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:52,500
the democratic conditions as we 
currently find them,

880
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,440
that they would be able to represent 
people's interest?

881
00:50:55,441 --> 00:50:56,950
This is recent.
Like Jeremy Corbyn,

882
00:50:56,951 --> 00:50:58,860
Sam Morgan Stanley should be afraid,
you know,

883
00:50:58,861 --> 00:50:59,600
like,
do you,

884
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,820
do you think that there is,
to coin the author,

885
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,320
use the name of the movement,
the backs,

886
00:51:04,321 --> 00:51:06,780
Corbyn genuine momentum in that 
direction?

887
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:10,020
Do you think that with within democracy 
as we have it in this country,

888
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:11,323
the,
that he would be empowered to take 

889
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,850
action in that direction?

890
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:16,680
You know,
I think I'm more interested in,

891
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,630
in the movements then.
Then in actual personalities.

892
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:23,880
I think it's remarkable that within a 
few months,

893
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,023
eh,
massive movements consisting largely of 

894
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,713
very young people politicize young 
people came together and became a huge 

895
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:34,574
presence in British politics.
That to me is more important than you 

896
00:51:38,631 --> 00:51:39,101
know,
the,

897
00:51:39,101 --> 00:51:40,910
the,
the play of individuals.

898
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:41,360
I mean,
you know,

899
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,193
Jeremy Corban is a,
is an important figure in that he was 

900
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:47,660
the one who crystallize a popular 
feeling,

901
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,870
a feeling that was not being articulated
by certainly not the press,

902
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,383
not by a commentators.
He managed to recognize that a lot of 

903
00:51:56,331 --> 00:51:58,940
people in this country for ready for 
change,

904
00:51:58,941 --> 00:52:02,780
for new ways of thinking.
Now whether he is politically successful

905
00:52:02,781 --> 00:52:05,630
or not,
the important thing is that he's already

906
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:06,464
created a movement is already affected.
It dramatic shifts in how people think 

907
00:52:11,771 --> 00:52:12,604
about

908
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,560
what should be done here.
Yes.

909
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:19,270
But part of my question,
pancake is what within democracy,

910
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:24,010
as we currently experience it as it 
exists now,

911
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:29,070
would a political party led by Corbyn or
someone of a similar sensibility be able

912
00:52:29,561 --> 00:52:30,394
to enact the will of the people?
Or would there be too much bureaucratic 

913
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:33,723
and systemic resistance and eh,
and it does the state with the have 

914
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:45,660
sufficient power to confront eg 
transnational corporations.

915
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,293
You know,
the odds are stacked against 'em anyone 

916
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:49,794
trying to affect any movement,
any individual trying to affect radical 

917
00:52:54,281 --> 00:52:59,240
change in this society especially,
which is a very conservative society,

918
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:00,283
uh,
where all kinds of ancient powers are 

919
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,560
entrenched.
Okay.

920
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,480
Unlike most societies in Europe,
which experience revolution experienced,

921
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,023
um,
some kind of national upheaval that's 

922
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,350
overturn the old order,
introduce new elements,

923
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,940
we have to recognize that Britain never 
really had a revolution.

924
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:25,150
So Brandon,
pretty unique.

925
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,030
Think that's extremely,
I mean,

926
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:28,080
it's,
it's singular.

927
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,530
Russia had one,
France has a American side one.

928
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,500
What did you watch Germany's then the 
failure of the Second World War?

929
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:35,543
Well,
Joe Jones went through all kinds of 

930
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:37,471
traumas.
You know,

931
00:53:37,471 --> 00:53:41,700
even even before the Second World War.
So first one went very good.

932
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:42,770
I mean they,
they,

933
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:43,603
they had to unify.
They had to sort of create a nation 

934
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:47,670
state in the first place in,
in the,

935
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:48,780
in the 19th century.

936
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,213
Britain is really unique and one reason 
British politics has been so different 

937
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,314
from everywhere else.
What has remained conservative for such 

938
00:53:57,721 --> 00:54:00,540
a long time and why,
you know,

939
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:05,550
a certain kind of English,
upper class landowning aristocracy still

940
00:54:06,091 --> 00:54:11,091
exercises enormous influence here.
This is unprecedented,

941
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:12,923
really unprecedented.
And in the entire world you can't think 

942
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:17,154
of any other country with that kind of 
institutional power invested in 

943
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:27,180
traditional elites.
How fascinating.

944
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:32,240
So I say we're in a unique society.
This is why someone,

945
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,300
you know,
uh,

946
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,133
venturing on a radical project of 
political economic transformation is up 

947
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:42,810
against it.
I mean,

948
00:54:42,811 --> 00:54:43,970
there's no point in,
in,

949
00:54:43,971 --> 00:54:44,570
in,
you know,

950
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:45,403
uh,
being overly optimistic by the one has 

951
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:51,240
to recognize that there are formidable 
challenges.

952
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,163
Head.
Do you think that the role of religion 

953
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:56,123
may be as if not more important as 
politics as we understand it in any 

954
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:04,770
significant social change?

955
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,440
Well,
if you're talking about Britain,

956
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:08,363
you know,
the role of religion has been declining 

957
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:12,323
so dramatically,
so rapidly that one can't really think 

958
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:16,014
of it as a,
as a sort of political factor really 

959
00:55:18,841 --> 00:55:19,674
anymore.
Religion remains a alive in other 

960
00:55:24,181 --> 00:55:25,014
societies,
but unfortunately once religion is 

961
00:55:27,151 --> 00:55:30,510
mobilized as a political force,
beny turns into ideology,

962
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:34,590
then it moves away from what people are 
talking about earlier.

963
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:38,640
This belief in a transcendental 
authority,

964
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,790
which in many ways is a source of 
constellation,

965
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:43,700
a source of peace.
Uh,

966
00:55:43,701 --> 00:55:44,020
it,
it,

967
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:44,853
it pacifies many people,
it makes them more kind and 

968
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:48,894
compassionate.
But when religion is used as an 

969
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:52,890
ideology,
as a way of mobilizing people,

970
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,473
it is inevitably a recipe for conflict.
Because then what people want to do is 

971
00:55:59,221 --> 00:55:59,911
to say,
well,

972
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:04,080
this community or this particular group 
does not belong.

973
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,513
Yes,
that is isn't conflict and violence 

974
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,060
isn't conflict.

975
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:14,060
Certainly in violence regrettably and 
necessary component in radical change,

976
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,560
probably not violence.
You know,

977
00:56:19,561 --> 00:56:20,394
there are,
there are instances of societies which 

978
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,553
have recovered from great violence and 
rebuild themselves through largely 

979
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,560
nonviolent means.
There has been conflict.

980
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,560
Inevitably there'll be conflict because 
the old guard is,

981
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:36,341
is,
is,

982
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:39,910
is not going to let go of it's Baba.
I mean,

983
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:40,744
you know,
power never really concedes anything 

984
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,293
unless you make stern demands on it.
So there is inevitably going to be 

985
00:56:48,711 --> 00:56:51,110
conflict.
But violence,

986
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,003
um,
I think violence can unleash a cycle 

987
00:56:56,130 --> 00:57:00,520
where we will,
you know,

988
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,373
continue to employ violent means to 
pursue your ends and inflict more on 

989
00:57:07,171 --> 00:57:09,660
more damage on the social fabric of 
society.

990
00:57:09,661 --> 00:57:10,250
I mean,
this is,

991
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:11,083
you know,
this has been the experience of many 

992
00:57:11,821 --> 00:57:12,654
societies.
Bishop hired violent revolutions and 

993
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,493
undermine themselves and took a long 
time for them to recover from that kind 

994
00:57:20,821 --> 00:57:22,410
of prime of violence.
Yeah.

995
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:27,660
Nonviolence as a method for protest for 
like,

996
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,583
you know,
when you're talking about sort of the 

997
00:57:30,211 --> 00:57:31,810
old guard and the resistance of the old 
guard,

998
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:34,230
you can see that there's these 
entrenched,

999
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:37,270
and you said ancient powers in this 
country you referring to,

1000
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:40,710
but you know,
can see sort of even modern or authority

1001
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,460
that refuses to yield.
Uh,

1002
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:45,930
like that.
One of the,

1003
00:57:45,931 --> 00:57:46,764
you said like the last time there was a 
huge civil unrest or like are around 

1004
00:57:51,121 --> 00:57:51,954
identity politics around sort of an 
empowerment of you for at the Marne for 

1005
00:57:55,501 --> 00:58:00,501
change different ideas was the 60s and 
we saw by the nonviolence huge component

1006
00:58:01,531 --> 00:58:05,160
of that I suppose between in a way,
because it would probably because of the

1007
00:58:05,161 --> 00:58:10,161
infusion of sort of different ae,
eastern mystic or to Luther King and the

1008
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,270
influence on Martin Luther King of 
Gandy.

1009
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:15,800
Very direct and explicit and expressed.
And uh,

1010
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:16,723
I know,
and I suppose because it was being 

1011
00:58:17,401 --> 00:58:18,234
counter post with such obvious domestic 
violence in the United States against 

1012
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:26,340
the African American population in 
violence on the young men and women that

1013
00:58:26,341 --> 00:58:29,760
have incentive Vietnam to fight.
So I suppose it seemed like an eh,

1014
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,990
evident and obvious.
And it though,

1015
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,610
I wonder if,
uh,

1016
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:39,090
I wonder if you can envisage mass 
movements towards decentralization.

1017
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,290
There's something sort of contradictory 
about it,

1018
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:46,450
but that people coming together 
achieving solidarity to demand the right

1019
00:58:46,451 --> 00:58:50,830
to be autonomous,
to demand the dismantling of centralized

1020
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,980
interest institutions that prevent 
people having real purchase,

1021
00:58:53,981 --> 00:58:55,330
real power,
real purpose.

1022
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,740
You know,
there are instances of,

1023
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,500
um,
movements for decentralization,

1024
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:02,330
which turned into secessionist 
movements,

1025
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:05,410
sometimes inevitably such as,
um,

1026
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:06,283
cartoon.
Yeah.

1027
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,360
Um,
people,

1028
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:10,460
a lot of people in Hong Kong for 
instance,

1029
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:13,400
they want the freedom to run their own 
affairs.

1030
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,450
Um,
you will,

1031
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:15,343
you could argue that large numbers of 
people in Scotland want to be free of a 

1032
00:59:19,311 --> 00:59:24,311
country that is hurtling a disaster,
but a disaster spot too.

1033
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:25,454
It's brexit.
So right now we see more cessationists 

1034
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,440
tendencies,
you know,

1035
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:36,260
which are a kind of replacement for a 
movement.

1036
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:41,050
That means what,
just sort of breaking away from existing

1037
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:42,110
nation state

1038
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:46,910
structures and forming an independent 
sovereign nation state.

1039
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:47,803
Why it doesn't,
it doesn't solve the problem of 

1040
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:50,683
centralization

1041
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:51,500
there.
And why,

1042
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,333
like under those terms,
couldn't brexit be regarded as quite a 

1043
00:59:54,181 --> 00:59:55,014
positive thing if we're talking about 
decentralization or do you see the 

1044
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,250
European Union is largely benevolent in 
confront,

1045
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:04,890
in economics to be made from the left

1046
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,210
for Brexit?
Yes.

1047
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,810
I've always believed that,
um,

1048
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:10,930
it was never made,
nobody bothered to make it.

1049
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:12,400
Um,
the fact that,

1050
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:13,363
um,
Britain should exercise greater 

1051
01:00:16,601 --> 01:00:21,601
sovereignty and should not have 
decisions made by mobile global capital.

1052
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:24,943
You know,
I think we have to understand the 

1053
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:27,103
impulse behind these apparently 
kilometers phenomenal like brexit or 

1054
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:36,554
trump,
which is essentially people really do 

1055
01:00:39,141 --> 01:00:40,970
want to take back control.
Yes.

1056
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,190
The people promising control to them 
happened to be at this point,

1057
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:48,443
demagogues core interested in expanding 
their own power and those of their 

1058
01:00:52,771 --> 01:00:54,110
cronies.
Okay.

1059
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:59,640
This does not mean that the platform,
that's the four tone,

1060
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:05,320
which was the idea of taking back 
control is not hugely attractive numbers

1061
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:06,783
of people who really do genuinely want 
to take back into who do want to be 

1062
01:01:10,121 --> 01:01:10,954
empowered,
who do not want their lives to be 

1063
01:01:13,031 --> 01:01:16,990
determined by the impersonal,
abstract forces of,

1064
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:20,080
of capital.
They do want to be repulsed,

1065
01:01:20,081 --> 01:01:22,540
decide their societies to be repleted 
decides that,

1066
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,201
uh,
and,

1067
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:23,531
and,
and,

1068
01:01:23,531 --> 01:01:28,531
and wants economic imperatives or indeed
the imperatives of profit,

1069
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:35,860
corporate profits to override human 
values,

1070
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:40,610
human considerations.
But if it's,

1071
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,130
if,
if the far right or the devil Gawks,

1072
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:47,360
if they are the only ones channeling 
this energy.

1073
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,740
Okay.
Two was their own ends.

1074
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:54,370
Then we end up with these in these 
situations that we are in right now.

1075
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,753
I really,
I think that's a very optimistic 

1076
01:01:57,531 --> 01:01:59,600
analysis.
By don't mean a romantic analysis,

1077
01:01:59,601 --> 01:02:02,390
I think it's quite pragmatic and quite 
powerful.

1078
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:03,680
Uh,
thank you.

1079
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:04,523
I appreciate that.
But when you were saying that if you 

1080
01:02:06,951 --> 01:02:07,784
diagnosed the problem correctly,
then the prescription becomes obvious 

1081
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:13,670
and if indeed we are living in,
let me quote you at the title,

1082
01:02:13,671 --> 01:02:15,350
your book,
age of anger,

1083
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:20,650
then compassion is necessarily the 
prescription compassion for one another.

1084
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:22,640
So I think that,
you know,

1085
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,483
both for honest,
from a spiritual perspective and from a 

1086
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:25,824
practical political perspective,
I think I've learned a great deal from 

1087
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:32,280
this conversation and I can envisage,
I really understood the story,

1088
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:33,114
their philosophical story or historical 
narrative in ways that I haven't before 

1089
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:39,060
and it gave me cause for optimism and 
that,

1090
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:40,740
you know,
I've never been a person that saw brexit

1091
01:02:40,741 --> 01:02:42,990
is a wholly oh negative thing.

1092
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,850
I,
because of the background I come from,

1093
01:02:44,851 --> 01:02:46,860
I have a different attitude towards 
that.

1094
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,753
Sort of the idea of what brexit might 
mean and what people might have meant 

1095
01:02:51,151 --> 01:02:53,310
when they said it.
And that take back power,

1096
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:57,030
take back control as an impulse needn't 
necessarily be,

1097
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:00,330
uh,
aimed at like,

1098
01:03:00,331 --> 01:03:03,210
because we hate these group of people 
because we hate that group of people.

1099
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,283
Uh,
thank you very much for explaining that 

1100
01:03:05,461 --> 01:03:06,271
to me.
Thank you.

1101
01:03:06,271 --> 01:03:09,090
It's been a wonderful conversation.
I really enjoyed it.

1102
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:10,050
Yeah,
me too man.

1103
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:13,230
Thanks Pankaj Mishra.
Thank you very much for coming here.

1104
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,050
Thanks for participating in the skin.
It really enjoyed that.

1105
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:17,633
Likewise.
Good when it know I very much enjoyed 

1106
01:03:20,031 --> 01:03:22,050
that.
There we go.

1107
01:03:22,051 --> 01:03:24,450
That show was sponsored by my book 
recovery,

1108
01:03:24,451 --> 01:03:26,340
which is available now.
You can order it on Amazon.

1109
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:29,610
Also get the audiobook of Audubon.
It was pretty good.

1110
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:32,760
And also come and see me on the rebirth 
tour.

1111
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:35,340
A lot of these ideas are presented in 
succinct,

1112
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,800
amusing,
sometimes disgusting ways.

1113
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,720
Leicester,
December the sixth,

1114
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,600
Newcastle,
14th of December,

1115
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,780
Brixton,
December the 19th.

1116
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,060
And that's it.
And that'll be it for the year.

1117
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,120
So a go russell,

And finally,

1119
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:56,550
just to trouble you a little bit more,
ring a bit more of your life.
