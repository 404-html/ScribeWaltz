00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,013
Hello,
you're listening to under the skin with 

2
00:00:01,651 --> 00:00:02,270
me,
bro.

3
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,130
Nah,
y'all listen to me,

4
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:09,120
Russell brand and I'm talking to 
Professor David.

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,420
I'm assuming professor can drop the 
professor.

6
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:14,170
I don't like it very much.
Oh,

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,120
professor.
Hey.

8
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:17,460
I've come up in the world.
Professor David Harvey.

9
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:22,461
I'll be talking to as if we was equals 
that David Harvey Professor David Harvey

10
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,940
is the world's leading Marxist thing.
Go.

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,330
That's what it says.
See,

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,820
I've just,
I'm just reading the script might,

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,280
I'm just reading the script.
He writes extensively on Marxists,

14
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,630
geography,
social justice,

15
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:34,464
and the political economy and is the 
author of over 20 books including 17 

16
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,274
contradictions in the end of capitalism,
rebel cities and the new imperialism is 

17
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:43,524
a distinguished professor of 
anthropology and geography at the 

18
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:46,914
graduate center of the city,
University of New York and has been 

19
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:52,710
teaching Marx's Kapital for almost 40 
years.

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,890
His new book is titled Marx Capital and 
the Madness of economic reason.

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,920
Professor David Harvey,
Frankie,

22
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:04,260
very much for being our guest on under 
the skin.

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,620
You'll hear somewhat to promote this 
book,

24
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,090
Marx capital and the madness of economic
reason.

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,040
Why you,
why have you written this book?

26
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:14,680
And now?

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,220
Well,
I'm,

28
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,930
I've been involved over several years 
now what I call the mark's project,

29
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:23,931
which is to try to explain to people 
what it was mark's was talking about and

30
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:28,950
to do it in terms which are simple 
without being simplistic.

31
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,993
It's been quite a challenge to do that 
has this marks is kind of a bit of a 

32
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,134
hard read when you first read him.
But a lot of academics spend a lot of 

33
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:39,870
their time trying to make marks more 
complicated than it already is.

34
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,890
So I'm trying to make it simpler so that
people can grasp it.

35
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,320
And I had a series of books which have 
come out.

36
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:49,890
And this is uh,
the last one and it may not be the final

37
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:50,800
one,
but it,

38
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,343
uh,
I tried to put a lot of things together 

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,593
in this book about what the,
what's going on in the three volumes of 

40
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:57,564
capital,
how will they relate to how the three 

41
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:00,444
volumes relate to each other and,
and how coming out of that you get a 

42
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:07,380
picture of capitalist society and the 
essence of what capital is about.

43
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,813
Uh,
so that's what I'm trying to do in the 

44
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,644
book and I'm hoping that people will 
pick it up and read it and give a good 

45
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:14,550
shot at understanding it.

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Given your stated objective of making 
capital more accessible,

47
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,353
perhaps we'll start this conversation 
with a paps illuminating a few simple 

48
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:27,904
terms and ideas.
So I'll go through these questions 

49
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,663
because this is an important topic and 
we've looped into this cause are 

50
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,070
preemptive chat.
I was really getting off on,

51
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,900
but I would like to make sure that we 
build sufficient foundations.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,513
Firstly,
why you're not calling it das kapital 

53
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,130
like how you're supposed to,

54
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,763
um,
well I'm using the English translation 

55
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:52,190
so I usually English language to talk 
about it.

56
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,203
There are some problems about the 
translation and obviously now that's 

57
00:02:58,201 --> 00:02:59,034
what I'm working from.

58
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,260
Hey cause it I suppose because of that 
brief to simplify it.

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,290
Firstly why he's based book so 
important.

60
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,030
I mean capital and though your book and 
think is important as well.

61
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,900
I'm not trying to belittle your book.
I said why is capital and then why is it

62
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:19,734
an important book?
What's in there that's relevant to 

63
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,740
people today in 2017 after we have in 
jewelry,

64
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,850
their idea,
their negative stories about communism.

65
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:30,983
Why is this?
But why is capital one important thing 

66
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,113
for us to understand?
Now,

67
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,860
you know,
capitalism book is not about communism.

68
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,933
Oh it's a,
I was about as a critique of capitalism 

69
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,470
and there's not even a critique of 
capitalism and every respect.

70
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:47,640
It's a,
it's a critique of how,

71
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:50,630
what I would call the engine of 
capitalist development,

72
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,250
uh,
works.

73
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,353
Uh,
how the laws of accumulation of capital 

74
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:59,410
work cause capitalism expansionary 
system is constantly expanding.

75
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,244
And how does it expand and what kind of 
stresses does that do that does that 

76
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:08,900
create amongst working people?
What kind of stresses in relationship to

77
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:09,734
cultural evolution,
what kind of stress is in relationship 

78
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:14,670
to environmental questions and,
and,

79
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,504
and the like.
And we're surrounded obviously with all 

80
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:20,570
of those questions about the 
environment,

81
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:21,404
about cultural preservation,
about even the definition of what it is 

82
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,973
means to be a human being.
They having a big debate about that and 

83
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:32,060
the United States right now because 
everybody looks at trump and says,

84
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:35,330
is that the future of what humanity is 
going to look like?

85
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:36,740
And the answer many people,
there's no,

86
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,270
we got to think of something really 
different.

87
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,540
So,
so with all of those questions around,

88
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,853
uh,
you need to know what it is that is 

89
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:47,510
driving capitalism,
uh,

90
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:50,720
to do the kinds of things it does in 
relationship to exploitation,

91
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,030
the environment,
social inequality,

92
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,970
cultural transformations,
the production of new wants,

93
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:58,280
needs and desires,
all of those sorts of things.

94
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:01,130
We need to have a theory of that.
And Mark's is the first person,

95
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,220
and we're ready to come to terms with 
what that theory might look like

96
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,930
in the 1850s mark's was able to identify
in this critique of capitalism,

97
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,920
what likely trends and what the result 
of capitalism would be.

98
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,530
Even though this is like,
you know,

99
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,613
150 years ago,
that's when the reasons you've written 

100
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:17,151
the book,
isn't it?

101
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:21,740
Even at 150 years ago,
it was able to predict what was it about

102
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:25,600
capitalism then that made it evident 
that this economic system,

103
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,443
well,
first,

104
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,290
first,
first,

105
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,010
and it has to grow.
It has to grow with the,

106
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,610
what we call a compound,
right?

107
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,080
Which is kind of a 3% per year is a 
small amount of,

108
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,200
uh,
new commodities and so on back in 1850.

109
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:45,090
But by the time you get to 2000,
it's a huge amount of new commodities.

110
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,430
So it's got to grow and at some point,
or rather it's gonna hit limits to that.

111
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:50,960
Yeah.

112
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,120
In the end.
That's quite a simple observation.

113
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:54,110
Yeah.
And Mark's made then,

114
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:57,650
because if you change the word 
capitalism to the word elephant,

115
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,100
then

116
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,760
in [inaudible] it is the elephant has to
continue to grow.

117
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,470
It's going to fill the room and kill us 
all.

118
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,270
Like you just pointed out.
Yeah,

119
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,010
no,
it's a,

120
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,630
it's a growth machine and it has to grow
because that's the only way in which you

121
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:13,790
kind of show a profitability profit is 
an access.

122
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,933
Yes.
And they have to produce the access in 

123
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:16,994
order for capital smart and then you 
have to use that access to produce more 

124
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:23,780
access.
So they say it's endless.

125
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:24,614
Accumulation is one of the rules of the 
game necessarily and essentially 

126
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:32,000
impractical filling.
A practical need is about creating needs

127
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:36,140
that are not there order that it might 
continue to have compound growth.

128
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,370
So how come that that observation was 
made in 1850 how covert and then go,

129
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,390
oh yeah,
that's a good point,

130
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,040
right?
Stop this capitalism then.

131
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,230
Well,
because there's plenty of room to expand

132
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:46,064
back in 1850 I mean the rest of the 
world was there and of course we are to 

133
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:49,670
colonialism.

134
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,503
We had imperialism,
we had all of the expansions around the 

135
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,444
world,
so there's plenty of room for that 

136
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,440
growth to occur.
Uh,

137
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,274
there was a,
what I call a capital was getting into 

138
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:02,060
what I call a special fix a lot of the 
time,

139
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:06,170
which is what we're capable of doing.
Super amount of commodities,

140
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,960
uh,
and,

141
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,930
and,
and capacity and Britain.

142
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,390
So I wouldn't know what to do with it.
So,

143
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,453
uh,
the British would lend to Argentina to 

144
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:17,240
build railroads and the railroads will 
be produced in Britain.

145
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,074
So yeah,
so Argentina gets caught into the kind 

146
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:22,640
of the circulation of capital.
So,

147
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,030
so there were plenty of places like that
for capital to grow into.

148
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,740
But now there's no place left.
I mean,

149
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:30,020
maybe Africa still is not completely 
gone,

150
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:33,440
but pretty much everywhere in the world 
has been caught into it right now.

151
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:34,274
So growth from here on out is not 
feasible when it was feasible back in 

152
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:38,180
1850.

153
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:38,661
All right.
So,

154
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:39,770
even if someone has said out in a 
minute,

155
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:40,604
if we have to,
if we have to indefinitely grow this 

156
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:43,244
ideology,
it will necessarily bring about 

157
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:48,060
destruction and the responses I was now 
bie cheese,

158
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,060
no one was bothered.
Well you know,

159
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,010
back then,
uh,

160
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,853
you know United States was only just 
beginning and and yeah they all United 

161
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,230
States,
continent sort of and the North American

162
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:58,064
continent to get to occupy.
Would I be right then in asking David 

163
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,510
and beyond dry and more importantly than
right.

164
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,433
Bloody clever in asking that uh,
that capitalism a sourced from 

165
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,073
imperialism and colonialism is an 
economic model that fits the proceeding 

166
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:12,644
ideology which had been a rather more 
obviously in ethical system of 

167
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:18,080
domination.
Yeah.

168
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,730
I ran a capital has always been about 
geographical expansion.

169
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:23,564
Now,
whether you call it colonialism or you 

170
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:25,784
call imperialism,
I actually prefer to call it and even 

171
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:28,814
geographical development because 
sometimes imperialism makes it is too 

172
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:38,090
simple a term cause cause right now if 
you look at the way in which commodities

173
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:38,751
are made,
you know,

174
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,584
one piece is made in Taiwan and one lady
says made in South Korea and other 

175
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,154
pieces made in Mexico and then it's all 
put together in the United States and 

176
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:48,080
you say,
where is capital in all of this?

177
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,170
So right now it's a much more 
complicated kind of story.

178
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:52,940
So I kind of saying,
well where's,

179
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,800
where's,
where's all this work going?

180
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,200
But she's producing the commodities 
again on our table.

181
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,273
And one of the questions I always like 
to start by geography classes off with 

182
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:05,130
was questions of where does your 
breakfast come from?

183
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,650
And it was kind of really interesting.
People can't go,

184
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,340
oh I never thought about it.
And they,

185
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,370
they kind of say well it comes from the 
supermarket and you had no,

186
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:11,671
no,
no.

187
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:13,650
I want to feel aware there's all this 
stuff come from.

188
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,803
And,
and after about three weeks of asking 

189
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,490
the same question and people will say 
things like,

190
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,423
I didn't have breakfast this morning,
it's now telling me this question but I 

191
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:24,040
don't like this question and I'll let me
my breakfast and no,

192
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,930
I'm not hungry.
More of a puzzle that rain.

193
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,793
When did that crowd the cloud accumulate
and why was that card that I'm not 

194
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,600
coming to your classes anymore.
No,

195
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,970
that's exactly right.
That's how I,

196
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,120
I got a lot of dropouts from my 
geography class cause I kept asking that

197
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:39,954
question.

198
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,750
But in a way a capitalism is a vehicle 
for a particular type of mentality,

199
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,010
which is kind of about what,

200
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,610
well it's uh,
you know,

201
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,250
the famous kind of statement,
the greed is good.

202
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,900
There's that kind of a side bar about 
Ashley.

203
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,910
The mentality now is shifted a bit 
because I think a lot of capitalism is,

204
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,770
is about a complicated relationship with
the data's and I,

205
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,623
one of the things that are talking about
in this last book a lot is the way in 

206
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:14,030
which the future has got foreclosed by 
debt.

207
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,523
Bad debt is a claim on future labor.
And it's a claim on your future library 

208
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,280
and if you heavily in debt,
you've got to pay it off.

209
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,503
So the incentive you have right now is 
not took on is is getting rid of the 

210
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:28,274
debt.
I said

211
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,510
I'm supposed to be rich and I'm in 
slave.

212
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,280
Yeah,
well this is exactly,

213
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:36,180
this is exactly right.
It's about foreclosure and it's about,

214
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:37,014
it's about not emancipating you at all.
It's about imprisoning you in a network 

215
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:44,910
of a debt relations which have become 
very different.

216
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:45,631
That's why,
you know,

217
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,310
student debt,
I'm in states now,

218
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,530
we've got these horrible amount of 
student debt,

219
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,180
which really full close is the future 
for people for new in remarkable ways.

220
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,223
If you couldn't remove morality from the
lens of analysis in a source of 

221
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,570
ingenious in it's mendacity in a number 
of ways in which he dominating.

222
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,080
Yeah.
By the way,

223
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,450
Mark's does not make a moral argument.
No,

224
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,303
it's not a really,
essentially a moral argument they'd 

225
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,743
seize.
It's about the inevitability of 

226
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:14,284
mendacity.

227
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,650
Cool.
[inaudible] bearing might like then,

228
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,690
this is still the simple bit of the 
podcast for me and one to z,

229
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,910
but that is the difference between 
socialism,

230
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Marxism and communism.
Is there a quick way of doing that?

231
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,270
Well,
socialism I think is generally spoken.

232
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:34,104
Alvarez,
a transitional a system and which 

233
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,383
capitalism has put down a sufficient 
constraints so that you have social 

234
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:47,190
democracy and it's,
and I think traditionally it was seen as

235
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:49,320
a stepping stone to full communism 
where,

236
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:54,321
which would lead to the abolition of the
class relation between and labor and the

237
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:56,494
abolition of class privilege.
And eventually of course the abolition 

238
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:03,340
of the capitalist state apparatus.
So communism is seen as something,

239
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,960
a further stage going beyond,
uh,

240
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,491
we're,
we're,

241
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:08,324
whereas under socialism,
elements of the capitalism would still 

242
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:12,454
exist.
The market system was still be their 

243
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:17,650
money of the sort of what we use.
And cumulate was still be there,

244
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:19,810
but under social,
under communism,

245
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:23,260
a lot of that would then disappear.
Marxism,

246
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,060
for me anyway,
is,

247
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,150
is a mode of analysis as a way of 
thinking,

248
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,180
which is a critical way of thinking.

249
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,930
And,
and it,

250
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:32,764
it says to you when he,
when he got some sort of situation and 

251
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:37,540
you want to try to understand what the 
hell is happening,

252
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,790
you don't get to see by surface 
appearances,

253
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,880
you don't get to see it by ideological 
kind of bluster.

254
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,013
You get,
you could do an analysis and for 

255
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:46,444
yourself and you come up with an 
understanding of what's really going on 

256
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:49,744
here.
And when you understand what's really 

257
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:51,484
going on here,
you can then act against what is really 

258
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:54,844
happening in a,
in a deep way rather than simply deal 

259
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:58,720
with surface symptoms.

260
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,530
I see subcutaneous analysis,
not just observation of symptoms.

261
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,083
When you observe the symptoms,
you're necessarily confined by the 

262
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:11,330
argument.
The Arthur.

263
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,230
Yeah.
One of the things mark said was if,

264
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:13,890
if,
if,

265
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,120
uh,
you know,

266
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,580
if everything was as it seemed to be on 
the surface,

267
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:20,770
there will be no need for science.
So we look at the,

268
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,520
we look at the sun and it looks like the
sound's going around the earth,

269
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,290
but we find out,
well it isn't,

270
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,530
you know,
it's rotating.

271
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,650
So I'm just another business.
Write that down.

272
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,460
This is Iowa.
So that's why,

273
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:35,020
that's why mark's means by appearance,
uh,

274
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,840
and,
and then the reality behind it.

275
00:13:36,841 --> 00:13:37,341
So it's,
uh,

276
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:38,370
and,
and you know,

277
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:39,204
most scientists,
I think we recognize there's a 

278
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:43,200
difference between symptoms and you 
know,

279
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,290
what the underlying causes and those 
medical practitioners would,

280
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,124
would recognize that difference.
And Mark's is trying to do a kind of 

281
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,693
constantly trying to do a forensic kind 
of inspection of a capitalist system to 

282
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:57,900
find out what these symptoms which you 
see on the surface,

283
00:13:57,901 --> 00:14:00,060
like increasing inequality,
where,

284
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,170
where those symptoms are coming from in 
terms of was producing them.

285
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:04,971
Yeah.
I see.

286
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:06,270
I see.
Um,

287
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,910
may I ask when a law recently we spoke 
to Al Gore,

288
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,950
we spoke to Al Gore about climate 
change,

289
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,310
Al Gore,
uh,

290
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,160
talking to us about like how,
you know,

291
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:15,994
in a sense,
I suppose he's a raise on debt sre and 

292
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,893
explicit mission,
which seems to have some nobility about 

293
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:26,800
it is to galvanize and enthuse people 
about being sort of responsible.

294
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,480
But when I was talking to Al Gore are 
kept thinking and in fact saying,

295
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,471
yeah,
but hold on a minute.

296
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,070
If you need that to stop,
can't you do the best and they've got to

297
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:39,700
be sort of some stern,
I'm definitive regulation of that.

298
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,563
Otherwise it will just carry on like an 
then this guy's regular like defy in an 

299
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:49,030
absolute regulation of energy companies,
certain kinds of traits,

300
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:52,280
certain kinds of labor.
So in in the capitol,

301
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,980
is it dealing with my same,
well it's no point just asking.

302
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,560
People have you know,
turn the tap off,

303
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:00,260
are they clean their teeth?
It's much more important than say,

304
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,480
well you can't have that amount of 
profit.

305
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:04,610
You can't operate in that way.
He's that way.

306
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:05,990
He's that Crista does that critique?

307
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,213
Yeah,
that does.

308
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,103
That's a very good point.
I mean what my view of a Al Gore is he 

309
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:13,954
thinks that you can actually solve the 
climate change problem within the 

310
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:18,094
parameters of a capitalist system and 
that he doesn't want to do away with 

311
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:26,350
capitalism and we spray is trying to 
protect capitalism from the consequences

312
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:29,950
of climate change.
Whereas I take the view that a,

313
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,813
the main producer of climate change is 
of course the driving force of capital 

314
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,134
accumulation.
And until you've dealt with the driving 

315
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:37,354
force of capital accumulation,
you're going to get all these promises 

316
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:43,780
about new technologies which are going 
to solve the problem and so on.

317
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,093
Uh,
but you're not going to get a 

318
00:15:45,881 --> 00:15:49,600
fundamental kind of a solution without 
challenging capital itself.

319
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,940
So it's kind of futile,
isn't it?

320
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:51,774
And it's sort of sort of using the means
of a kind of a contemporary consumer 

321
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:56,214
society in that it's about your 
individual choice and usually 

322
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,790
individually recycle and individually do
they make these kind of choices?

323
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,353
Um,
there's a thing I'm very interested in 

324
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:07,140
and I keep asking people about it and 
they don't know.

325
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:08,880
So I'll ask you,
there's this thing I read.

326
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:09,714
Gandy said they went,
this is him that point ass kicking out 

327
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,480
the British and then ash just doing 
their job for him.

328
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,690
Uh,
what India is a country of 70,000

329
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:22,260
villages that's built on craft economies
where everybody works all the time.

330
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:23,094
We have to focus less on mass production
and think instead of production for the 

331
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,060
masses,
and to do this,

332
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:27,894
we're going to have to break out spell.
We've commodification as long as people 

333
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:31,920
are thinking we've got to get more and 
more stuff,

334
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,830
we're going to be in trouble.
Now that is where it starts to interface

335
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,500
with the individual bottle.
Like this thing he said about 70,000

336
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:39,900
village each one or to po it,
autonomous,

337
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,530
independent and trading only in access 
and being where possible.

338
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,750
Self-Sufficient.
What's he saying there?

339
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:47,020
Candy is this,
is that

340
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,733
it's,
it's a utopian vision in some ways and 

341
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:51,674
I'm not against Utopian visions.
You need that water if you were right 

342
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,990
utopia.
Oh you do?

343
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,100
Oh,
I know.

344
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,090
I kind of like a little bit of Utopian.

345
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,491
No,
I love it.

346
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,250
I don't,
I don't entirely lie on,

347
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:04,360
I own

348
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,200
it.
And,

349
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,910
and I think that that,
that,

350
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:07,744
well,
well candy's saying is that there is a 

351
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,380
way of organizing production and 
consumption,

352
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:12,214
which is radically different from that,
which is given by the industrialization 

353
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:18,410
model.
And he was faced with a,

354
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:21,580
you know,
Nairu and develop mentalism which was to

355
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:25,120
bring in factories and solve the problem
that way.

356
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:29,530
And a Gandy saying no,
there was another kind of solution where

357
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:30,364
I think there's a,
there's a problem with that is in a 

358
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:37,120
situation of very strong population 
change and population growth.

359
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,470
Yeah,
the 70,000

360
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:40,780
villages were all but the growing and 
then,

361
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,663
uh,
and there are other issues which arise 

362
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:45,154
like,
uh,

363
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,183
how,
how do you,

364
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,210
how do you deal with local famines under
circumstances,

365
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,470
that kind of man,
if you get crop failures amongst say,

366
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,190
20,000
villages in the said part,

367
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:57,930
and how do you support,
uh,

368
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,890
what happens there?

369
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,723
So the,
the haze assumption is that they'll 

370
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,943
never be a crop failure.
Whereas historically there are crop 

371
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:08,490
failures because of climate issues and 
her malpractices and things like that.

372
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,440
So you need to have,
uh,

373
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:11,274
an organization that can deal with the,
with the possibility of crop failures 

374
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,770
and,
and,

375
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:19,230
and can redistribute wealth between the 
villages when it's,

376
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,620
when it's really necessary.
And the other difficulty is when they're

377
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:23,454
independent and autonomous villages,
some of the villages will start to get 

378
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,100
very afterward and very rich and some of
them will get very poor.

379
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:29,934
What are you going to do about the 
inequalities of income is between 

380
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:32,664
different villages.
Gandy didn't think about those sorts of 

381
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:36,970
things.
And I,

382
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:37,804
and I think you have to think about form
of organization will put all those 

383
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:41,484
village economists together.
So you've believed that in Arcos into 

384
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,933
Elysium,
Eh,

385
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:47,840
Eh,
Eh,

386
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,793
Eh,
I suppose a version of what Gandy was 

387
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:53,990
talking you could go to and our coasts 
and colorism from,

388
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,290
from,
from what he's talking about.

389
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,300
I don't think he would want no bad at 
all,

390
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:58,050
but,
but,

391
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,883
but you could move in that direction.
And of course there's a lot of interest 

392
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:02,304
these days in solidarity economies and 
autonomous development and this place 

393
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:08,070
and uh,
you know,

394
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:08,904
and as a coach,
it's a great faith in autonomy at the 

395
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,084
seminar.
Our autonomy is going to be the 

396
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:14,340
solution.
Am I answer to that is,

397
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:16,740
I think autonomy is a good thing when 
you know what you're doing with it,

398
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,843
but it's not the solution.
Because if you don't have autonomy 

399
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:20,514
relations between autonomous groups,
you're going to get a great deal of any 

400
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:25,020
quality.
You're going to get the famine problem,

401
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:26,970
you're going to get all sorts of issues 
with this kind,

402
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,700
uh,
which have to be sold by,

403
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,563
by integrating a local economies with 
each other in such a way that they can 

404
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:37,680
some mutually support each other in 
times of difficulty.

405
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,200
And so it is a,
it's a,

406
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,240
presumably what you're agreeing for Wa 
capital is arguing for is that the,

407
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,293
the role of the state,
but the state has to have a benevolent 

408
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,050
and redistributive role and all that 
done.

409
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,610
There has to be,
well put it this way,

410
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,050
they have to be mechanisms of a 
redistribution and,

411
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,050
and,
and the like and,

412
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:02,070
and mutual support.
And that has to be organized.

413
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:02,904
Now when he used the term state,
we often think about the capitalist 

414
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:07,440
state and I don't like the capitalist 
state,

415
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,880
but we do need a form of governments and
governmental inter interventions.

416
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:14,280
And I like some of these things where 
they talk about,

417
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,830
you know,
[inaudible] for example,

418
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:19,040
and this idea about municipal socialism 
or,

419
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:19,431
and,
and,

420
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:22,410
and local socialism days,
you'd have autonomous,

421
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,200
uh,
assemblies.

422
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,243
But then there will be a super assembly 
that we would start to deal with the 

423
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:31,560
relations between and,
and then he'd have a super,

424
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:33,570
super assembly in which,
uh,

425
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,160
yeah,
what's happening in,

426
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,150
say North America gets connected was,
was happening in South Africa and,

427
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,270
and issues like climate change are 
addressed because you need an a,

428
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,690
a global organization to deal with.

429
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,523
The climate change problem is going to 
be dealt with simply by everybody 

430
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,820
changing behavior,
as you mentioned earlier.

431
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,340
So you need,
so you need some form of,

432
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:57,430
of governmental structure of 
coordination.

433
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,501
Uh,
and I,

434
00:20:58,501 --> 00:20:59,820
and I think,
uh,

435
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,270
uh,
the autonomy argument is,

436
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:05,110
is powerful up to a point,
but it needs to go much further.

437
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,330
When I say that,
then people say,

438
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:08,164
oh,
you're in favor of the capitalist state 

439
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:09,994
and you just want to,
you can get a state power and we know 

440
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:14,770
the state is a disaster and yes,
where the current state is a disaster,

441
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:16,720
it's an instrument of capitalist 
domination.

442
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,450
I'm also,
I think now that it was even in the 19th

443
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:24,451
century and we see it being a militarize
so it can suppress social opposition and

444
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:26,740
social movements and,
and so,

445
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:27,221
you know,
I,

446
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:28,054
I'm,
I'm really against the kind of 

447
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:31,250
capitalist state,
but,

448
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,570
but that doesn't mean I'm against some 
sort of form of government,

449
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,493
uh,
look and deal with these much broader 

450
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,120
global kind of problems.
How will do you,

451
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,510
how would we ever arrive at that?
How would they,

452
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,583
how would we have a form of state that 
was benevolent and acting in the 

453
00:21:49,281 --> 00:21:50,114
interests of its population?
And can you now answer a question and 

454
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:57,030
you must be continually called upon to 
answer that,

455
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,920
where like I'm glad that you did this 
distinctions between socialism,

456
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:05,450
Marxism and communism and it,
how do you address the great failures of

457
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:07,220
communism in the last century?

458
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,770
Well,
first off,

459
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,570
I don't think necessarily the communism 
was a great failure.

460
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,900
Uh,
I mean,

461
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:15,781
I called her,
you know,

462
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:17,220
style and is good.
Lacks.

463
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,530
Yeah.
Well,

464
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,400
yeah,
there were some very,

465
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:22,320
very bad parts of that history.
Uh,

466
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,183
on the other hand,
I think what was interesting was after 

467
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:29,601
the collapse of the Soviet Union,
life expectancy in the Soviet Union went

468
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:33,990
down in Russia know enormously.
A lot of people,

469
00:22:33,991 --> 00:22:36,360
they're suddenly found all their rights 
or disappeared.

470
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:37,021
I mean,
so,

471
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:41,820
so I think we are wrong to kind of say 
everything that the communist dead was,

472
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:42,600
was,
was,

473
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,433
was terrible.

474
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,930
Mostly I've been propagandized to live 
there.

475
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,100
My perception of what happened in the 
car communist union,

476
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,123
that century has been totally realized 
and I don't really understand it cause 

477
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:55,950
it does.
I mean cause I don't know.

478
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,700
Yeah,
look at,

479
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,533
look I'm not,
I don't want to get in a situation of 

480
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:02,530
saying everything was great and 
wonderful and a no criticism.

481
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,393
But if you look at a place like Cuba and
you look at the health care delivery in 

482
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,630
Cuba,
it's fantastic as well.

483
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,260
Education,
you know,

484
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,150
and,
and so there's some very good things.

485
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,060
Awesome,
good things.

486
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:14,894
And,
but like I think we have to address 

487
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,003
that.
Some of the things that seem like I was 

488
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:21,494
always good fan on the telly once with a
woman that was doing a documentary said 

489
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:28,930
it seems that communism in Soviet 
communism unconsciously or inadvertently

490
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,493
mimicked this,
the social structure that immediately 

491
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:36,470
proceeded it czar Islam in the,
in spite of its declared objectives,

492
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:37,304
it has a hierarchal structures and did 
lead to oppression and persecution of a 

493
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:41,804
cliff.

494
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,590
Yeah.
No,

495
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,410
I mean I mean I don't,
I don't deny that a lot that,

496
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:46,244
but I do think that,
oh we have to give credibility to some 

497
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:55,240
of the things that happened on the 
commute or something.

498
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:56,074
The other thing I have to say is this a,
the reason that most of us have the 

499
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:03,710
standard of living we have today is 
because of the communist threat.

500
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,220
If the communist threat and not being 
there after 1945 you know,

501
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,103
we wouldn't have had the delivery of the
welfare state such as it was and all 

502
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,820
those kinds of things which allow us 
increasing life expectancy.

503
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,970
And it's interesting.
They are,

504
00:24:17,971 --> 00:24:18,804
over the last few years,
life expectancy has been going down in 

505
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:23,120
some of the major capitalist countries.
Britain,

506
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:24,570
for example,
Cameron,

507
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,460
I think as the first prime minister to 
leave with a lower life expectancy,

508
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,303
the money came in.

509
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,980
Well I think he's,
he's gone up,

510
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:32,900
you should say the armed guards outside 
his house.

511
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,670
Nothing's happening or that gazer let me
tell you,

512
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,513
it is how bill crawling around 
everywhere and there's an ambulance on 

513
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:38,780
got.
I can't,

514
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:40,370
that was having to anyone else elaborate
grove.

515
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:43,460
I must be terrified.
All hell bill or outside one else.

516
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,160
Right.
But Look,

517
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,310
David,
this is a thing and it goes on basically

518
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,980
my position and more first though,
it may be,

519
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,710
I need substantiated as it will continue
to be,

520
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,440
is this,
that we need radical change.

521
00:24:57,441 --> 00:24:58,274
Yes.
And part of that does seem to be the 

522
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:03,440
dismantling of a capitalist state and a 
new system based on sharing.

523
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,830
But when we even appear to have an 
allegiance to like,

524
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:07,890
hey,
like anything,

525
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,540
an umbrella under which she had stolen 
is a more,

526
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,211
and like,
you know,

527
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:12,740
me,
I'd love a bit of Shea Guevara,

528
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,723
but you can't,
you've tried saying that in Miami 

529
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,733
people,
the kickbacks pretty fierce in her life 

530
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:20,450
because like,
because of the floors and because of,

531
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,100
you know,
like we've been,

532
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:24,530
I grew up in the 80s and Cold War,
which is,

533
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:25,170
you know,
see a,

534
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,820
a town of two,
two sides.

535
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,930
I've,
I find it very hard to unpick that.

536
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,770
And anything that seems revivalist are 
nostalgic about communism,

537
00:25:33,771 --> 00:25:35,510
that's already happened.
I think people were like,

538
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:36,344
no thanks mate.

539
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,710
You don't want to do that.
I mean,

540
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:39,340
I,
I'm,

541
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,470
I'm,
I've been interested in some of these,

542
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,800
uh,
programs,

543
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,270
for example,
uh,

544
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:47,650
in,
in northern Syria,

545
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:52,710
the Kurds have reorganized things along 
a kind of a assembly structures,

546
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,930
uh,
partly inspired by the,

547
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:56,764
an alternative notion of democracy.
I think that right now some of the 

548
00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:01,354
progressive mass in Spain or trying to 
come up with a way of creating more 

549
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:06,124
democratic assembly structures.
So I think there's a lot of 

550
00:26:08,921 --> 00:26:11,500
experimentation that needs to be done on
things like that.

551
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,700
I think the big problem with communism 
was they had us and what I call a single

552
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:16,534
bullet theory of social change,
which was put in classic Marxist terms 

553
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:25,450
that the productive forces that is,
if you could command production,

554
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,703
then you'd really,
the rest of society would take care of 

555
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:30,490
everything in a proper kind of way.

556
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,740
I think we have to work on,
on,

557
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:33,574
on a whole range of different issues 
including sort of culture relation to 

558
00:26:38,201 --> 00:26:40,720
nature.
And we have to deal with a problem right

559
00:26:40,721 --> 00:26:42,430
now,
which is fundamental to me,

560
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:43,264
which is what I call global alienation.
The alienation of populations 

561
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,970
politically from their jobs,
from their daily life possibilities.

562
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,760
And,
and you've got alienated populations all

563
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:56,190
over the world who then do crazy things 
sometimes,

564
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:58,410
you know,
that can be passive for a while and then

565
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:02,670
something happens and you get these sort
of seemingly irrational outbreaks of,

566
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,450
uh,
of craziness and they erect elect Donald

567
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,170
Trump and do things like that.
So I think alienation is one of the big,

568
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,004
big issues.
And when you have populations that are 

569
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:13,944
alienated then then you can't address it
by sort of sign obote communist at that 

570
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:22,950
cause there was there as Eileen a pillar
is I as alienated from political parties

571
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,560
like the Communist parties and so on as 
they are from anything else.

572
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,393
So it's hard then to rebuild some sort 
of a trust with Eileen knighted 

573
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:36,180
populations and that's a lot of 
political work to do.

574
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,980
And I think there's an interesting 
distinction for me between uh,

575
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,903
what might be called a social media is a
form of communication and social media 

576
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:50,160
leading to forms of organization.
The communicative forms are very good,

577
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,023
the organizational forms are very bad 
right now and we've really got to think 

578
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:56,700
about how to,
how to construct organizational forms.

579
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:59,460
And I agree with you entirely.
I'm not nostalgic about,

580
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,220
you know,
what the Communists did except that,

581
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,323
you know,
when it comes to healthcare and that 

582
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:05,281
kind of thing,
I'd say,

583
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:08,430
well we should look at how the Cubans 
did it and no one an education.

584
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,563
We should look at the,

585
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,653
yes,
I understand you're in now matched by 

586
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:12,574
the beauty of the original idea,
the veracity of the critique and the 

587
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,410
possibility of components of it.
Cause you said that great.

588
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,200
It kind of was how many take that down,
how it looks.

589
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,950
That's what I'm interested is it will be
recorded is open or causes.

590
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:25,930
Okay.
Thank you.

591
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:27,700
I've seen endorsement that's going on 
the poster.

592
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,010
You say to that,
great,

593
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,770
I'm going to give that in as a thing.
As my phd,

594
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:33,604
I'm not doing a phd.
I'm doing the math on that begins with 

595
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:35,404
them.
I'm really going to have to start 

596
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:41,581
listening in those lectures and that is 
yes that you like that and uh,

597
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,870
I have a compliment.
I'm so ego led.

598
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,763
If someone's nice to me,
it takes me about an hour to recover 

599
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:47,923
from my graces because I've been given a
compliment that's just take a while to 

600
00:28:51,371 --> 00:28:54,940
reflect on the compliment and the move 
on with the interview.

601
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,033
And my point is,
is that w let's say what's needed is 

602
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,590
something that whilst it may be derived 
from or capital or capital or booklet,

603
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,140
I've only just learned to say correctly 
and now you've made can be,

604
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:07,010
I'll do it like that.

605
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,740
I suppose David,
the thing that sort of interests me,

606
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,800
the reason I'm doing this podcast is I 
sense that change is possible.

607
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,680
I sense that we are being lied to.
I S I can feel I the,

608
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,603
the,
the argument that you made about 

609
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:28,300
alienation,
it's so,

610
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:30,550
it's so in evidence.
Um,

611
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,443
and I,
I went to that Cuba when I was quite 

612
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,890
young,
22 and it was magnificent.

613
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,190
I was there of all things to record a 
chewing gum commercial.

614
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,860
It should the most vacuous product 
imaginable,

615
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,723
not even nutrition,
just the act of mastication as a ritual 

616
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,830
and an idea while people,
staff.

617
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,073
And while there,
luckily I'm a drug addict because of 

618
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,341
that.
It was then,

619
00:29:51,341 --> 00:29:53,590
I'm clean now.
So that means that wherever I go,

620
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,230
I have to go and find for people that 
know where the drugs are.

621
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,090
So that means you'd have to get off the 
rails.

622
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,970
You have to go down the rabbit hole.
So I found myself in these things called

623
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:03,730
Barrios in Havana.
I liked it,

624
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,900
I liked the people and I liked the 
murals.

625
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,960
And there was a sense of Julie and glory
and potentiality and caused from the 50s

626
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:14,884
wine,
not just streets painted by people in 

627
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:19,480
this presence of people and people's 
creativity.

628
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,613
And as you say,
the absence of that set alienation that 

629
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:26,530
comes when you don't participate in your
city,

630
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:28,240
when you don't participate in your 
culture,

631
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:31,090
when you know you have no power,
when you know you have no meaning,

632
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:34,510
how lost you feel.
I felt something different then,

633
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:35,620
but I was on drugs.
So you know,

634
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:38,830
all of my experiences were being 
filtered through trucks,

635
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,540
but I,
you know,

636
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,190
and that was before I knew that they had
bloody good then.

637
00:30:42,191 --> 00:30:42,900
Okay,
you know,

638
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,290
live here and you know,
all of that.

639
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,500
But what I feel like when we are posing 
an idea to people now,

640
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,380
I think what like w in there,
what,

641
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:57,010
what did Lenin,
Trotsky,

642
00:30:57,011 --> 00:30:57,844
the Bolsheviks et Cetera,
take from that book capital and use in 

643
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,900
the revolution in coal museum.
And how did it become that,

644
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:05,531
you know,
like,

645
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,191
uh,
the,

646
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:08,860
the failure that it became,
even if you take as failure,

647
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,920
either the fall of the Berlin Wall,
the end of the Soviet Union,

648
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:13,900
and what has happened in,
in Russia now.

649
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:14,910
Yeah.

650
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:15,743
See that,
that's a question I often get asked to 

651
00:31:17,631 --> 00:31:19,530
my back away from.
I kind of say,

652
00:31:19,531 --> 00:31:21,000
I kind of say,
look,

653
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,750
uh,
yeah,

654
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,300
Lennon and trust gay and Bacara and all 
these people.

655
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:25,134
I read Capitol and I took certain things
from him and I did certain things from 

656
00:31:28,101 --> 00:31:30,750
him.
Our job right now is to read capital and

657
00:31:30,751 --> 00:31:33,480
find out what we want to do with it.
What shall we did?

658
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,343
Yeah.
Well,

659
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,580
well,
first off,

660
00:31:35,581 --> 00:31:37,680
you gotta learn how to read it,
you know,

661
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,120
and,
and,

662
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:42,500
and that is not initially an easy thing.
And that's horrible.

663
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,330
I hope some of those things I ride help 
people get into it.

664
00:31:45,331 --> 00:31:46,920
That's going to be vital.
It,

665
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,350
you're going to have to do that as 
really important.

666
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:50,830
And,
uh,

667
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,590
you know,
and I have these things on the web where

668
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:54,360
you can do the,
you can,

669
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,440
there's a course on Marx's kapital 
volume one and volume two on the web,

670
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:00,540
but you know,
and you can take it on the web.

671
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,190
Um,
so,

672
00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:03,570
so yeah,
open it up.

673
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:04,404
But in the process,
making sure that we understand what it 

674
00:32:07,471 --> 00:32:08,360
is that,
that,

675
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,313
that miles is really teaching us about 
the nature of this system and know that 

676
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:14,454
it comes back to this is not what it 
appears to be on the surface to can we 

677
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:19,890
develop a way of critique?
So I want,

678
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,083
I want to educate people if I can,
not necessarily to regurgitate knocks 

679
00:32:25,141 --> 00:32:25,974
cause that's not the point,
but to use his mode of an analysis so 

680
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,870
you can start to see,
okay these populations that alienated,

681
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,810
why are they alienated?
Where's the alienation come from?

682
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,240
Once it got to do with the nature of the
Labor process,

683
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,510
why is it labor process the way it is 
these days?

684
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,523
Why did capitalist technology decide 
that they wanted a labor process which 

685
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:47,700
disempowered the Labor?
Yeah.

686
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,060
Why is,
why is that there?

687
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,560
Why is it,
as [inaudible] says,

688
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:52,394
it's wonderful thing where he starts off
one of these chapters and he kind of 

689
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:54,921
said,
John,

690
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:57,260
Stuart Mill has this problem.
He says,

691
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:58,094
look,
we have all this labor saving machinery 

692
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:00,224
right now and you've ever thought this 
labor saving machinery but lighten the 

693
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,314
load of labor and John Single.
But the funny thing is is it seems that 

694
00:33:06,511 --> 00:33:08,090
it doesn't,
the actually,

695
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,250
it makes it a lot of the labor of worse 
and Marxists,

696
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,250
but of course it does because the 
purpose of the machinery's not delight,

697
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:18,590
lighten the load of labor is to extract 
more value and more surplus value,

698
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,720
a more profit from the labor.
Of course,

699
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,510
if the machine can help you do that,
and then that's what it does.

700
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:24,643
So this is where there's,
so this gives you an understanding of 

701
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:29,240
capitalist technology,
which evaded Don's do at mill,

702
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:32,870
but we smog sees very clearly and we see
very clearly and say,

703
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,240
actually the purpose of technology could
change.

704
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:36,883
There are all kinds of person,
but it was military and all the rest of 

705
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:39,314
it in there.
But one of the big purposes of it is to 

706
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:43,040
disempower the labor.
Yes.

707
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,070
And and when the Labor is disempowered,
guess what?

708
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,990
They become alienated.
Yes.

709
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:48,883
Guess what?
They start behaving in an out of the 

710
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,163
united way.
You know when you go at least things 

711
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:54,410
sort of going on,
you're kind of saying,

712
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,573
well these are the kinds of insights 
that come out of reading Marx's capital 

713
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,000
and you kind of go,
wow,

714
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,800
no.
Once I've got that insight,

715
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,993
I can't look at any discussion of 
technological change and imagine it's 

716
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:07,220
got some,
some socialist utopia attached to it.

717
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,940
As you know how some of the people who 
are writing these days do the artificial

718
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:14,670
intelligence is the new socialist utopia
now.

719
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,610
Well you see what happens.
Uber,

720
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,340
Uber,
Uber starts as a kind of sharing economy

721
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:20,174
and the next thing you know it's become 
capitalized and somebody become a 

722
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:23,390
billionaire out of it.

723
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,160
You got high,
you got the ability of the system.

724
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,880
Is capitalism good morally,
ethically it's,

725
00:34:30,881 --> 00:34:32,250
look,
it's very big obstacle.

726
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,390
Anything.
You can take anything like I,

727
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:35,224
I,
my understanding of it is it primarily 

728
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:37,334
over the way that it interacts with 
culture and creativity and how you can 

729
00:34:40,021 --> 00:34:42,780
see mimicked in its narrative.
The,

730
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,660
uh,
central floor iee for example,

731
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,673
take hip hop,
which begins as sort of very defiant 

732
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,020
then goes through a stage of being 
Utopian and beautiful and then oh,

733
00:34:52,021 --> 00:34:52,854
becomes commodified,
becomes clearly a product and to some 

734
00:34:54,931 --> 00:34:55,764
degree about products and about commerce
and about acquisition and about like 

735
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:04,270
he's,
if the ideology is so endemic,

736
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,200
it's so all encompassing that it becomes
invisible.

737
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,830
So you say that part of capitalism's DNA
is it its own concealment,

738
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,860
it's own consuming is a primary 
function.

739
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,900
Once it's concealed,
his self care can continue.

740
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,220
Now what I think is,
you know,

741
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,370
when people talk about lean,
you know,

742
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:19,204
the system and the floors were the 
system who obviously when you say you 

743
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,930
know about technology's role is to 
technology,

744
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,570
you know,
John's mills all baffled by it for marks

745
00:35:27,571 --> 00:35:27,841
goes,
no,

746
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:28,111
no,
no,

747
00:35:28,111 --> 00:35:29,400
it's doing its job perfectly.

748
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:33,390
Or is that not true of bureaucracy and 
systems of control for someone?

749
00:35:33,391 --> 00:35:36,120
This system for some people,
for some groups I'm institution,

750
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,810
this system is brilliant,
is working 100% effectively.

751
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,730
We have all about climate change.
No problem.

752
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,760
Whereby alienation,
inequality,

753
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,701
riots,
death,

754
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:46,080
murder,
that's the best summation.

755
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,153
No problem.
So who is this strata for whom this 

756
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:52,830
system is beneficial?
Who are they?

757
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,110
How do we influence,
control,

758
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,360
diminish,
limit oppose them.

759
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,370
Phd.
That's what you got to do.

760
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,320
So she could have sold out.
No,

761
00:36:05,321 --> 00:36:08,710
I mean I could give some preliminary 
salary answers to those questions.

762
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,480
Write this down.
Yeah.

763
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:11,650
Well I'm in,
it's an it's,

764
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,240
I mean you're in a great position to 
take that sort of stuff on big time.

765
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,403
Yeah.
Because I mean it's very important when 

766
00:36:21,191 --> 00:36:24,940
you're doing a phd to be in love with 
the no matter you're doing,

767
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:28,690
you know,
cause otherwise also brand myself by me,

768
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,903
which is,
which is fine because here's why you 

769
00:36:31,631 --> 00:36:34,710
should be about in some ways.
So I think it's a,

770
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,300
but yeah.
Who,

771
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,163
who benefits while you can see who who,
who extracts wealth from it and how 

772
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,640
wealth goods I guess.
Yeah.

773
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,070
How Jeff Bezos gets his money and now he
is the guy rounds,

774
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:51,610
Amazon,
right and good though on my Amazon.

775
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:52,570
But they're part of the problem.

776
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:55,390
I didn't pay the bloody tax a t bloody 
Begley controlling everything.

777
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,630
So that would have to go and how Google,
and I know elise,

778
00:36:58,631 --> 00:36:59,464
I love monopolies are kind of been set 
up so they'd been set up in such a way 

779
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:03,551
and,
and,

780
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:04,600
and,
and actually,

781
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:06,730
you know,
I use use a minnow,

782
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:12,750
definitely awesome at the same time,
value is being extracted from us,

783
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,970
kind of rent is being taken away from 
us.

784
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,790
Uh,
and,

785
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,210
and,
and so we've got these,

786
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,190
these,
these systems now which,

787
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,090
which,
which,

788
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:22,841
you know,
and,

789
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:25,370
and I think particularly in the cultural
field and so on,

790
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,253
the,
the forms of exploitation and 

791
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:30,210
appropriation are,
are,

792
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:31,570
are becoming and are pretty,
uh,

793
00:37:31,571 --> 00:37:32,650
pretty,
pretty chronic.

794
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:33,484
I mean,
there've been that way for quite a 

795
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:37,120
while,
but it seems to me right now,

796
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:40,000
particularly given the problems that I 
mentioned earlier,

797
00:37:40,001 --> 00:37:43,110
the capitalist running out of places to 
go for new things to do,

798
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,980
just geographical a geographically,
uh,

799
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,933
and,
and actually it's increasingly relying 

800
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,301
upon,
you know,

801
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:50,134
culture,
the production and commodification of 

802
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:55,360
culture.
What does that mean?

803
00:37:55,361 --> 00:37:57,440
What do you mean by that?
Is the commodification of culture.

804
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,200
For example,
if,

805
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:02,020
if,
if we want to have a short turnover time

806
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,970
or something,
then,

807
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,090
then the spectacle is instantaneously 
consumed.

808
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,733
It's gone.
It's not like my grandmother's knives 

809
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:12,180
and forks.
It doesn't ask 150 years,

810
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,800
this is the Olympic Games or something 
like that.

811
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:15,643
But it becomes,
becomes a big mode of capital 

812
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:18,934
accumulation.
Vast amounts of money goes into 

813
00:38:20,771 --> 00:38:21,604
rebuilding the infrastructure and doing 
all the things that the construction 

814
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:26,320
interest wants to do.
And the Olympic Games or 10 days,

815
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:27,154
it's all gone.

816
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,280
And there was an x games that running 
track round out pink and,

817
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,371
and,
and,

818
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:34,141
and,
and,

819
00:38:34,141 --> 00:38:34,890
uh,
how many,

820
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:35,590
how many,
uh,

821
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,190
Biennale

822
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,430
is,
are there now and every city has a bnr.

823
00:38:38,431 --> 00:38:39,970
Yeah,
he's a patient with a cultural,

824
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,833
you know like Venice exhibition or the 
Shanghai exhibition and the and and so 

825
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,653
and so you suddenly find though the 
whole kind of cultural realm is being 

826
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,450
used as a,
as a sort of commodification real estate

827
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:55,900
development kind of a scam.
Yes.

828
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,790
So okay,
I see.

829
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,270
It's like that there's a,
a matrix of commodification.

830
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:04,240
It's applied to everything and you can 
see it's prints,

831
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,074
fingerprints,
if it would have anything that's 

832
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:08,560
organic,
his fingers on everything.

833
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,160
Like football being a great example.
How like,

834
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:13,510
you know,
if you listen to talk sport,

835
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:16,000
which is obviously I think now owned by 
sort of sky and stuff,

836
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,033
this is the sort of delicious,
cruel irony of like what everyone is 

837
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:24,190
talking about all the time is I was just
all goes about bloody money.

838
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,083
So goes about money and like the way 
that sort of like the way that football 

839
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:29,870
looks now and of course in our players,
amber,

840
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:33,190
I mean that's one of the few ways that 
working class person as a chance to vent

841
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,500
in any money is to become a world class 
football.

842
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,970
So that's what I,
that's not my point,

843
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:41,260
but my point is that somehow the essence
of the game is surviving.

844
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,123
This process of commodification,
how the experience is being turned into 

845
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:45,514
a product,
how even age roots in community is 

846
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:51,490
tribal roots,
its roots as a congregational activity,

847
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:52,324
a spice for union.
And togetherness is basically layer 

848
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:57,880
after layer of commerce wrapped around 
it.

849
00:39:57,881 --> 00:40:01,330
The players appearing in the adverse 
adverse on the shirts.

850
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:03,460
You know,
how long before the pitch has adverts on

851
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:04,030
there,
how long,

852
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,863
you know,
it's obvious say it's creeping through 

853
00:40:07,091 --> 00:40:07,930
our consciousness.

854
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,920
It's everywhere.
And one of the things I think as well is

855
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,310
I feel like you're growing up.
When I did,

856
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:14,510
I commodify people,
I think I,

857
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,663
I have to uncork I have to consciously 
unstitch my tendency to look at people 

858
00:40:19,631 --> 00:40:20,021
and think,
well,

859
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:22,660
what are you going to do for me?
What are you going to give me something?

860
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,850
Can I have sex with you?
I'm not thinking of this now,

861
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,340
David.
I'm trying to,

862
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,193
I'm married now.
Like I try not to look at people as 

863
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,970
commodities.
That's one of the things,

864
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:31,990
one of the floors,
you know,

865
00:40:31,991 --> 00:40:32,824
you talk about on one hand,
the alienation that people understand 

866
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:35,060
it.
Oh No,

867
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,140
I'm absolutely expendable.
My role is meaningless.

868
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,000
I am only a piece of this machinery and 
organic piece of matter in a machine.

869
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,230
But the other side of that is that we 
start to look each other as commodities.

870
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,810
That we could lose the diff,
the lens of humanity.

871
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,210
She said to me,
you know,

872
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,100
was a central kind of pull up politics.
Uh,

873
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:54,934
I'd like to see,
tell you what I want to politics of 

874
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,473
decommodification.
That is what's happened over the last 

875
00:40:59,981 --> 00:41:00,791
30,
40 years.

876
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,950
Education has become more and more of a 
commodity,

877
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,580
but should stop being a commodity.
It should be a free good to everybody.

878
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,600
Health care is a commodity.
It should be a free good to everybody.

879
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,434
In other words,
we should start a de commodified whole 

880
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:15,880
sectors of the economy.
Now that's this socialism.

881
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:17,530
That's not communism,
that socialism,

882
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,813
that's a,
that's a socialist or a project and 

883
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:22,520
you're right.
We should also stop the,

884
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,120
you know,
start the commodifying others so that we

885
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:28,270
start to look at others as people 
instead of instruments of our own,

886
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,260
you know,
uh,

887
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,143
our own activities and trying to exploit
fair economic ideology requires that it 

888
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,744
does things is sort of biological and 
psychological is stimulate limitless 

889
00:41:40,391 --> 00:41:42,550
need and desire in order to perpetuate 
itself.

890
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,433
Then here's also colonized the 
consciousness and the lives of the 

891
00:41:46,081 --> 00:41:46,914
individuals beyond their economic role.
Cause it requires their spiritual role 

892
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,040
be beholden

893
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,230
to be the ideology.
No,

894
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,103
no.
I think the decolonization of the 

895
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,453
decommodification,
those are the kinds of general food 

896
00:41:59,381 --> 00:42:03,470
fields of endeavor which we can start to
do things on right now.

897
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,210
I don't do it well,
you know,

898
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:08,330
we couldn't even get the Labor party to 
start to go really strongly.

899
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:11,660
I mean abolished student debt for 
example.

900
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,040
There was talk of this.
There's talk of it.

901
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,260
Yeah.
Well stop having talk about it.

902
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,460
Don't do that,
you know,

903
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,800
do the same with uh,
you know,

904
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,050
making sure that there's enough money 
goes into healthcare.

905
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,140
So it's really a non commodified set and
we,

906
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:29,240
you get rid of the secondary kind of 
privatized thing,

907
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,480
which the get,
get us out of the conservatives,

908
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:33,743
you know,
want to use that as a way of sort of 

909
00:42:35,061 --> 00:42:38,150
chewing away at the National Health 
Service so that you're done.

910
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,330
Uh,
you know,

911
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,880
so there's a,
there,

912
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:41,381
there,
there,

913
00:42:41,381 --> 00:42:42,950
there,
there are real politics,

914
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:43,950
uh,
that can have short,

915
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:44,803
even in the short term,
or you can imagine sort of a radical 

916
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,090
beginning.

917
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:48,923
And if people start to think in terms of
decommodification just over something 

918
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:56,000
like education or health care,
and then you can extend it a bit more to

919
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:58,140
housing and then actually the basic,
uh,

920
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,690
food,
uh,

921
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,381
which,
which,

922
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:02,600
you know,
the Cubans you did by the way.

923
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,573
Oh yes.
With a ration book on a ration book 

924
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:06,980
every year.
Certain basic amount of rice and sign,

925
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:08,990
and it's not working too well right now,
but,

926
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,320
but it was a basic food kind of 
allocation that everybody had.

927
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,620
So do things like this and,
and,

928
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:20,450
and uh,
we could do it,

929
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:21,250
you

930
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,083
know,
when people come out of a cult like 

931
00:43:24,131 --> 00:43:24,964
scientology or you know,
they have to sit him down with someone 

932
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:31,840
who goes to all that stuff you've been 
wired up with is not true when they come

933
00:43:31,841 --> 00:43:33,350
back to your mom and dad or whatever he 
is.

934
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,140
And how are we gonna unstitch the 
conditioning generation generation deep.

935
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,250
When I like sometimes just to make 
myself feel better,

936
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,500
I really go and talk to the young people
and like,

937
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,480
you know,
give him Ben there he is about my views.

938
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:50,620
One of the things that's very difficult 
for me,

939
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,420
uh,
as someone now,

940
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,254
you know,
I'm in my forties now and I tried to 

941
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,233
feel like I'm a person that has access 
to the young and I feel like I can 

942
00:43:56,921 --> 00:44:01,760
affect people is to recognize how light 
they are indoctrinated by they want,

943
00:44:01,761 --> 00:44:02,594
right.
The phone don't tell them that they 

944
00:44:03,071 --> 00:44:04,820
don't want the phone because they want 
it.

945
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,390
You know,
how much she learned.

946
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:09,580
They said they think about money.
Why would they not?

947
00:44:09,581 --> 00:44:10,414
How could they not,
how do we begin to see this thing you 

948
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:14,190
said?
The thing you like most of our marks,

949
00:44:14,191 --> 00:44:17,890
his analysis is these ferocity and its 
ability to deconstruct,

950
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,110
critique and reveal essence,
epiphany,

951
00:44:20,111 --> 00:44:22,450
that revelation of essence,
the revelation of real truth,

952
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,284
right.
How are we going to wade through the 

953
00:44:25,901 --> 00:44:29,770
layers of inculcation lacquers their 
mind?

954
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,010
I you started at

955
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,310
various in various ways.
I mean I think marks has asked answer to

956
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:36,144
this is first off he says it should 
start to try to identify certain kinds 

957
00:44:38,731 --> 00:44:43,731
of practices which are very simple 
practices over things like you know,

958
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,753
using people who in instrumental ways 
instead of relating to them as human 

959
00:44:48,211 --> 00:44:50,400
beings and that that these,
these,

960
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,550
these changes can,
you know,

961
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:53,683
so the realm of practices is very 
important and that can be all over the 

962
00:44:55,981 --> 00:44:59,010
place.
The second thing is to start to actually

963
00:44:59,011 --> 00:45:02,610
have a political movement which kind of 
says,

964
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,743
you know,
we don't have to actually create human 

965
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:06,534
beings of the sort that we're creating 
right now with a kind of neo liberal 

966
00:45:09,451 --> 00:45:11,050
aesthetic and all of that.
And,

967
00:45:11,051 --> 00:45:14,430
and we can do things rather differently 
and get people to read.

968
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,640
I mean you mentioned Gandy,
people sometimes read Gandy and get very

969
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:18,474
transformed by it in terms of starting 
to think about the world in a different 

970
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:21,984
kind of way.
And so there's an educational process 

971
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,920
which then gets embedded in a political 
movement.

972
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,800
And I think that is then starts to be 
important.

973
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:29,634
And uh,
that political movement can start to 

974
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:36,051
have effects by orchestrating new forms 
of governance and democracy and the,

975
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:37,350
like,
for instance,

976
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:39,030
if you look at what's going on in 
Barcelona,

977
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:39,864
you've got a radical mare and she's 
trying to set up a kind of a new forms 

978
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:46,440
of democratic consultation within the 
city.

979
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,070
Yes.
She's only just started a,

980
00:45:51,071 --> 00:45:51,904
they only just started working on this,
but this is one of the projects they 

981
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:55,080
have.
So,

982
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,690
but that,
but that project comes out of a bunch of

983
00:45:57,691 --> 00:46:01,560
people who started to develop a small 
practices on the ground who got together

984
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:02,394
and kind of said,
look,

985
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,620
we need to do something.
We are radically different.

986
00:46:04,621 --> 00:46:05,454
I mean,
the mayor comes out of the 

987
00:46:05,821 --> 00:46:07,450
anti-foreclosure movement.
She's,

988
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,090
she very,
very progressive.

989
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:11,370
When she's got a bit of a progressive 
alliance behind her.

990
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:15,420
And so new things can be be set up.
And it's very interesting to me,

991
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:16,254
and I'm interested in urban,
this is not a radical males around the 

992
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:19,224
world.
I mean even places like Seattle and Los 

993
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,240
Angeles have radical councils.
Now we're starting to do things that are

994
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:25,320
very different.
The local level,

995
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:27,480
just to the local level.
And I,

996
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:28,314
this is the way in which this political 
movement can't be taught from the top 

997
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:33,330
down.

998
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,430
It's got,
are all going to get sort of,

999
00:46:35,431 --> 00:46:39,330
it's got to develop organically somehow.
I agree with the People's daily lives.

1000
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:40,164
So you're not thinking that that means 
to a degree then the power has to be 

1001
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:44,890
closer to people and the yes.
And then the essay,

1002
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,580
the idea of state power,
even if apparently they never,

1003
00:46:47,581 --> 00:46:50,310
lynn is always going to seem somehow 
abstract.

1004
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,140
Yes.
And,

1005
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,560
and,
and then you then,

1006
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:53,281
then,
you know,

1007
00:46:53,281 --> 00:46:54,114
to me it's more a dialectical kind of 
relationship between some sort of 

1008
00:46:56,491 --> 00:46:59,760
centralized state power.
So somebody like who's a mayor of a city

1009
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:04,110
has a certain kind of centralized power,
but I rest very much upon,

1010
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:05,790
you know,
local neighborhood movements.

1011
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:06,923
Then what happens is I was movements try
to do certain things and they get 

1012
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:10,374
support.
They need crucial support from an 

1013
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:14,790
American do.
So if you want to develop a new house in

1014
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:15,624
complex,
which is a non commodity housing 

1015
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,473
development of affordable housing and 
you probably need the city to help you 

1016
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:21,774
acquire the land and,
and if the city helps you acquire the 

1017
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:24,984
land and the procedures doing this job.
So said I relationship of certain kind 

1018
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,280
between these different levels

1019
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,113
of shame because you've gotten the most 
recent text messages from John Rogers 

1020
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:36,460
cause he's talking about some people 
they're trying to buy some house.

1021
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,610
My mate John Rogers,
he said First Communist,

1022
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:39,463
I've met when I was young man.
He side fairly my head with thirdly 

1023
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,010
dreams.
Okay.

1024
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,280
Yeah.
He sent me something recently about some

1025
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:48,310
campaign where people are trying to buy 
their own life by their own land and,

1026
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,533
and develop it.
Do you think then that what you're 

1027
00:47:50,831 --> 00:47:52,090
saying,
is it curious,

1028
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:52,983
do you think David,
that they serve sort of forms of more 

1029
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:56,890
localized or at least see wide 
government?

1030
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:57,983
For me,
I would take with my particular code 

1031
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:03,250
that that's an indication that we,
what's required is decentralized,

1032
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:07,240
more decentralized power and perhaps 
this is the end of the nation state.

1033
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:09,740
I mean when you sort of look at what's 
happening in America and him,

1034
00:48:09,741 --> 00:48:10,574
certain strands of British politics,
like can you see pipe perhaps a within 

1035
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,650
the brexit impulse,
a sort of a,

1036
00:48:16,651 --> 00:48:20,050
a certain positivity in that people want
to unpick themselves.

1037
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:20,973
I know there's many reasons for brexit 
waiver on some level to a kind of 

1038
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:26,830
decentralization power being closer to 
people,

1039
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:28,960
people having a degree of authority in 
their own lives.

1040
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:32,260
But I don't believe in a decentralized 
fashion as a,

1041
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:34,570
as an absolute.
I mean because a,

1042
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:37,410
actually it turns out of the,
one of the best ways you can orchestrate

1043
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,760
centralized control is through 
decentralization.

1044
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:40,883
Uh Huh.

1045
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,820
But you think about it at the market is 
a very decentralized system.

1046
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,680
And of course this guy,
it's a,

1047
00:48:45,681 --> 00:48:49,040
it's a,
it's actually compatible with incredible

1048
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:51,290
concentrations of political and economic
power.

1049
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:52,563
So,
so I don't think decentralization in 

1050
00:48:53,991 --> 00:48:54,824
itself is the answer.
I think that some level of decent in a 

1051
00:48:57,981 --> 00:49:00,230
situation where there's not any 
decentralization,

1052
00:49:00,231 --> 00:49:03,290
we'd go for decentralization and then 
lies by its ideology.

1053
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:05,240
There is in the air has such a clear 
mandate.

1054
00:49:05,241 --> 00:49:07,580
It's such a simplistic mandate,
extract profit,

1055
00:49:07,581 --> 00:49:08,510
extract,
profit.

1056
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,110
Like you know,
that that itself is right

1057
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,840
geographical.
It's be like,

1058
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:15,610
it can't be contained.
You can't,

1059
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,100
you and I suppose any attempts to 
regulate,

1060
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,100
yeah,
national level or local level are always

1061
00:49:21,101 --> 00:49:21,934
resisted.
Now another thing is say that for a 

1062
00:49:24,071 --> 00:49:24,904
moment when you said they're like the,
if we had a political pie that wasn't 

1063
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,620
login overtly committed to say,
you know,

1064
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:30,130
sort of,
uh,

1065
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:30,550
like,
you know,

1066
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,180
some of the basics.
Um,

1067
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:33,183
how do you think in governance in 
government such as a nation and it's 

1068
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:40,460
such an ideology would survive one we'd 
like after weapon.

1069
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,110
Grace?
Well,

1070
00:49:43,111 --> 00:49:44,170
you know,
again,

1071
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:45,004
that's one of the big issues.
So you've got these pretty progressive 

1072
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,593
movements when they get political power 
and then they find political power is 

1073
00:49:51,101 --> 00:49:54,520
constrained in certain ways,
and the finances are such that they have

1074
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:56,140
to do things.
So they'd become just like,

1075
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,580
you know,
everybody else.

1076
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:58,870
And we've seen that,
you know,

1077
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:01,110
the history of the Labour Party when 
they came into power,

1078
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:04,090
he started to be very much more pro 
capitalist.

1079
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:05,410
So,
uh,

1080
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:06,290
so I,
uh,

1081
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,180
I think,
uh,

1082
00:50:07,181 --> 00:50:08,014
at that point,
the whole kind of revolutionary impulse 

1083
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:12,870
has to be taken,
uh,

1084
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,773
most,
most seriously and decide a reformist 

1085
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:18,930
party,
uh,

1086
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:24,040
should look to create what I would call 
revolutionary reforms,

1087
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,280
those reforms,
which opened the pathway towards

1088
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,540
further,
if you know,

1089
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:30,893
what does reform,
what would you prioritize the 

1090
00:50:33,511 --> 00:50:37,740
establishment of like benevolent state 
institutions around how often education,

1091
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:38,603
I can see how important that is,
but is it not equally important given 

1092
00:50:41,551 --> 00:50:45,000
what we've discussed that to have 
powerful,

1093
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:48,770
draconian regulation of enterprise?

1094
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:49,521
Yeah.
No,

1095
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:53,620
I'm not in a,
I'm not against a regulating what a,

1096
00:50:53,621 --> 00:50:56,870
the capitalist class is doing a,
I'm very much in favor.

1097
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,700
What does that sound like?
Well it did,

1098
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,080
it sounds like,
uh,

1099
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,700
for example,
uh,

1100
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,553
you put strict rules on pollution and a,
you put strict rules on things like 

1101
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:08,714
occupational safety and health 
conditions in factories and the like so 

1102
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,260
much regulation around their behavior 
and actually those,

1103
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,193
those

1104
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:20,260
around pie as well.

1105
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:21,451
Well,
I,

1106
00:51:21,451 --> 00:51:22,031
I,
I,

1107
00:51:22,031 --> 00:51:22,751
yeah,
I mean,

1108
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,750
I would like to see,
uh,

1109
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:24,781
I mean,
it wouldn't,

1110
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:27,880
what,
what kind of world would it be if Ashley

1111
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:32,800
sign liker them on drag on a principle 
of which was we started out,

1112
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:34,043
well,
it was a big cooperative that became 

1113
00:51:35,141 --> 00:51:37,900
bigger and bigger and bigger originated 
in Spain.

1114
00:51:37,901 --> 00:51:38,734
And the rule was that the salary 
differential should be no more than one 

1115
00:51:41,621 --> 00:51:42,700
to three.
Oh yeah.

1116
00:51:42,701 --> 00:51:43,810
That's cool.
Yeah.

1117
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,040
Now,
recently it's gone to one to nine.

1118
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,030
So you see the kind of pressures on it,
but one to three.

1119
00:51:49,031 --> 00:51:52,090
Imagine if all corporations had to work 
under the,

1120
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,013
under the rule that the writer return to
people in the corporation should a not 

1121
00:51:57,821 --> 00:52:01,690
be more than one to three right now.
Big Corporation heads guess,

1122
00:52:01,691 --> 00:52:06,590
I mean like 300 or 400 times what the 
average height down it.

1123
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:09,970
Yeah,
of course running millions,

1124
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,510
but you legislate it and so kind of say,
okay,

1125
00:52:13,511 --> 00:52:16,330
here's the,
here's the situation and we will be,

1126
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,480
we'll be living in a radically different
world if we,

1127
00:52:18,481 --> 00:52:19,510
if,
if alcor if,

1128
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,360
if,
if hey on right now is a scandalous,

1129
00:52:22,361 --> 00:52:23,194
I mean you have this scandal going on 
here about how much the heads of a 

1130
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:29,610
university is a paid oh,
they're scandal.

1131
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,473
Yeah.
There any [inaudible] earning huge 

1132
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:33,874
amounts.
Yeah.

1133
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:37,870
May.
And at the same time that cutting,

1134
00:52:37,871 --> 00:52:40,150
cutting back on on,
on a number of faculty,

1135
00:52:40,151 --> 00:52:42,190
they hire you now because yeah.

1136
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,660
It's very seductive isn't it?
Yeah.

1137
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,720
Everyone gets loaded in.
Yeah.

1138
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,611
Yeah.
Become a,

1139
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:51,630
become a little dry in.
It's very difficult not to get lured in.

1140
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,130
Yup.
It's like you sort of like,

1141
00:52:53,131 --> 00:52:55,620
you know,
like I knew it was wrong prior to having

1142
00:52:55,621 --> 00:52:57,930
money and I knew so that it wouldn't 
work as well.

1143
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:02,640
And then when you said the comfort,
you see the seduction of comfort.

1144
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,800
I confess I have some of that too.

1145
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,253
And that's why I thank you very much.
That's why that is that there's a 

1146
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:14,160
component to this.
I always harp on about whether,

1147
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,510
and the only way to engender real 
change,

1148
00:53:16,511 --> 00:53:17,344
deep change isn't not through,
I don't think he's through analysis and 

1149
00:53:19,841 --> 00:53:22,240
critique because I think people sort of 
know.

1150
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,820
I think they know,
but like uh,

1151
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,000
for to understand that change is 
possible.

1152
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:29,400
I think you have to make people feel 
differently.

1153
00:53:29,401 --> 00:53:30,660
Yeah.
And like,

1154
00:53:30,661 --> 00:53:31,494
you know,
they sort of the antithesis of the 

1155
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:33,930
alienation that you just described.

1156
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:37,010
Now there's a moment in any kind of 
revolutionary process with where,

1157
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:37,900
yeah,
you're right.

1158
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,000
If people don't feel differently than

1159
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,770
okay it's gone.
Yes.

1160
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:46,250
So I wonder how,
I mean do you mentioned as well there is

1161
00:53:46,251 --> 00:53:49,740
the possibility for mass communication 
and there are some seats.

1162
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:50,823
So I was,
one of the things I was trying to do 

1163
00:53:51,591 --> 00:53:52,424
when I like,
and it was more overly involved in 

1164
00:53:53,571 --> 00:53:56,990
political conversation is I was trying 
to find grand stand flash,

1165
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:57,950
obvious,
blatant,

1166
00:53:57,951 --> 00:53:59,810
bland things that people thought,
oh my God,

1167
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,150
you could do that.
Like,

1168
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:03,830
and the one things you that group 
quarter ad busters.

1169
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:04,883
Okay.
They would sort of say things like 

1170
00:54:05,781 --> 00:54:06,614
Cuellar Corporation and is there 
something about it made me sort of 

1171
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:09,434
tingle with excitement is that they 
would say identify a corporation there 

1172
00:54:12,411 --> 00:54:13,244
is not popular dumb a campaign lips of 
almost like when we campaigning for 

1173
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,000
hospitals or on behalf of unions it 
sort,

1174
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,550
it exists within a million that they 
know how to manage.

1175
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:27,470
Like I feel like a target campaign,
there's like our role is we are going to

1176
00:54:27,471 --> 00:54:28,910
crash,
collapse,

1177
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:33,350
undermine dissemble apple was a 
difficult one because we've all got them

1178
00:54:33,351 --> 00:54:34,760
and they're so bloody popular.

1179
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:37,220
We've all got them.
We were all tacked up in it.

1180
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,720
Right.
But like get it.

1181
00:54:38,721 --> 00:54:39,554
Do you see like that there could be like
the these ideas or is there any 

1182
00:54:42,111 --> 00:54:42,944
potential for that?
I'd like to introduce these kinds of 

1183
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:45,194
ideas are like in it cause it's hard for
me to look at Google and Amazon with 

1184
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:51,950
animosity or you know like even though I
know why don't they pay their taxes?

1185
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:54,260
Why won't you know it?
Because I like those logos,

1186
00:54:54,261 --> 00:54:56,180
those brands and those stories that 
convenience,

1187
00:54:56,181 --> 00:54:57,800
the comfort.
It's so seductive.

1188
00:54:57,801 --> 00:54:59,060
David,
how do you like,

1189
00:54:59,061 --> 00:55:00,200
you know,
like people went,

1190
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:03,080
like when I talked to black cab drivers,
you know,

1191
00:55:03,081 --> 00:55:04,100
and like,
and so I'm like,

1192
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:04,740
yeah buddy.
Yeah.

1193
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,400
One of the few ways that working people 
can have an on his job and then like,

1194
00:55:07,401 --> 00:55:08,234
you know,
Uber,

1195
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:10,540
so creepingly convenient,
right?

1196
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:13,460
What do we do?
How do you ask people,

1197
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:15,350
you know,
like how do you get people to change the

1198
00:55:15,351 --> 00:55:19,790
way they see the world without some sort
of different vehicle into their hearts?

1199
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,653
Well,
you can

1200
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:22,690
boycott is better or something like 
that.

1201
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,600
Uh,
that would be an interesting way.

1202
00:55:25,601 --> 00:55:28,090
In fact,
they did get boycott in New York City.

1203
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,660
It was very interesting.
Yeah.

1204
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:30,973
Uh,
it was a day when a trump declared the 

1205
00:55:33,461 --> 00:55:36,490
no Muslims are allowed from those 
countries and they'll,

1206
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:39,340
everybody's rushing out to the Kennedy 
airport to sort of,

1207
00:55:39,341 --> 00:55:40,174
you know,
lawyers and all this kind of stuff for 

1208
00:55:41,181 --> 00:55:43,270
turning up there.
And,

1209
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:45,370
uh,
the regular cab drivers,

1210
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,350
uh,
went on strike for an hour.

1211
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:51,700
So I actually arrived at Kennedy airport
where,

1212
00:55:51,701 --> 00:55:51,911
I mean,
they,

1213
00:55:51,911 --> 00:55:54,570
all this was happening.
I was impossible to get out because like

1214
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,190
the cab drivers.
But Uber broke the strike and Aruba came

1215
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,670
in the next day,
uh,

1216
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:01,803
social media was of out of says boycott 
uber next day Uber lost half its 

1217
00:56:05,381 --> 00:56:08,260
passengers because,
cause I,

1218
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:11,170
cause I undermined the cab drivers 
striker,

1219
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:13,690
uh,
over the immigrant population.

1220
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,420
And I thought it was very interesting 
but that,

1221
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:17,620
that,
that happened.

1222
00:56:17,621 --> 00:56:20,440
So there is the,
there are ways to go with it.

1223
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:24,160
So the communities with their eyes 
illustrate

1224
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:24,993
these points.
I think sometimes these symbolic things 

1225
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:29,800
are very important and that I am all in 
favor of,

1226
00:56:29,801 --> 00:56:31,360
you know,
any kind of symbolic action.

1227
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:32,194
I mean,
I think the occupy movement was a 

1228
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:33,904
symbolic movement and I think it,
it actually changed the discourse about 

1229
00:56:36,581 --> 00:56:38,560
inequality,
uh,

1230
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:43,650
introduced the concept of the 1% and 
everybody I was down at.

1231
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,553
And so we are,
a lot of people were in the occupy 

1232
00:56:46,061 --> 00:56:47,950
movement and so it was a terrible,
terrible failure.

1233
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:48,551
And he said,
no,

1234
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:49,384
it wasn't a fire.
I mean it did some things which were 

1235
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:54,170
terribly important too soon to tell.
They say,

1236
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:55,023
yeah,
right.

1237
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,230
I May,
I may I run through like a,

1238
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:58,123
the proper questions myself and make 
sure that we've covered everything 

1239
00:57:00,401 --> 00:57:02,560
because you're so fascinating.
Well,

1240
00:57:02,561 --> 00:57:03,550
no,
I'm enjoying it too,

1241
00:57:03,551 --> 00:57:04,384
so,
yeah.

1242
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,293
Yeah.
I love,

1243
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:06,403
we love Pricer Marx's capital.
One of the most important text in the 

1244
00:57:10,181 --> 00:57:12,550
modern era changed the destiny of 
countries' politics.

1245
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,460
People across the world.
What are its key arguments?

1246
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,530
We better pick that up.
I feel that we carry a pair,

1247
00:57:17,531 --> 00:57:19,060
but you think we've covered that?
Yeah,

1248
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,830
I think we all have and that there was 
about this,

1249
00:57:20,831 --> 00:57:23,870
about commodification is about 
accumulation of capital,

1250
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,713
circulation of capital and how it has to
grow and technological change and 

1251
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:30,550
dynamism and all of that understood 
that.

1252
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:31,823
Do his ideas,
the ideas if that's capital of capsule 

1253
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:37,270
continue to resonate today and if so,
what do they still offer?

1254
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,223
Well,
I wish we talked about that too because 

1255
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:40,900
we said,
you know,

1256
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,620
capital is more prevalent around the 
world now and it was back then.

1257
00:57:44,621 --> 00:57:45,454
So in some ways marks is more important 
now because the terrain on which it 

1258
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:51,030
operates is much bigger.
That socialism,

1259
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,990
Marxism,
communism definitely done that.

1260
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,940
Considering the degree to which 
technological,

1261
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:57,880
economic and industrial changes occurred
in the last hundred and 50 years,

1262
00:57:57,881 --> 00:58:01,900
how might marks his analysis and its 
application need to be modified.

1263
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,730
You want to do it a little bit more of 
that?

1264
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:08,350
I think that the answer to it is not 
much.

1265
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,990
Uh,
it's very accurate.

1266
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,380
It's a good,
no,

1267
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:15,490
the thing is that Marx,
yeah,

1268
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:16,324
Marx wrote a lot about what was going on
in the 19th century and that's dated 

1269
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:19,693
what he's writing about,
what he's writing about capital is 

1270
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:23,050
writing about a system which still 
exists,

1271
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,380
which is even more powerful now.
It wasn't his day,

1272
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:29,150
so possibly we can now see how it's laid
out.

1273
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:29,780
We got bloody,
Oh,

1274
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:32,170
he said that was going to happen.
Now there are some aspects,

1275
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:32,880
uh,
the,

1276
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,590
the marks never got around to finishing 
doing on,

1277
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:38,050
for example,
finance and the role of finance where he

1278
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:40,210
read that,
he wrote some very fascinating stuff,

1279
00:58:40,211 --> 00:58:43,570
but he never completed it.
But we need to do that right now because

1280
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:46,990
the financial question is a much bigger 
question now than it was in his day.

1281
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,513
Yes.
Thank you.

1282
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:53,320
Your work is said to be appreciated by 
Anna Case and the outcome and the occupy

1283
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:56,020
movement as much as it is by Linden is 
party organizers.

1284
00:58:56,021 --> 00:58:58,780
Why'd you think miss is?
I have no idea and you should ask them.

1285
00:58:58,810 --> 00:58:59,411
Yeah,
that's right.

1286
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,950
Well done with not being vain.
You should've put that question in their

1287
00:59:01,951 --> 00:59:05,230
cow that makes us look sycophantic or 
cross that out.

1288
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,480
Right.
I believe in the shadow.

1289
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:08,343
It makes us look how authentic.
How has your anthropological and 

1290
00:59:10,871 --> 00:59:13,000
geographical background informed your 
teaching of marks?

1291
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:14,020
That's really good.
Yeah.

1292
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:16,170
I want to know that it's actually,
it's,

1293
00:59:16,171 --> 00:59:17,730
it's a,
I mean I,

1294
00:59:17,731 --> 00:59:20,040
I have a,
I call a different take on mark's taught

1295
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:24,230
our people and the is a m prime,
not primarily interested in mark's.

1296
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:26,780
I'm primarily interested in 
urbanization,

1297
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,760
uneven geographical development at world
scale,

1298
00:59:29,761 --> 00:59:31,670
a local scale and things of that kind.

1299
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,790
And I,
and I,

1300
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:35,810
the only thing I like about marks is it 
helps me understand all of that.

1301
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:36,883
Now when there's somebody in marks,
it doesn't help me understand or that I 

1302
00:59:38,961 --> 00:59:40,540
kind of push it to one side and say kind
of,

1303
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:42,510
I think this is probably a useless bit 
of marks.

1304
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,170
My religion,
I'm very much about,

1305
00:59:45,171 --> 00:59:46,004
I'm very much about mark's a as a,
as a practical guide rather than as a 

1306
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:53,780
grand theory Tisha and who's a pure 
theory got fest.

1307
00:59:53,781 --> 00:59:54,614
And so I uh,
I can't because you come from different 

1308
00:59:56,361 --> 00:59:58,880
disciplines in anthropology and 
geography are right now.

1309
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:00,410
And thank God I'm not an economist.

1310
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,040
Yeah.
That stuff's boring isn't it?

1311
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:04,350
And it's a made up and it's not a 
science and he's all just pretend.

1312
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,290
Now what about,
um,

1313
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:10,140
I like that breakfast thing that they 
say,

1314
01:00:10,141 --> 01:00:12,000
where's your breakfast come from as good
in it?

1315
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,990
Like,
cause you said no,

1316
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:14,873
these beans.
So it's probably been prevail and like 

1317
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:17,091
that.
A cold,

1318
01:00:17,091 --> 01:00:18,540
no,
it's all sorts has gone on.

1319
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:22,710
Put your fit mind the cocoa pop where to
sugar come from?

1320
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,540
Yeah.
Titan Lyle,

1321
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:27,370
that capital of Rab scallions.
When trust as far as I could from,

1322
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,490
I still got the whip marks in their 
hands.

1323
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:31,860
So it's been,
it's been said,

1324
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,950
we are entering a post capitalist era.
Do we still live in the country side?

1325
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,810
How can I say one just after,
of course we do.

1326
01:00:36,811 --> 01:00:37,644
It's got worse than ever.
Always something that's worse than 

1327
01:00:38,851 --> 01:00:40,980
capitalism.
Maybe some sort of terrible,

1328
01:00:40,981 --> 01:00:42,960
terrible behemoth.
Some sidewalks.

1329
01:00:42,961 --> 01:00:45,400
I'm horrible monsters.
Always pretty horrible monster size,

1330
01:00:45,401 --> 01:00:46,234
so it's,
it's a monster that has some good 

1331
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:51,140
effects.
Sometimes beyonce,

1332
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,090
I don't know.
Quickbase complying with beyonce.

1333
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,380
Will the current system ultimately 
proved to be fatal to us?

1334
01:00:58,920 --> 01:00:59,753
I wish

1335
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:00,733
could say yes,
but the trouble is the capital can 

1336
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:05,510
continue under the most dire conditions 
if people don't change it.

1337
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,373
And I thought,
what's the point that people who have 

1338
01:01:06,901 --> 01:01:07,734
got to change it because I ain't going 
to change because I ain't going to 

1339
01:01:08,901 --> 01:01:10,070
change it.
Resounded Gourd.

1340
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,300
Right,
and I have to change.

1341
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,633
What are some of the main contradictions
at the heart cath is we really covered 

1342
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:17,540
that with the growth and the dynamism.
Garraffa car believed that they could go

1343
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:18,590
after the,
he does all of these.

1344
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,080
The producer,
he's been reading it very hard.

1345
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:23,240
Could you ever love me,
Kara?

1346
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,120
Thought,
where are you going?

1347
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:24,993
Really?
What about the argument that says 

1348
01:01:26,931 --> 01:01:29,600
capitalism's contradictions lead to the 
innovations?

1349
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:30,950
They may do it resilient.
That's good.

1350
01:01:30,951 --> 01:01:31,940
Where'd you get that from?

1351
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:33,540
Yeah.
Well,

1352
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:34,743
you know,
look,

1353
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:35,623
and there's a lot of reinvention going 
on at the capitalism and it's very 

1354
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:38,580
useful.
It's very useful.

1355
01:01:38,581 --> 01:01:39,414
I mean,
why would we do without velcro and 

1356
01:01:40,651 --> 01:01:41,484
things like that?

1357
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,820
No crowd.
I see an example.

1358
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,250
It's trivial things like that.
But on the other hand,

1359
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:51,660
if you're struggling and you've got a 
broken arm and you need to fix it up and

1360
01:01:51,661 --> 01:01:53,700
he'd wear Velcro,
boy is it good?

1361
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,593
Ah,
I said my stuff wanting to cut over 

1362
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,430
giving.
Given this entire interview,

1363
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:02,030
you write about how cities are both the 
heart of capitol and class struggles are

1364
01:02:02,341 --> 01:02:05,880
cs.
You rubber has cities of both capital.

1365
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,300
He write about how cities are the half 
both capital and class struggles.

1366
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:10,283
How am I cities be reorganized in Moss?
Actually just an ecologically saying 

1367
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:13,620
ways.
One of

1368
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:17,790
the big projects I think though we've 
got to have is how to redesign cities so

1369
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:19,890
that they're much more,
uh,

1370
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:24,810
available to the population where they 
count the island nations,

1371
01:02:24,811 --> 01:02:27,750
which currently exists to bound urban 
life.

1372
01:02:27,751 --> 01:02:31,650
And actually it's interesting if you 
look at it over the last 30 years,

1373
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:35,240
most of the big movements gone around 
the world have been urban movements.

1374
01:02:35,241 --> 01:02:38,970
And I gazey park about what happened in,
in Brazil,

1375
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:39,804
uh,
and,

1376
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,090
and uh,
2013,

1377
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,560
uh,
you know,

1378
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:46,560
so,
and even occupy was a much from a lot of

1379
01:02:46,561 --> 01:02:47,394
it was about housing and urban questions
and not about what's going on in the 

1380
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:52,074
factory.

1381
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,120
Hmm.
That's interesting.

1382
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,740
I wonder what that means.

1383
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,053
It means that actually the people are as
concerned about the qualities of urban 

1384
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,480
urban life as they are about the 
qualities of a,

1385
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:05,530
their employment.
Yeah.

1386
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,920
They've always,
they've always been involved in both,

1387
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:12,540
but one of the things that marks was a 
bit of bias towards is he biased towards

1388
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:15,490
production and not necessarily because 
the timing is right.

1389
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,160
Yeah.
So,

1390
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:19,860
so I would always want to correct that.
Have it in March

1391
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,083
perhaps.
Because now the kind of economies in 

1392
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:23,094
which these movements were occurring,
there is no longer sort of mass 

1393
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:27,610
production in a manner in which there 
was men.

1394
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:28,453
Marx was writing now,

1395
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,700
okay multiverse.
And in many parts of the world,

1396
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,220
the working class in the sense of 
factory libraries,

1397
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:37,123
there's disappeared as being central.
And if it's not in China or Bangladesh 

1398
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:42,540
and so on,
but uh,

1399
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:45,150
in North America traditional working 
class,

1400
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,350
it's been much diminished.

1401
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,560
Yeah.
He separately say Paul Gilbert was,

1402
01:03:48,561 --> 01:03:49,331
he pulled up,
he said,

1403
01:03:49,331 --> 01:03:52,370
ah,
land yard of land,

1404
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:55,140
yard class,
the needs of working class.

1405
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:57,380
Really interesting thing we had when 
we're doing interviews,

1406
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:58,603
sounds of dance capital capital's we now
call it of course now that d and making 

1407
01:04:02,031 --> 01:04:03,430
that kicking,
oh,

1408
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:07,760
curly curly have sought sensitive as an 
eight crash is Marxism on the rise.

1409
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:10,360
I think there's a much greater interest 
in it.

1410
01:04:10,361 --> 01:04:11,940
And I think a,
it,

1411
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:12,923
the [inaudible] idea was in the 1990s 
when it was very hard to get anybody to 

1412
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:20,590
have a look at Alex's capital,
but I think,

1413
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:22,160
uh,
since 2000,

1414
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,280
it's,
it's gradually come important.

1415
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:27,490
And then the crisis of 2007 2008 yeah.

1416
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:29,053
Hey,
some of these big arguments against 

1417
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:30,824
communism in the 20th century has been 
directly responsible for killing 100 

1418
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:34,970
million people.
Did it?

1419
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:36,863
Yeah.
This has a lot of things that can be 

1420
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,330
very negative things,
you know,

1421
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:43,620
religion in and of course mal made a 
huge mistake,

1422
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:48,830
which led to the great famine in China.
About 20 million people died focus,

1423
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:50,611
you know?
But,

1424
01:04:50,611 --> 01:04:52,710
but on the other hand,
it also saved a lot of lives.

1425
01:04:52,711 --> 01:04:53,544
I mean,
the interesting thing about even about 

1426
01:04:54,661 --> 01:04:55,494
the China case,
when people get mad at me when I say 

1427
01:04:56,701 --> 01:04:57,241
this,
yeah,

1428
01:04:57,241 --> 01:04:58,074
okay,
20 million people probably died in the 

1429
01:04:59,281 --> 01:05:00,114
famine,
which was unnecessary bad policies and 

1430
01:05:01,891 --> 01:05:02,724
all that stood on the other hand where 
mal came to power life expectancy in 

1431
01:05:06,061 --> 01:05:06,894
China was 35 and when he died and life 
expectancy was 65 so he did something 

1432
01:05:11,281 --> 01:05:12,120
right as well as,

1433
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,160
yes,
I see.

1434
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:14,023
You feel like it's your personal role to
address much of the propagandized 

1435
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:17,960
information was taken as

1436
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,083
another photo of the public eye on it.
It emphasizes all the negatives and it 

1437
01:05:22,471 --> 01:05:24,550
never says anything about what the 
positives were.

1438
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,240
Balanced propaganda.
On the other hand,

1439
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:34,450
I understand one capitalist economies 
are based on free exchange.

1440
01:05:34,451 --> 01:05:36,760
This is a popular claim of capitalism.
Is that true?

1441
01:05:36,761 --> 01:05:37,594
Is it made up?

1442
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,750
Well in principle it is,
but in practice a lot of it is monopoly,

1443
01:05:42,751 --> 01:05:43,400
power,

1444
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,010
monopoly,
power plus even people's and the role of

1445
01:05:46,011 --> 01:05:49,160
the consumer and they've been stimulated
into a terrible state of desperation.

1446
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,560
Um,
I think we've covered it.

1447
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,140
I think this is such a thorough 
interview I've done now.

1448
01:05:54,141 --> 01:05:55,910
It kinda just before,
I mean not,

1449
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:58,280
not that we let you go,
your continued to be free,

1450
01:05:58,281 --> 01:06:00,230
but my mate John Rogers sent me this 
thing,

1451
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:02,210
check out this and see if it makes 
sense.

1452
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:04,070
Uh,
like a blah blah blah.

1453
01:06:04,071 --> 01:06:04,904
I meet out in Malin you in respect of 
this project we are hoping you could 

1454
01:06:07,821 --> 01:06:08,654
speak to Russel about here.
I'm Russell and probably close to his 

1455
01:06:10,701 --> 01:06:11,534
heart.
This is a number of people in Harringay 

1456
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:13,243
have formed a company with the aim of 
buying a large bit of land that would 

1457
01:06:16,251 --> 01:06:17,990
otherwise be sold to a private 
developer.

1458
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:19,183
They will want to build loads of 
expensive housing and a part of 

1459
01:06:20,871 --> 01:06:24,150
Harringay Tottenham,
I mean just as call it north London,

1460
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:25,010
it's not antagonize.

1461
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:25,903
Most of the other people in London where
I'm just a big football insights were 

1462
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:30,524
local people can't afford them lost 
gentrifying the area and kicking out 

1463
01:06:32,631 --> 01:06:34,640
local people.
What we want to do is build 800 times.

1464
01:06:34,641 --> 01:06:35,474
They're all genuinely affordable for 
local people and the site controlled by 

1465
01:06:38,301 --> 01:06:40,850
local people or low,
I could go on,

1466
01:06:40,851 --> 01:06:41,684
he says,
but if you need more info you can go to 

1467
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:47,230
the websites,
start hiring guide or Co.

1468
01:06:47,231 --> 01:06:47,721
Dot.
UK.

1469
01:06:47,721 --> 01:06:51,050
We are actually serious about this as a 
funny paragraph to put this late in.

1470
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:52,820
Uh,
we've got,

1471
01:06:52,821 --> 01:06:54,680
we've got solicitors,
architects,

1472
01:06:54,681 --> 01:06:56,930
we've been speaking to the mayor about 
blah blah blah blah.

1473
01:06:56,931 --> 01:06:58,960
We need to pry pile on pressure and 
publicity.

1474
01:06:58,961 --> 01:06:59,794
So what do you think about project like 
that where essentially I suppose their 

1475
01:07:01,701 --> 01:07:02,534
project is to have sort of a,
to acquire some land to build 800 times 

1476
01:07:07,581 --> 01:07:09,050
and sort of govern them.
So again,

1477
01:07:09,051 --> 01:07:09,884
he's going to be operating within like a
metropolis that's got other systems of 

1478
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:13,580
government aid his heart.

1479
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:14,920
Um,
uh,

1480
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,360
you know,
I'd love to know more details.

1481
01:07:16,361 --> 01:07:21,361
Like you don't just make snap judgments 
like a [inaudible] support,

1482
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:25,270
this kind of thing.
I mean,

1483
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,300
in the states we have something called 
community land trust,

1484
01:07:28,301 --> 01:07:30,460
which takes,
which means that people who are in those

1485
01:07:30,461 --> 01:07:31,294
houses can't sell them.
So I don't know whether that's in that 

1486
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,040
proposal where the people are the 
easier,

1487
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:37,810
they can't turn a quick profit on their 
host.

1488
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:38,710
So,
so,

1489
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:39,701
uh,
you know,

1490
01:07:39,701 --> 01:07:41,500
if,
if people come in and they live there,

1491
01:07:41,501 --> 01:07:44,020
then if I leave,
then they just get back what they put in

1492
01:07:44,021 --> 01:07:44,854
and I,
there's no kind of speculation on the 

1493
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,490
land.
So anything of that sort.

1494
01:07:47,491 --> 01:07:48,750
I'm in five fiverr off.
Yeah,

1495
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,593
people were,
but people have authority and power in 

1496
01:07:51,221 --> 01:07:54,130
their own lives and the ability to 
govern themselves with possible.

1497
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:54,964
But if they,
but we sometimes find in those things 

1498
01:07:57,401 --> 01:07:59,140
where people look at the situation and 
say,

1499
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:00,400
well,
under the rules of the game,

1500
01:08:00,401 --> 01:08:02,680
I can't sell and,
but if I could sell,

1501
01:08:02,681 --> 01:08:03,514
I could make mega bucks.
So therefore individuals tried to then 

1502
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:10,450
turn those collective things into things
where they can speculate and come out.

1503
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:11,290
I mean,

1504
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:12,123
isn't it cause in a way capitalism,
like most and observable phenomena as 

1505
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:21,020
somehow sourced from the,
our inner lives of fear,

1506
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:21,980
greed.

1507
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:22,791
Well,
it's partly that,

1508
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:23,690
but then,
you know,

1509
01:08:23,691 --> 01:08:24,524
if,
if somebody is living there and I see 

1510
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:26,624
that if they could make this better,
turn this back into a market 

1511
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:29,803
proposition,
they could make a lot of money out of 

1512
01:08:30,921 --> 01:08:31,754
it,
then,

1513
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:33,800
you know,
and they got pressing needs,

1514
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:34,634
you know,
medical needs or something like that or 

1515
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,750
well then,
then,

1516
01:08:38,751 --> 01:08:40,010
uh,
they want to go market.

1517
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:41,111
Yes,
yes,

1518
01:08:41,111 --> 01:08:41,881
yes.
I see.

1519
01:08:41,881 --> 01:08:42,714
So

1520
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:43,910
greed and,
and,

1521
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,860
and,
and an ideology and so on.

1522
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:47,540
People have real kind of needs.

1523
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:50,210
I suppose that's why you,
uh,

1524
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:51,044
I insistent on there being some kind of 
state roles so that there is some sort 

1525
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:55,214
of overarching principle.
So legal apparatus there that prevents 

1526
01:08:58,881 --> 01:08:59,714
them selling out at a market rate.
That's some free advice from David 

1527
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,450
Harvey that you've got there from you.
And you know,

1528
01:09:04,451 --> 01:09:06,350
there are some called Tony [inaudible] 
who's a friend of my mate,

1529
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:10,370
John Rogers.
And finally what five books we've got to

1530
01:09:10,371 --> 01:09:11,690
read.
It's a terrible,

1531
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,130
terrible,
terrible.

1532
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,200
Um,
but yeah,

1533
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:18,360
you should get an reading this stuff 
from any,

1534
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:20,340
all kinds of different perspectives.
Uh,

1535
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,233
and,
and the sorts of things I would so say 

1536
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:24,340
is,
uh,

1537
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:25,173
you know,
if you read a clr james on a black 

1538
01:09:28,981 --> 01:09:30,210
Jacobins,
uh,

1539
01:09:30,211 --> 01:09:34,830
you know this,
I mean this is a common understanding.

1540
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:36,900
It's an understanding of marks.
It comes from,

1541
01:09:36,901 --> 01:09:39,420
from the colonial experience,
put it that way.

1542
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:43,440
And so anybody is coming from that 
background I think would immediately get

1543
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:44,303
sucked into sort of appreciating the 
marks is standpoint from that 

1544
01:09:47,971 --> 01:09:48,804
experience.
I say the same thing about something 

1545
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:56,310
Sunday like Silvia Federici who has a 
book on Kaliban and the witch and,

1546
01:09:56,311 --> 01:09:57,144
and another more recent one called 0.0,
which is about the experience of women 

1547
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:01,373
and the whole history of capital 
accumulation from the very origins to 

1548
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,360
two today.
Again,

1549
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:07,463
you know,
people who will get into that and I 

1550
01:10:09,481 --> 01:10:11,680
would get a person and perspective on 
the marks,

1551
01:10:11,681 --> 01:10:13,560
his position,
which would come from,

1552
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:14,423
from that.

1553
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:15,490
And then I,
you know,

1554
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,520
for a,
a humanist position,

1555
01:10:17,521 --> 01:10:20,490
I'd say read Terry Eagleton spoke on,
uh,

1556
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,610
why Marx was right.
Uh,

1557
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:26,280
wear marks where he actually goes over 
the whole history of,

1558
01:10:26,281 --> 01:10:27,240
uh,
of,

1559
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,133
of,
of Marxists humanists positions that he 

1560
01:10:29,881 --> 01:10:30,714
took on,
why he was right and corrects a lot of 

1561
01:10:33,481 --> 01:10:35,850
the bad propaganda that we've talked 
about.

1562
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,110
And then I leave for it.
And then I,

1563
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,390
then I'd say,
then I'd say,

1564
01:10:39,391 --> 01:10:41,100
actually,
I'm going to give you a couple of mine.

1565
01:10:41,101 --> 01:10:44,160
I think you should.
You should take a this last one,

1566
01:10:44,161 --> 01:10:46,230
which is uh,
uh,

1567
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:49,080
yeah,
Marx capital and the madness of economic

1568
01:10:49,081 --> 01:10:50,550
reason,
eh,

1569
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:54,620
but then I will it by reading the brief 
history of neoliberalism,

1570
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:59,040
which is about the history of capital 
accumulation from an 1970s onwards,

1571
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:02,850
but it got out to about 2005 so it was 
before the crisis,

1572
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:08,240
whereas the new book has a final chapter
which updates the neo liberalism.

1573
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:12,900
Bocomez happens in neoliberalism since 
2005 so I would say,

1574
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,093
you know,
you would get into get into things that 

1575
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:20,040
wise expedition of learning.
I'm going to start with yours professor.

1576
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:22,500
Thank you so much for coming on the air 
for having me.

1577
01:11:22,501 --> 01:11:25,770
This has been great.
We did you say I've been great.

1578
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,260
Always been great.
All right,

1579
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,133
brilliant.
Thanks.

1580
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,030
Hey,
we,

1581
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,863
why don't we go on?
You read in this monologue from 

1582
01:11:31,231 --> 01:11:34,200
Shakespeare that you've concluded that's
right out of King John.

1583
01:11:34,201 --> 01:11:36,840
How come you saw king John saw King 
John?

1584
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:37,674
Because a friend of mine took me there 
to listen to it and it's not a great 

1585
01:11:40,831 --> 01:11:41,760
place.
You're on the other hand,

1586
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:43,300
there's this great speech in the middle 
of it.

1587
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:48,850
It goes like this mad world,
mad king's mad composition,

1588
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:53,670
that's smooth face gentlemen tickling 
commodity commodity,

1589
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:57,540
the bias of the world,
the world who have itself is pasted well

1590
01:11:57,541 --> 01:12:01,320
made to run even upon even ground to 
illicit vantage.

1591
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,680
This vile drawing by us,
this sway of motion,

1592
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:09,720
this commodity makes it take heed from 
all in different see from all direction,

1593
01:12:09,721 --> 01:12:12,900
purpose,
course intent and this same bias,

1594
01:12:12,901 --> 01:12:14,790
this commodity,
this board,

1595
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:15,624
this broker,
this all changing word and why re ally 

1596
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:22,470
on this commodity but for,
because he has not wooed me yet.

1597
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:23,603
Now that I have the power to catch my 
hand when his for angels was sort of my 

1598
01:12:26,611 --> 01:12:27,444
palm but for my hand is an attempted yet
like a poor beggar ray Ellis on the 

1599
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:33,550
rich.
Well wiles,

1600
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,393
I'm a beggar.
I will rail and say here is no sin but 

1601
01:12:36,751 --> 01:12:37,584
to be rich and being enriched.
My virtue then shall be to say there is 

1602
01:12:40,951 --> 01:12:45,951
no vice but beggary since king's break,
faith upon commodity gain be my Lord for

1603
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:50,580
idol worship Thee.
Yes,

1604
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,160
it's a great quote.
And of course,

1605
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:57,300
the first line of Marx's Kapital is,
I'll look to me for that.

1606
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,673
You're the first line is that the wealth
of the world in which we're looking at 

1607
01:13:05,701 --> 01:13:09,870
here appears and have greater 
accumulation of commodities.

1608
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,600
Ri Shakespeare,
Karl Marx,

1609
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:13,434
professor David Harvey,
thank you very much for joining us on 

1610
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:17,334
under the skin has been a great 
component in a wonderful education for 

1611
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:22,830
me to chase.
Thanks mate.
