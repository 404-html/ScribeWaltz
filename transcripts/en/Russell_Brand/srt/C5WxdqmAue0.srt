John peretti is an investigative 
journalist and broadcaster who's award

00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:04,974
winning television series include the 
men who might have spent the super rich 

3
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:12,630
and us and trillium pound island.
He's written articles for the Guardian,

wired and the Huffington post and his 
book done the secret deals that are 

5
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:18,354
changing our world,
tells the story of the billion dollar 

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,190
handshakes that never make the news by 
revolutionizing everything we do.

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,990
What?
Welcome to our show.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:28,801
Thank you.
Bless.

9
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:31,560
Bless you for inviting me.
We're really thrilled that you're here.

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,643
I'm just give you a quick understanding 
of like what my motivation is at 

11
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:38,694
university,
doing a course religion in global 

12
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:41,781
politics,
Sal,

13
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:43,080
as universities,
really,

14
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:43,914
really enjoying it.
Getting an academic understanding of 

15
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:50,040
things that are intuitively understood 
for a little while now.

16
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:50,874
Like your field of expertise is often 
submerged financial narrative that's 

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,140
actually governing and dominate in our 
world from an ecological perspective.

18
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,580
Uh,
a media can,

19
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,423
can you follow the money?
That's all you need to do that old 

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,760
cliche,
but it's.

21
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:14,070
But it happens to be a cliche for a 
reason,

22
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:14,904
which is if you follow the money and you
understand where the money's coming 

23
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:19,110
from,
who's making the money,

24
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,173
what the economics underlying everything
we do from the coffee we buy to the job 

25
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:25,464
we go to.
It's why we decided to buy that phone 

26
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:28,404
over over another phone.
All of these things have economics of 

27
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:31,554
their heart.
And so if you don't understand 

28
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:33,054
economics,
you don't understand how the world 

29
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:36,810
works.
What then should we understand about the

30
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:40,320
world is we're experiencing it now.
What are the,

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,680
who are the dominant economic players 
that are determining what happens in the

32
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:49,470
lives of ordinary people?
Well,

33
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:50,400
I think we are.
I mean,

34
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,310
trump has thrown a kind of spanner in 
the works and he's kind of,

35
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,173
you know,
I suppose what that represents as we 

36
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:56,784
know,
is it represents of kind of dislocation 

37
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:01,110
of the old,
the old status quo.

38
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,940
But that was because that wasn't 
working.

39
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:05,760
And essentially what we've had over the 
last 40 years,

40
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:10,440
and he's a kind of,
I suppose a symptom or public a creation

41
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,850
is,
is um,

42
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,830
what we call corporate capture,
which was,

43
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:14,664
I suppose that's the creeping end of 
government elected government and the 

44
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,360
rise of global corporations.
And we kind of know about that.

45
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,523
But I think what's really interesting 
about that for me is that corporations 

46
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,773
haven't done this.
I'm out of some kind of evil 

47
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:30,804
machiavellian plot is just,
it's just been a kind of failure of 

48
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:34,134
government to be able to,
to run the countries that they 

49
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:37,950
supposedly run.
You have.

50
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,090
You have a world that I see is kind of 
the,

51
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,023
the operates on two different levels.
You have horizontally and corporations 

52
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:49,470
who operate across the globe.
So they don't have any,

53
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:51,840
they don't have any need to worry about 
territorial boundaries.

54
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,883
Governments operate vertically.
They operate within the narrow 

55
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:58,620
constraints of the geographical state of
which they operate.

56
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,723
The two just don't meet.
And I think as the world's become 

57
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,380
increasingly globalized,
corporations have just got the whip hand

58
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,480
and essentially government has become a 
kind of civil service for corporations.

59
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,170
So the nation state,
which is a relatively modern idea,

60
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,590
is already been made in empower terms 
redundant because of the global power of

61
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:27,121
transnational corporations and the sort 
of resurgence of an f,

62
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,970
no identity politics.
He's just sort of a response to that.

63
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,590
So who,
who are the corporation,

64
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,120
I think that that's not,
you know,

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,233
I think that's what's interesting about 
that is that that's just the kind of 

66
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:44,980
logic of the way economics has gone,
you know,

67
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:47,350
I mean if you look at,
if you look at Putin,

68
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,470
he's really,
he's not really the leader of Russia,

69
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:50,570
what?

70
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,570
He's the CEO of Russia Plc.
Trump is the ceo of a corporation called

71
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:58,800
the United States,
you know,

72
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,793
and so I think it's interesting that we 
have business people in autocrats who 

73
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:04,894
are increasingly coming to prominence 
because there's a kind of almost 

74
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:11,830
implicit realization that that's the way
the state has to be run.

75
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,800
So iT's not as sort of right kind of 
thing.

76
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:15,634
It's just that that's the nature of the 
way the world is going to mimic 

77
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,750
corporate models because the corporate 
model is now the dominant model.

78
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:26,320
They stay idea sort of redundant,
that make sense now and we know that,

79
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:30,120
but we Can't admit that bEcause 
Otherwise democracy becomes a explicitly

80
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:31,090
a fast.
Absolutely.

81
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:33,910
And you had that under the,
under the cameron and under blair,

82
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:34,744
you had the first sort of intimations of
this where they started talking about 

83
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:40,240
the John Lewis model or you know,
they'd start to say,

84
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,490
oh,
what if britain was run like John Lewis,

85
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,920
you know,
and then that sort of got the adverts.

86
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,630
Exactly.
And now it's become the google model.

87
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:50,710
So it's like,
how come you know,

88
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,110
how can I.
And I went to this conference where,

89
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,130
which was basically run by,
it was organized by big corporate,

90
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,010
big corporations and they asked me to go
and speak to them and I said,

91
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:01,870
well said,
have you not seen my documentaries?

92
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:03,530
You know why you're asking me to come 
into something.

93
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,383
Well,
we were interested in what you had to 

94
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,124
say and the way they were talking,
they were talking aboUt corporate tax 

95
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:11,500
specifically about corporation tax and 
the avoidance,

96
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:14,380
which is an issue in the air remains an 
issue in the air.

97
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,240
They were sort of saying,
you know,

98
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,123
tax is such a redundant idea.
It'S such an inefficient way of 

99
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,160
collecting money from us.
We don't want to pay it.

100
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,990
Governments don't know how to collect 
it.

101
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,570
Why don't we run the nhs,
you know,

102
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:30,010
why don't we just do it directly?

103
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,993
and the sort of what was staggerIng was 
the kind of the breadth of their 

104
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,534
ambition.
They didn't see any limits on what they 

105
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,060
should be doing.
Well,

106
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,620
we had professor David Harvey,
a marxist professor in here,

107
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,180
and he says that sort of stitched into 
the ideology of capitalism,

108
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:46,014
which obviously I need to tell you,
but to reiterate for our listeners is 

109
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,920
the idea of infinite limitless growth,
like marxist theory,

110
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,200
origin points out the floor,
that we've got limited resources.

111
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:58,790
So inevitably capitalism will have the 
mast itself.

112
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,624
We're going to need a critical theory 
that continually exposes the fallacy of 

113
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:06,980
a model that as infinite growth.
But what happened was an amazing moment.

114
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:07,980
I mean,
when you look at disposal,

115
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,190
you know,
disposable consumerism and I mean,

116
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:11,024
you mean if you look at the way that the
planet is going in terms of limited 

117
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:14,504
resources and what's ultimately going to
consumers and you just make things that 

118
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,880
we throw away,
so stuff that we bought,

119
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,240
you know,
things that we buy cheaply.

120
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,890
So the rise of,
you know,

121
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,090
the whole rise of high street riser,
prime art,

122
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,310
tk maxx,
you know,

123
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,150
little,
all these,

124
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:26,984
all these,
these brands that basically produce 

125
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:31,430
goods that we could buy cheaply.
When you look at that moment,

126
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,400
2000,
around about 2000 and chemo has the very

127
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:37,520
moment where global economies are 
beginning to stagnate.

128
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,623
Wages are beginning to freeze.
What we'd had was 40 years of quote 

129
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:42,404
unquote growth where prices rose,
but so did wages in tandem with it at 

130
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:48,680
that moment.
suddenly what happens,

131
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,693
wages freeze.
people's living standards can no longer 

132
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:53,900
increase.
So what do we do?

133
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,240
We make products that cost next to 
nothing.

134
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:59,390
So people have the appearance of 
improving living standards,

135
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,370
but products just getting cheaper and 
cheaper.

136
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:03,230
And of course the price is paid by the 
planet.

137
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,170
And so this is like,
these are kind of the economics,

138
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,950
underlying consumerism underlying where 
we are right now,

139
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,970
who are the most powerful global 
corporations,

140
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,480
well,
when we talk to be,

141
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,660
or it used to be the oil companies and 
the mining companies and uh,

142
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,360
and the retail and so,
and food unilever.

143
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,880
So unilever,
monsanto,

144
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:27,560
nestlé,
coca cola,

145
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,380
those companies run through.
Those were the big ones.

146
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,070
Yeah.
And what's extraordinary,

147
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,260
um,
uh,

148
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,290
oxfam did an amazing graphic where 
basically what they've done is taken the

149
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,253
600 or so biggest companies on the 
planet and then they've drawn their 

150
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:48,920
connections to the bigger company that 
owns them.

151
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,881
Right?
So it's like,

152
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:50,714
is this extraordinary family tree which 
ends up with literally five companies 

153
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,280
running everything and you think that's,
you know,

154
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,100
that's like,
you know,

155
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,230
if you wanted to believe in conspiracy 
theories,

156
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:00,900
well,
you know,

157
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,030
just look at the graphics.
So,

158
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:02,501
you know,
it's not,

159
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:03,334
you don't have to believe you conspiracy
theories to understand that very few 

160
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:09,350
companies are in charge of everything.
But now in the last,

161
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,910
you know,
15 years,

162
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:12,830
what we've seen is the rise of the tech 
companies.

163
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:14,540
Obviously,
you know google,

164
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,180
apple,
microsoft,

165
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,313
amazon,
these are the companies that now people 

166
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:20,564
consider to be the most powerful 
companies on the and are the most 

167
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:27,080
powerful because of what they own for 
the future.

168
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,760
They'll own data,
they own data,

169
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,480
they own everything.
Everything there is to know about all of

170
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,700
us,
so prospectively the most powerful it is

171
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,850
saying that the way that we evaluate 
power is changing.

172
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,684
It's not necessarily now about capital.
It's about potential power because of 

173
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,860
data.
Data is the new oil.

174
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,830
Data is the new oil because the set.
Why?

175
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,140
Well,
because it's the most precious commodity

176
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:54,500
on the planet because if you own data 
that means you go to market specifically

177
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,040
to people you can control them and

178
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,140
you control their consumer.

179
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,990
Got russell brand's house and russell 
brand's houses.

180
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:00,843
Heating is controlled by a phone which 
collects all the data and then collects 

181
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:06,034
all the data and what you buy collects 
all the data and where you've been for 

182
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:09,724
the last 48 hours.
They know absolutely everything or will 

183
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:15,730
know absolutely everything there is to 
know about you,

184
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,710
what you buy,
what you do,

185
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,450
what you liked,
what you disliked,

186
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,950
that that is power.

187
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,043
Because what I heard is that sort of 
maybe the word I heard that the uber 

188
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:28,660
furcation,
that people will know that the way you,

189
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,930
if once they know your habits and your 
patterns,

190
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,210
then like that there could be a sliding 
scale of,

191
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,260
oh,
you need a plumber,

192
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:37,350
do you will it's christmas eve.
That's a thousand pounds.

193
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:38,184
You could afford to pay it.
That you can have a kind of a flexible 

194
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:41,544
capitalism that's responding to the 
consumer and extracting as much as 

195
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:46,380
possible.
What I suppose is,

196
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,650
so one of the things that you seem to 
suggest early jack,

197
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,710
is that without some oppositional force,
the limitless growth of corporatism will

198
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:57,144
devour everything and we're already at a
point where it's devouring the planet 

199
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,583
itself and the traditionally we would 
imagine the opposing force to be 

200
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:08,760
provided by the state,
but the state has now become essentially

201
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:12,810
the administrator for,
for corporate is so that that opposition

202
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:13,600
won't be variety.

203
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,630
What you've seen with,
you know,

204
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,270
and it's not the first person to say 
this,

205
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:17,920
but you know,
when you see brexit and trump,

206
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:22,630
you see in a kind of sorts of 
inarticulated response to the end of the

207
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:23,464
state,
you see people wanting to take power 

208
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:28,360
back because they can sense an end,
but they don't,

209
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,740
you know.
Do you see what I mean?

210
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:30,574
There's a,
there's a sense in which the state has 

211
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:33,580
lost its potency.
Yes.

212
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,740
Before we can articulate it,
we know it.

213
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,520
We know it's felt and people understand 
it and so,

214
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,620
but I think.
I think what someone says,

215
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,520
w one entrepreneur said rather 
chillingly and brilliantly to me,

216
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:46,354
he said,
what we do is we invent a problem and 

217
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:53,230
then provide the solution.
And so that's really what a lot of these

218
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:54,064
products are about.
When you talk about data and you talk 

219
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:56,194
about the plumber and so on,
what you really want to do is you want 

220
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:01,460
to start giving people options that they
never knew they had what like.

221
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,490
So for instance,
you know,

222
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,520
if you watched this series,
you're going to like this series.

223
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:08,800
If you like that series,
you would want to go on this holiday.

224
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,080
If you want to go on that holiday,
you would like to buy this car.

225
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:11,914
If you want to buy this car,
you might like to go dating these 27 

226
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:18,460
different women.
You know there's an endless endless tree

227
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,323
that can be opened up in terms of what 
your consumer decisions will be off the 

228
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:24,500
back of one consumer.

229
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,613
It's and it's like,
but you're trapped on a plateau of 

230
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:28,574
consumerism continually.
You don't have another role in your 

231
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,624
life.
Your role is to consume shopping is 

232
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,920
everything because you know when George 
Bush was asked after nine slash 11,

233
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,010
what could the public do after nine,
11 twin towers?

234
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,510
He said,
go shopping.

235
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,980
That's the solution.
Helping

236
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,813
wasn't a frivolous thing.
Grows shopping is actually what elon 

237
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,130
musk solution is to the road,
to the automation.

238
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,873
He says that essentially the only thing 
we can do productive to the economy is 

239
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:00,490
spend money.
Consumerism is what it's all based upon.

240
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,610
Debt is absolutely at the heart of it,
so the.

241
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,503
So the increasing debt that we have goes
hand in hand with the need for us to 

242
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:10,780
continue buying stuff.
And so what you'll come to elon musk has

243
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:13,890
said will be paid a universal wage for 
doing,

244
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,570
for basically going shopping once robots
do everything,

245
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,583
robots will be taxed,
we'll get the money and then we'll go 

246
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:21,460
down to prime arc.
And that's,

247
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,230
that is the future for humanity.

248
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,133
That george w dot bush moment,
it's curious coming as it did off the 

249
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:34,181
back of a seismic event that,
that represented in so many ways,

250
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:38,360
perhaps some unseen,
a cultural clash that,

251
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,350
uh,
that he's,

252
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,490
uh,
a response to.

253
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:45,491
It was go shopping it,
it is the modern equivalent of saying,

254
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,410
pray,
go and pray because that,

255
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,333
that is our ideology.
That is when we talk about extremism in 

256
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:56,180
the more obvious forms of religious 
extremism,

257
00:12:56,181 --> 00:13:00,430
we seem unaware that the dominant 
extremist ideologies,

258
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,630
one where we are consumers and like you 
said,

259
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,620
entering potentially into a time where 
you are nothing but a consumer.

260
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,530
Absolutely.
And I think this I think was interesting

261
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:10,364
is when we moved to online shopping,
what's that gonna do to the cathedrals 

262
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:13,820
of consumerism,
you know,

263
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:14,654
the shopping centers,
these places where we go to worship the 

264
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:18,404
god of shopping because in a sense that 
that replacement of god with shopping 

265
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,113
has been with us for half a century.
It's kind of what we know and we're at 

266
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:29,840
a.
We're shopping is a profound,

267
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:30,674
is a profound thing.
It's not only profound in terms of how 

268
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:33,674
the economy operates,
it's also profound in terms of what it 

269
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,070
does neurologically to us.
You know,

270
00:13:37,071 --> 00:13:40,550
we talk glibly about shopping addiction,
retail therapy and so on,

271
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,830
but those feelings,
that endorphin rush,

272
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:45,680
you know,
that release of happiness that has to be

273
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:46,514
replicated,
that addiction and you know about this 

274
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:48,861
stuff,
you know,

275
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:49,694
that addiction to that feeling has to be
replicated faster and faster and more 

276
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:57,500
often and more often the shopping is at 
the heart of who we are,

277
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,250
how we define ourselves in relation to 
our neighbors and our friends.

278
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,700
It's absolutely everything.
It's the heart of capitalism.

279
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,610
Yes,
yes.

280
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,463
It's the way that we,

281
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,520
the way we see ourselves,
if we're not consuming,

282
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:10,050
we're not existing.
Now,

283
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,060
whilst I see the the economic analysis 
that you're conducting is the.

284
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,900
It seems to me is the truest way of 
understanding this problem.

285
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:22,890
It's valid,
it's demonstrable,

286
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:24,930
it's scientific.
You can go look,

287
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,083
this is where power is.
Look at how it's responding to look at 

288
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:29,940
the decisions that are being made.
Look at this reality.

289
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,983
Look at these deals.
That's why you're living in this 

290
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:33,684
reality.
That's the way that's a way of tracing 

291
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:36,930
it to.
In terms of change,

292
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,973
it seems that we are very difficult to 
implement change on an economic level 

293
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:45,891
because there isn't by definition or all
of the power is held by people that want

294
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:47,340
to maintain these systems.

295
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,140
I think if you understand why they got 
to the place it's in,

296
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,063
which was money,
you understand how money is perhaps the 

297
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:56,390
only way that will get us out.
You know,

298
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:59,190
I spoke to peter teal who created paypal
rallies.

299
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,310
There's silicon valley billionaire.
He said,

300
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:02,144
the whole problem with the way we framed
global warming has been in terms of a 

301
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:07,340
moral argument.
We've put we,

302
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:08,840
we,
we've said to the public,

303
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,450
this is bad,
people don't care.

304
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,420
Daniel condom and the behavioral 
economists said,

305
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,900
there's an extraordinary moment.
Basically when the,

306
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,640
when a problem is too far away,
we don't deal with it.

307
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,440
When it's too close,
it's too late.

308
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,563
He said there's a window of opportunity 
where something can be done and that's 

309
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,890
literally where we are with earth right 
now.

310
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,730
But you see the pizza go back to the 
pizza.

311
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,760
What pizza tail was saying?
He said,

312
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,713
if there's money to be made from saving 
earth that believe you me will have 

313
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:39,470
clouds with avn logos on them.
We'll have cows with,

314
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,410
you know,
a monsanto logos on them.

315
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,130
You know,
if,

316
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:43,963
if that's what's required to sort the 
earth out is to find a way of making 

317
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:49,970
money from the salvation of the earth.
And that's the way forward.

318
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,240
Yes.
But that's slightly bleak view.

319
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:59,740
But another quote that recurs in this 
program is,

320
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,663
it's easier to envisage the end of the 
world than the identity is invisible to 

321
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:04,474
the end of capitalism.
But this economically will come before 

322
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,540
the other.
It seemingly,

323
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,780
um,
uh,

324
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,833
but you know,
I can't see how it can be amended 

325
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,860
through economic means unless you sort 
of started.

326
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:17,694
We uSe for a moment that touched on the,
there are sort of biochemical 

327
00:16:20,441 --> 00:16:21,274
imperatives to purchase and spending.
We're doing it because we get a feeling 

328
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,993
inside our anatomy.
It within our consciousness for me that 

329
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,393
the opposition can only change if people
start looking at reality in a very 

330
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:35,110
different way.
That's what I think is being suggested.

331
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,093
The way that we intuitively understand 
that nation state is ending or has 

332
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:43,570
already defunct except for in a 
superficial way.

333
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,990
Uh,
I think that we,

334
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,873
we also know that huge change is 
required outside of the systems that we 

335
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,070
currently live with him.
I'm

336
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,000
kind of a believer in,
in the economics myself.

337
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:57,500
I tend to think,
you know,

338
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:00,560
I interviewed thomas pickety and a kind 
of an interesting guy,

339
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,500
the french economist in a wrote capital 
and I said to him,

340
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:04,070
what,
you know,

341
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,821
this moment,
you know,

342
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:06,230
what's to be done.
And he saId,

343
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:06,561
well,
you know,

344
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:07,920
we corporations,
we could,

345
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,210
you know,
we could create a global tax system.

346
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:12,044
We could create.
We could retool the imf and turn them 

347
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,860
into a force with teeth that could deal 
with corporate,

348
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:18,600
and I said that you're basically like 
asking for birds to go in.

349
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,200
That's not gonna happen.
And he said,

350
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:22,034
yeah,
the other thing is will we could have a 

351
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:23,840
revolution?
And I said,

352
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:24,674
well,
in what way are we going to have a 

353
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:26,204
revolution?
Because the revolution is that you look 

354
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:29,660
at traditionally,
you look at the russian revolution,

355
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:32,240
you can look at the failed 68 attempted 
to revolution.

356
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,830
What were they?
They were the.

357
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,783
They were on the on an economic rise 
where you had a prosperous middle class 

358
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,550
that was demanding more what we have 
now,

359
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:41,001
and he said,
yeah,

360
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:41,834
but what you have now is a potentially 
combustible force of a middle class who 

361
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,353
are disenfranchised from what they 
believe they're entitled to from the 

362
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:50,934
last 40 years,
plus an huge underclass of people who 

363
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,284
literally cannot exist,
and that together is a recipe for 

364
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:00,950
revolution.
That's what pickets.

365
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:03,540
He was saying,
and I think you know what you do have.

366
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,830
What we do have in history is we have 
the inevitability of change.

367
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,813
That's one thing for sure,
so whatever we feel is now the 

368
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:15,840
catastrophe of the moment we're in that 
is going to change what,

369
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,640
which way it's going to go,
who knows?

370
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:18,474
But things are becoming more dramatic.
The cycles are becoming more dramatic 

371
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,930
and as Adam Curtis said in this film 
hypernormalization,

372
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,883
we've normalized the catastrophe,
so a point where we accept that as part 

373
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:32,190
of the cycle and so that's an 
interesting thing.

374
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,213
Well,
we're talking more about revolution 

375
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,654
towards the end of our conversation,
but I emphasize and highlight now the 

376
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,623
nature of this catastrophe.
Can you explain to us what's happening 

377
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:46,480
within agriculture that demonstrates the
severity of the problem

378
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,140
you shouldn't have asked me to.
I will tell you.

379
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:51,974
It's pretty extraordinary.
It's pretty extraordinary because the 

380
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,160
other.
You shouldn't have asked me that because

381
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:58,000
I just don't want to tell people what's 
what's going on.

382
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,283
I'm so bad.
I mean basically the who did a report 

383
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,120
two years ago now,
the backdrop,

384
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,250
a lot of science that was being done 
across the globe,

385
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:11,084
they'd put sort of put it in one place 
and they basically analyzed a lake in 

386
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:15,494
the of region of France,
which had been undisturbed for a 

387
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,281
thousand years.
Really?

388
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:23,114
They looked at the sediment in that lake
and there was any kind of really 

389
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:27,470
interesting experiment.
Bear with me on this.

390
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,933
what they found was the sediment had 
been pretty much undisturbed up until 

391
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:33,734
the industrial revolution.
Then obviously things had started to 

392
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,124
change.
The nature of the sediment have changed 

393
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,044
that.
Then what happened in the last 40 years 

394
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,320
was that basically the nutrients had 
completely depleted,

395
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,430
so as a result of intensive farming of 
intensive farming,

396
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:53,210
not just to create wheat,
but also to create basically animals and

397
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:56,510
dairy.
For us to eat and consume.

398
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,303
We had leached the soil of all it's 
nutrients resulting in the fact that we 

399
00:20:01,611 --> 00:20:02,444
have just 60.
They estimated 60 harvests left in the 

400
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,704
planet.

401
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,683
Wow.
So that's sort of a sort of a food 

402
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:10,450
armageddon

403
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,430
is approaching.
Yeah,

404
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:13,630
and it's kind of learn.
And again,

405
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:14,464
you know,
when you talk to people in silicon 

406
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:16,691
valley,
they say,

407
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:17,300
you know,
we're,

408
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,880
we're across this stuff because it's an 
opportunity and you say,

409
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:23,680
well in what way is an opportunity,
synthetic soil,

410
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,120
vertical farming off I'm off world 
farming.

411
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:29,650
They're talking about the martian for 
real.

412
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:31,810
Could we turn the moon into an 
agricultural place?

413
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:34,930
Could we move all the heavy industry 
into space?

414
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,990
That's what Jeff Bezos is plan is,
you know,

415
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,740
this is the stuff that they're dealing 
with now.

416
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,860
You know,
10 years ago it was all tech.

417
00:20:41,861 --> 00:20:46,160
It was all silicon valley was all about 
going into going into the micro,

418
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,733
the details of how a phone works,
what can a phone deliver as a computer 

419
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:56,050
now it's like looking out into space.
All a super macro and that's where the r

420
00:20:56,051 --> 00:20:56,680
and d is.

421
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,513
When I think about my own life,
it's kind of evident that there is a 

422
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,263
problem just from the way that I can 
share my own is aware of these kinds of 

423
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:05,044
arguments.
But like when I figured my domestic 

424
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:07,090
waste,
I think,

425
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,160
oh god,
passion weekend thrown away.

426
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:11,440
This doesn't seem right.
That there is a detachment,

427
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:16,441
there is a lack of consciousness and I 
can see how sort of this is a personal,

428
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:17,554
it's a personal problem,
one level and I think we feel hugely 

429
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:20,720
disempowered.
You think,

430
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,140
oh,
I'll put that in the recycling.

431
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,333
I'll help.
maybe I shouldn't do some more 

432
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:26,254
composting,
but you will in the face of these 

433
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:29,650
forces,
it feels irrelevant.

434
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:30,484
The other thing that I'm learning,
it must've disjunct in terms of power 

435
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,240
and what a theme that is between the 
personal and the power.

436
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,680
The other thing I would get from what 
you just said,

437
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:41,320
jack,
is that when they talk about,

438
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,061
you know,
oh,

439
00:21:42,061 --> 00:21:42,894
we'll just,
you know,

440
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,390
colonize the moon or whatever it is this
week.

441
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,173
It makes me realize how detached the 
powerful or from the lives of ordinary 

442
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,303
people,
because you mentioned a moment ago that 

443
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:59,260
the combustible revolutionary engine 
will be a a middle class,

444
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:01,930
which like a lot of people feeling like 
that.

445
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:02,764
The privilege that they're entitled to,
the resources and comfort they're 

446
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:08,470
entitled to is being eroded and then a 
giant on the class.

447
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:13,471
Now that on the class is as long ago,
been nominated as disposable wherever it

448
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:17,260
was in colonization,
slavery onwards,

449
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:18,094
perhaps even earlier than that,
that there's a huge percentage of the 

450
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:22,430
population that we simply,
we do not care.

451
00:22:22,431 --> 00:22:24,430
You are,
you are already machines.

452
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:26,170
And when we get better machines to 
replace you,

453
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,193
you know,
if we can find a nice way of framing 

454
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:30,004
genocide.

455
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:31,680
No,
that's,

456
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,513
you know,
the,

457
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,920
there's a brilliant,
um,

458
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,153
Paul Mason does a brilliant thing called
the car wash paradox and it's basically 

459
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,670
what was,
what was the car wash?

460
00:22:41,671 --> 00:22:42,504
The car wash in the 19 fifties was this 
amazing shining new piece of technology 

461
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,830
right here.
It was,

462
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:50,340
it was going to automate fluffy buds 
would come out and clean your car and it

463
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:53,070
will all look amazing.
What's happened in the last five years,

464
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,600
car wash,
the last 10 years,

465
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:55,434
car washes,
I started closing down right there in 

466
00:22:58,081 --> 00:22:58,914
prime locations in the centers of cities
which can then be turned into luxury 

467
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:03,354
flats.
All these automated machines have 

468
00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:07,770
disappeared.
And what has replaced them?

469
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,443
We're dead spaces on the outskirts of 
town where you have immigrant labor or 

470
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,020
cheap labor doing the job that machines 
would they.

471
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,820
So you know,
one option,

472
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,683
you know,
the machines had been made redundant by 

473
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:21,630
human beings.

474
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,510
The difference being that human beings 
have absolutely no rights.

475
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,950
They can be sat there and then and the 
and the whole thing can be taken down in

476
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:29,880
24 hours.
Right?

477
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,370
So that is one future that we might 
have.

478
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,110
The machines might not replace every 
one.

479
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:37,500
What might have is we might have this 
incredible moment and what we see on the

480
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:38,334
news nightly as we say,
full employment employment's never been 

481
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:43,950
higher and yet they say also wages are 
stagnating.

482
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,053
How can this,
how these two things correlate the same 

483
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:48,314
time?
Well would mean increase in part time 

484
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:53,420
work because of gig economy because 
people,

485
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,620
what you'll have is you'll have the 
people at working for like delivery,

486
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,760
uber,
you know,

487
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,510
so basically with no know were very 
limited rights such as we decided,

488
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:02,840
yeah,

489
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,790
it's a reversal of all of the things 
that were fought for in the last name

490
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,330
tree.
But with no one working for any money so

491
00:24:10,331 --> 00:24:12,700
that he knows that the other future that
we might have these,

492
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,583
these are,
these are very radical changes to the 

493
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:21,030
structure of society and society that 
kind of,

494
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,460
you know,
maybe we're doing is going back to.

495
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,550
We had to,
we had a period of stability from 1940,

496
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,340
roughly two,
19 the end of the nineties.

497
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,250
So what we're doing is going back to 
that previous period,

498
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:35,040
a period of huge human instability,
you know,

499
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,770
we call that that class the precariat,
you know,

500
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,460
we're all part of the precariat brick 
area instead of.

501
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,810
Yeah.
Instead of being a prototype area,

502
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,230
it's beyond that.
It's the ultimate precarious class.

503
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:47,370
The global class.

504
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,923
One of the themes that I've noticed over
the course of these podcasts is the way 

505
00:24:51,481 --> 00:24:55,380
that power functions is to,
as best as possible,

506
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:00,410
more to facilitate its ongoing survival.
Eg one slavery gets banned.

507
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:02,281
It's like,
oh,

508
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:03,114
what is the best?
It was the closest we can approximate 

509
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:07,260
slavery without using that word.
Well,

510
00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:08,094
you could pay people next to nothing.
And when you give a sort of like that 

511
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:11,034
car wash example is like that.
And what concerns me when you use the 

512
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:18,690
silicone valley tech entrepreneur,
new sovereignty of these great,

513
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:20,850
powerful corporations that now dominate 
the globe,

514
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,640
is that in this sort of,
in their utopia,

515
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,773
the,
the problems of ordinary people are 

516
00:25:27,331 --> 00:25:28,164
irrelevant.
It doesn't mAtter that there is this 

517
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,960
gray in more first underclass almost not
matter anymore.

518
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:37,640
Now almost a missed that are just 
holding up reality.

519
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,513
Yeah.
You have a kind of so much state of 

520
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:42,800
bliss which is kind of created by,
you know,

521
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,840
a mixture of,
you know,

522
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,350
pharmaceutical,
you know,

523
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,213
what you have is you have,
you have a mental health crisis in 

524
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:50,454
britain,
you have an unprecedented level of 

525
00:25:51,871 --> 00:25:52,860
prescription drugs.
You know,

526
00:25:52,861 --> 00:25:55,350
I interviewed A gp in blackpool,
which is the,

527
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,493
you know,
which is the depression capital of 

528
00:25:57,421 --> 00:25:58,680
britain.
And I sort of said,

529
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,660
you know,
what,

530
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,120
what did pharmaceutical drugs do here?
What do antidepressants do?

531
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,180
And she said,
well,

532
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,600
you could argue that they enable 
poverty,

533
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,010
you know,
what do they do,

534
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:09,210
what do they do?
I said,

535
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:10,860
you know,
do they enable poverty?

536
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,560
And she said,
that's such a complex question,

537
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:17,790
but it could be,
it could be the case that,

538
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,650
you know,
essentially what are we doing?

539
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,513
Are we medicating people where they Can 
endure otherwise unbearable conditions 

540
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,120
and what is the consequence,
you know,

541
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:27,954
what,
what are the social and economic 

542
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:29,910
consequences of that?

543
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,983
What are the consequences of obesity,
which has its correlation with 

544
00:26:34,831 --> 00:26:37,010
socioeconomic background,
you know,

545
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,140
what is the correlation with the 
creation of cheap,

546
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,540
what we call disparaging a cheap white 
goods,

547
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:47,550
the crash and the price of technology so
that people are aBsolutely addicted,

548
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:50,110
stuck to technology.
You know,

549
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,810
when essentially,
you know,

550
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,850
25 years ago that technology was even 
beyond the,

551
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,470
beyond their economic bracket,
they weren't able to afford that stuff.

552
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,543
Now this is kind of these big questions 
that I'm not saying I have the answers 

553
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:03,114
to,
but these are the kinds of macro issues 

554
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:08,850
that we should be tackling and not,
not kind of separating off,

555
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,713
you know,
fats over here and it's unconnected to 

556
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:15,090
pop in.
Technology is unconnected to aspiration.

557
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,600
Everything is connected and you have to 
understand that he's connected.

558
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,400
There's a mental health crisis,
but the mental health crisis is excel.

559
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,420
If a result of these,
of this economic paradigm,

560
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,513
that's incredible,
so it's creating people that for whom 

561
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:32,700
life is unbearable and instead of going,
oh,

562
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:36,740
should we look at this economic model?
simply drug the people that

563
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:42,430
swing mental health and your and your 
and your income.

564
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,563
I mean blackpool is the is one of the 
most depressed cities in britain also 

565
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,003
has some the.
There's a direct correlation between 

566
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:51,520
obesity and britain being the most 
overworked,

567
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:53,800
underpaid country.
I mean those two things are not,

568
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,630
not an accident,

569
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,463
but even beyond the income jack is that 
the quality of life that people are 

570
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:04,401
living is if you are meaningless and 
your life is meaningless and you have no

571
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:05,394
value and you have no purpose and your 
role in society is simply to consume 

572
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,893
knowing that you consumed,
you are what you eat and what you eat a 

573
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:13,314
disposable products and you are a 
disposable product that that's getting 

574
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:19,200
juice.
A huge existential crisis.

575
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,100
I see.
I have the image of like,

576
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,943
you know,
when you're dealing with a lawyer and 

577
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:27,390
like all the evidence points to live 
like in a minute,

578
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:29,370
it's causing a mental health crisis that
were just drug them.

579
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,200
It's causing an ecological crisis.
Don't worry,

580
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:32,310
we'll go to the moon.
It's like,

581
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,590
well,
why don't you deal with the actual thing

582
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:35,424
of what you can't run life because a 
profit making machine because it's a 

583
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:38,760
struggle.

584
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,850
I think I see dead dead right,
and I think there's a strong.

585
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,713
I think the struggle that people don't 
realize they see capitalism as this 

586
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,320
monolithic evil.
They don't.

587
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:46,831
They think,
oh,

588
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:48,720
there's these companies are trying to 
screw everyone over.

589
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,823
Actually,
the reality is the real struggle now is 

590
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:51,924
not between workers and bosses.
It's between ceos of companies who 

591
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:58,230
genuinely want to bring about change.
There's poor.

592
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,340
There's a guy who runs unilever and he 
said,

593
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:02,941
well,
I said,

594
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,340
what's your greatest achievement?
He says,

595
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,020
to get rid of the hedge fund managers to
get rid of short money,

596
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,780
short term profit motive within this 
company.

597
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,420
We have to do something about global 
warming.

598
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,433
When you speak to them,
they talked like they are occupied or 

599
00:29:15,301 --> 00:29:16,134
something.
They don't feel like they're the ceo of 

600
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:19,074
a global corporation.
You know the and and the reason why is 

601
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:24,090
because they know that government can't 
do paris,

602
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,103
paris climate changes of failure.
Government can't do this stuff and it's 

603
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:30,120
almost like they think no one else can 
do it.

604
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:30,954
We've got the power we have to do so.
The struggle of the future will be 

605
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,123
business versus business.
It'll be the business visions of people 

606
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:39,324
like mark zuckerberg who basically said 
essentially in that facebook thing that 

607
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:43,594
he put up,
I am going to stand for president 

608
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,360
because now he's seen that trump can do 
his version versus trump's version.

609
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,363
That's what you'll have.
You'll have competing business visions 

610
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:52,954
of what the future should.

611
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,440
Except all of these people without human
beings are nothing.

612
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,330
The results,
these ordinary people,

613
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,283
unless someone can bypass that lets 
people say that the reason that you're 

614
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:03,643
engaged in this economic game is so that
other people can benefit and facilitate 

615
00:30:06,981 --> 00:30:10,520
and the only way to change it is to 
disengage from the economic gain and the

616
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:11,354
only way you're going to be able to do 
that is by finding and alternative to 

617
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,150
making yourself feel better unless.
And like for me,

618
00:30:17,151 --> 00:30:17,984
this is where religion becomes 
interesting because it's a model that 

619
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:23,940
exists outside economics.
It was co opted by economics early.

620
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,130
Yeah.

621
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:24,963
Was it a surprise that religion is 
fighting back when we look at religion 

622
00:30:27,151 --> 00:30:30,540
in various forms as being the last.
Basically there's no result,

623
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,270
isn't it?
It's no accident that Jihadism stands as

624
00:30:33,271 --> 00:30:34,680
a kind of,
almost as a,

625
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,470
as a sort of caliphate black flag 
alternative.

626
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,420
That doesn't have to be the onLy 
alternative.

627
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,100
But again,
rather like trump,

628
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,083
it's an inarticulated slightly 
incohesive difficult to comprehend 

629
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,760
version of an alternative

630
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,030
because fear,
like on an emotional level,

631
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,030
fear and desire of fact that they are 
irrational.

632
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,370
You where people are being kept in an 
irrational state,

633
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,300
uh,
uh,

634
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:57,134
to perpetuate.
Consuming so fear and desire is 

635
00:30:59,361 --> 00:31:00,920
basically what you're continually 
feeling.

636
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:03,200
These are irrational state.
So irrational,

637
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:04,940
alternative,
seem attractive.

638
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,961
I like,
you know,

639
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:08,250
I think that trump was just deserts.
If you,

640
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,233
if you feed people that information 
continually jingoism tell people that 

641
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:14,680
nothing has any meaning,
eventually you will get this mba,

642
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,573
brexit at the same thing.
I feel that the conditions were created 

643
00:31:17,991 --> 00:31:19,200
for it.
Now there are the,

644
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,140
there are alternate alternate 
narratives.

645
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:21,974
Even within this global context.
I'm very interested in the example of 

646
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:28,720
China because they exist outside of our 
story.

647
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,580
So can you tell us what this is?

648
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,000
China,
China,

649
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,010
China.
You have the kind of,

650
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,933
we know we're not talking about the 
different corporations and you have put 

651
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:36,030
in running China,
uh,

652
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,890
Russia plc,
you've got,

653
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,763
you know,
trump like kind of failing chrysler of 

654
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:42,180
the United States,
you know,

655
00:31:42,181 --> 00:31:44,400
like some mid,
mid seventies corporation.

656
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,550
Then if you look at China,
china's quietly getting on with it.

657
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:48,384
And the interesting thing is they'd 
squared the circle of democracy and you 

658
00:31:52,231 --> 00:31:52,981
know,
growth.

659
00:31:52,981 --> 00:31:53,790
They've,
you know,

660
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,290
when you go to davos,
what you hear,

661
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:56,124
you know,
which is the meeting of the heads of 

662
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:59,640
government,
every uBi annual meeting in Switzerland.

663
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,400
The endless debate is how does democracy
get in the way you know?

664
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,423
is democracy compatible with the future?
You know as though democracy is in 

665
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:09,924
crisis,
there's endless discussion about 

666
00:32:10,771 --> 00:32:14,310
democracy being in crisis in China.
What happened in China,

667
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,240
they basically state tiananmen square 
was the,

668
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,443
was a,
was a watershed because at that moment 

669
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,493
it appeared as if democracy was going to
have to be the thing that the ruling 

670
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:31,050
party gave away to the middle class.

671
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,210
No,
you don't need to do that.

672
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,260
What you need to do is you need to sell 
them consumer goods.

673
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,040
You need to move them into being an 
aspirant.

674
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,980
We're middle class,
like a western middle class.

675
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,933
You can buy off any demands for 
democracy and so China squared that 

676
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:48,074
circle,
how do we make consumer goods available 

677
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,003
in China?
Used to be the workshop of the west so 

678
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:55,250
you know you'd always have light light.
When I was a kid,

679
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:58,070
I have my made in China,
made in China.

680
00:32:58,071 --> 00:32:58,904
On the thing no longer now made it now,
now it's china's turn to be like the 

681
00:33:02,391 --> 00:33:04,610
west was and to become this,
you know,

682
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,533
the largest market in the world and 
essentially we produce or africa or 

683
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,521
wherever,
India,

684
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:11,354
whoever decides to be come the workshop 
for China produces cheap goods for 

685
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:18,410
China.
China is the country that the planet now

686
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:19,244
pivots on.

687
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,070
China basically bailed out the United 
States after the,

688
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,700
after the subprime crash.
So you know,

689
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,200
it's basically like a giant hsbc loan,
you know,

690
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,040
China is the bank and that's really 
loud.

691
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,490
Yeah.
After that crash,

692
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,100
trying twice,
twice,

693
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,973
China is bailed out the us.
So that means America is in debt to 

694
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:41,030
China when you're talking about these 
secret deals that govern the world.

695
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,953
So that is,
that is happening on a net that is 

696
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,550
happening at the level of suffering or 
at least national states.

697
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:47,384
Right.
That's not always easy because because 

698
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:51,530
what you've got is you've got China are 
operating like a,

699
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,423
like a corporation.
So it's like your operation with a 

700
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:55,124
board.
Yeah,

701
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,440
like a highly successful corporation.
But you know,

702
00:33:57,441 --> 00:34:00,920
what's interesting is the chinese,
they have this last,

703
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,720
actually this year,
they launched obo,

704
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:08,510
which is their grand plan for the future
of the planet from bloody terrifying one

705
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:09,440
belt,
one road.

706
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,273
It's the recreation of the silk road,
which was basically trade route to the 

707
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:14,924
wet,
the trade route that connects the 

708
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:18,410
planet,
globalized the planet.

709
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,490
What they see is they see China creating
a new silk road,

710
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,410
but they're in charge.
They also see the unprecedented need for

711
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,990
a power in terms of,
you know,

712
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,960
the pollutant aspects of what's going to
happen with growth.

713
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,480
They see that being dealt with by not by
an unprecedented rise in,

714
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,030
in investment in global,
uh,

715
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:39,740
in,
in,

716
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,810
in solar and wind power.
And so they also,

717
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:47,870
there's sort of a weird combination of 
ultra frightening and ultra optimistic.

718
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,093
It's like you don't know which way,
you don't know which way they're going 

719
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:52,700
to go and you don't quite know how to 
read it.

720
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:54,740
It's kind of a combo of the two.
I have two questions.

721
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,080
One is how did they avoid them?

722
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,100
Ocracy Just fruit consumers.
And what did they do?

723
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,250
Just basically the end,
you know,

724
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,103
tiananmen square marked was,
it was a cataLyst in terms of our men 

725
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,880
who was a major,
major plans on the street.

726
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:09,560
The man would have shopping bags in 
front of a tank,

727
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:11,130
will never forget that guy.
Yeah,

728
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,990
but how did that,
like I said,

729
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:13,824
that people were demanding,
we want to be invite engaged in power 

730
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,450
and spite.
Instead it was like,

731
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:17,691
no,
no,

732
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:18,524
no,
you can have,

733
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,870
but how do you actually do.
What does that actually mean?

734
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,580
I think because how do you do is you 
create,

735
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:23,770
I mean,
in a way the,

736
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,440
the,
you know,

737
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:29,440
China has a very deep seated with a very
deep rooted belief in the states,

738
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,633
in loyalty to the state,
the individual and the state being as 

739
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:36,250
one.
they come from this idea,

740
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:38,940
that doctrine of the mean,
which is an asian principle.

741
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,930
The,
you know,

742
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,870
essentially the,
any kind of dispute,

743
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,330
a dispute between you and I.
You're not right.

744
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:48,390
I'm not right.
But the solution lies in the middle,

745
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,420
in a place that neither you nor.
I have thoughts.

746
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,010
So it's a kind of,
it's the doctrine of the main is a,

747
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:53,850
is a kind of,
it's a,

748
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:58,110
it's a philosophy of how you deal with 
problems,

749
00:35:58,111 --> 00:35:58,944
how you deal with solutions.
We come from a kind of completely 

750
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,670
different.
We come from the enlightenment,

751
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:06,990
from the idea of a discourse,
me putting my argument,

752
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:09,840
you put in your argument either your 
right or I'm right,

753
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,910
so it's combatative,
you know,

754
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,450
which was the dialectic,
you know.

755
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,540
So we come from a completely different 
place.

756
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:18,060
So there's a sort of a spirit functional
thing.

757
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,903
It's a fun.
It's a fundamentally part of what it is 

758
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:23,010
to be chinese is this notion.

759
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,570
Yes.
And that would not have been,

760
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,200
that wouldn't have been underwritten by 
ideas of statehood initially.

761
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:30,780
That would havE been sort of self and 
otherness.

762
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,860
The original confusion.

763
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,223
Well the rice field being this really 
important thing to riceville being a 

764
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,290
sort of symbol of the state so that the 
grains of rice,

765
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:45,490
I like the citizens,
they all part of the greater good of the

766
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:50,260
state and that you understand that your 
places as part of the state.

767
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:51,980
Whereas we have,
we don't have,

768
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,833
don't have that notion for.
We have the notion that the hunter 

769
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:55,870
gatherer or the,
you know,

770
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,500
we haven't

771
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,450
ritualistic.
Yeah,

772
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:58,970
and individualistic sense.
Yeah.

773
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,233
So China has sort of philosophical roots
that are gonna help them prevail that 

774
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,753
because we,
because of our identity myths of 

775
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:15,070
individualism stitched into them.
So like how bay still pretty.

776
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,360
Presumably it's a stratified society.
China,

777
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,950
they've sort of diverted from any idea 
of sort of equality.

778
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,700
Yeah.
Well it's interesting isn't it?

779
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,100
Because you have,
you have already used,

780
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,870
you still have demands for rights,
you still have a middle class,

781
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:31,000
you still have,
you'll still.

782
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,490
The human beings will always demand what
human beings do bond.

783
00:37:34,491 --> 00:37:39,440
And so I think the situation for China,
and I'm not an expert on China,

784
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:40,670
but you know,
if you get one in,

785
00:37:40,671 --> 00:37:42,770
it'd be very interesting to hear what 
they have to say about this,

786
00:37:42,771 --> 00:37:46,610
but it seems to me that the future for 
China lies in there.

787
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,280
They're very cleverly avoiding the 
western route.

788
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,860
They don't wAnt to take the route that 
the United States to.

789
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,753
They don't want to be the country.
That became a super power and then went 

790
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:58,310
into decline.
And so,

791
00:37:59,090 --> 00:37:59,923
and I think part of that key to that is 
staying true to the philosophy and just 

792
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:05,570
this year,
uh,

793
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,680
you know,
you know,

794
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,190
jumping has basically become a,
the ultimate.

795
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,350
He's,
he's given himself the highest accolade,

796
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:13,490
you know,
he's the new now.

797
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,470
So he's absolutely total total power 
over the state.

798
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:19,340
He is the state

799
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,253
what he's trying his relationship with 
corporations then like they have the 

800
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,250
image that we have.
It's

801
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,083
fascinatinG.
It's really interesting because if you 

802
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:28,454
look at how western corporations bend 
themselves towards the chinese market 

803
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,133
because what they see is they see the 
biggest market on the world in the 

804
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:37,030
world.
And so how do we,

805
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,830
how do we go into that market,
you know,

806
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,100
apple,
google that you see that they have their

807
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:45,970
own versions of all the tech brands that
we already have.

808
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:46,804
So to some degree do they need to,
do they need to even have our tech 

809
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:51,610
brands,
they don't need to acres anymore.

810
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:56,830
Chinese have no sense of needing to 
eight the west anymore,

811
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:57,843
you know,
they're doing their own thing in gene 

812
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,183
in.
Um,

813
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,360
uh,
all the,

814
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:04,120
the gene editing that they're doing now,
the crispr benign stuff,

815
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:04,954
I don't know if you know about all that,
but it's basically they absolutely 

816
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:08,540
leading the world,
you know,

817
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,380
so it's that,
that's,

818
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,030
there's no sense in which I think we 
patronizingly looked at China was like,

819
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,100
you know,
how is it going to develop,

820
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:19,730
how is it going to leap progress?
Well,

821
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:20,564
it's just going to,
they just think about the world in a 

822
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:22,900
different way from us.

823
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,810
I say it's not a,
a narrative that exists as a comparative

824
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,110
except from our perspective.
They have their own original,

825
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,003
the ideology that is distinct and 
separate and now I'm no longer needs to 

826
00:39:35,821 --> 00:39:39,600
see itself in daily active discourse 
with our western narrative.

827
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,583
And in fact,
according to their own natures and your 

828
00:39:42,301 --> 00:39:43,134
motif,
they have a self contained ideology 

829
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,553
where the individual and the state can 
have a harmonious relationship and this 

830
00:39:49,461 --> 00:39:51,870
is going to be hugely beneficial for 
them going forward.

831
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,430
And the thing that you said a moment ago
about,

832
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:56,264
uh,
the combustible force of a growing 

833
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:58,314
underclass and dissatisfied middleclass.
I'm very interested in gaging and 

834
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:04,314
understanding these forces.
One thing that is interesting to me is 

835
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:09,174
with the diesel,
with this sort of a sort of recent 

836
00:40:11,581 --> 00:40:12,414
attempt to reengage national identity,
that would be the examples we've 

837
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:16,531
mentioned,
trump,

838
00:40:16,531 --> 00:40:17,364
brexit,
it's stuff that's happening throughout 

839
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:22,320
europe and it's a aids I'm distilling to
fail.

840
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,183
These ideas.
People marching in charlottesville 

841
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:24,994
aren't going to get what they want.
People that will want to reimpose a 

842
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:30,240
national identity,
they're not going to get what they want.

843
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,223
The sort of source satisfaction and pain
will continue and many of the examples 

844
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:37,980
that you've given across this show of 
like health crisis,

845
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,873
agricultural crisis,
they all point to the power of these 

846
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:41,874
transnational corporations.
Now when people are saying what we want 

847
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,173
is to condemn migrants,
they are simply another symptom of the 

848
00:40:50,221 --> 00:40:51,054
problem that you have diagnosed.
How do you think we can engage the 

849
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:01,100
energy of the basically everybody in the
world.

850
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,990
How do you direct that?
How do you tell this story?

851
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:05,340
How?
What have you learned?

852
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,240
You know,
It's all.

853
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,083
I make these series and I try to analyze
and as objective as possible how things 

854
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:14,600
work,
you know,

855
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:15,443
how the world works and what people say 
to me every single time is what are the 

856
00:41:20,551 --> 00:41:23,160
solutions,
what's your solution to this,

857
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,263
what do we do?
And in a way that is enough that people 

858
00:41:26,941 --> 00:41:27,774
ask that question because we're at a 
moment where we can't talk about 

859
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,364
revolution in the 20th century way.
We can't talk about people going to the 

860
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:37,754
barricades and deciding that they're 
going to take over the post office or 

861
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:43,260
something that isn't going to happen.

862
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,550
We're going,
we're going to a space where,

863
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:50,031
you know,
it's,

864
00:41:50,031 --> 00:41:50,864
it's,
it's that thing that you mentioned 

865
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:54,740
earlier about the supermicro and the 
super macro.

866
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,783
It's kind of,
we laugh when we put stuff in our 

867
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:58,550
recycling bin,
but you know,

868
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:01,910
I went to detroit and went to camden,
New Jersey,

869
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:05,810
which is the most poverty stricken 
system was crime ridden city in America.

870
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,900
People are moving there because it's 
super cheap.

871
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,830
It's like basically you've got people 
starting up businesses like you know,

872
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:14,330
and you just think,
you know,

873
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,164
there's kind of something.
They're growing vegetables in their 

874
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,503
front door.
There's something kind of laughable and 

875
00:42:20,211 --> 00:42:21,044
laudable and brilliant at the same time 
about people just doing stuff for 

876
00:42:24,861 --> 00:42:25,694
themselves.
It's almost a kind of millennial 

877
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,743
generational sort of reaction to this 
idea that you've got to be on twitter 

878
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:35,180
and facebook and whatever it is 
endlessly,

879
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:38,000
you know,
it's a kind of almost like a progressive

880
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:38,520
luddite.

881
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,650
Autism or something,
you know?

882
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:40,700
Do you see what I mean?
You know,

883
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:42,650
the kind of techno prairie,
someone said,

884
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:43,970
oh,
you were on the techno prairie.

885
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:46,400
We're all got wifi,
but I'm growing carrots.

886
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:47,450
You know,
it's kind of like,

887
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:50,000
I think that's,
I think there's going to be 50 different

888
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:54,980
strains of rebellion against the system.
Whatever the hell the system is,

889
00:42:54,981 --> 00:42:57,530
you know,
and I think it'll take the form of those

890
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:00,620
guys who have just bought one inch of 
the trump wall.

891
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:01,454
You know,
today they've decided to buy a meter of 

892
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:04,904
the ground where trump plans to build a 
wall across Mexico and they've said 

893
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:10,460
we're going to make it legally 
impossible for him to do.

894
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:14,300
So that is a clever lateral way of 
rebelling.

895
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:18,170
And I think that that's what human 
beings are doing all the time.

896
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,100
You know,
I try to buy south the a kind of present

897
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:22,310
way.

898
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,200
I try to basically the,
the,

899
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,493
the franchise was up for southeastern 
railways was most failing british 

900
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:31,100
railway and the commuters have a 
miserable time.

901
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,173
I said to the bbc and the communities,
why don't we try and run the railway 

902
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:37,610
ourselves?
Why don't we bid for the franchise?

903
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,450
We put together a bit just from all the 
people who are on the train.

904
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:46,270
You had expertise on the train of like 
you had nurses,

905
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,530
care workers,
accountants,

906
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,573
every conceivable a hedge fund managers,
every conceivable person brought 

907
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:55,640
together for the purposes of a common 
good.

908
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,750
And the department of transport turned 
it down just simply because we weren't.

909
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,990
They said we hadn't gone through the 
right hoops,

910
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:03,824
but essentially we put together a 
credible plan which was then taken on 

911
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:09,950
board by them.
And you think that's kind of the future.

912
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:12,050
Thinking laterally,
thinking differently,

913
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:12,884
connecting with people in unexpected 
ways and who the hell knows what will 

914
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:17,384
happen?

915
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,273
Revolution,
I suppose is taking your power back is 

916
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,420
saying,
I'm going to have my power.

917
00:44:22,421 --> 00:44:23,254
I'm not going to defer it.
I'm not going to subscribe to other 

918
00:44:25,061 --> 00:44:25,894
peoples ideas and systems and whether it
is a growing vegetables on a tech now 

919
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,213
prairie or to participate economically.
It's this sense that you have authority 

920
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:36,954
and authorship of your own life.
Something you said earlier about the 

921
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:39,984
cic.
I was themselves sort of wanting to 

922
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:42,714
resolve these problems I find quite 
inspiring because all of these systems 

923
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:46,464
and ideas are built upon people and are 
resourced by people and require people 

924
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:52,890
in order to pop to perpetuate 
themselves.

925
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,800
And what that makes me think,
jack is that the.

926
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,760
If you can buy what people are trying to
do,

927
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,970
like the ass end of this neck in 
antidepressants,

928
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,863
in blackpool and in bad salty,
sugary food and buying crap disposable 

929
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:09,720
goods.
They trying to feel good.

930
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,603
They're trying to feel happy and the 
system that they are trying to process 

931
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,010
these feelings through to no longer 
provide for them.

932
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,410
So I,
I feel that what you said,

933
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:20,330
like the weather,
you know,

934
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,550
there'll be 50 different ways that the 
important,

935
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,630
the,
the how is not important.

936
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:26,790
The thing that's important is that you 
just start to,

937
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:27,624
that you started,

938
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,260
you know,
it's a very middle class.

939
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:31,094
I hate people in a way who are engaged 
in politics because to me it's quite a 

940
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:37,250
bourgeois kind of.
It's quite an,

941
00:45:37,251 --> 00:45:41,000
it's quite an interesting thing that we 
even think we have the luxury of sitting

942
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:42,800
here.
Like we are discussing these things.

943
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:43,843
Most people are just trying to survive 
and you buy a bag of chips after having 

944
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:47,834
done a 16 hour shift.
You don't give a toss about global 

945
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,064
economics or corporations and sewing,
but you want one thing you want is what 

946
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:57,350
you said is you want your life to be 
better.

947
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,830
And it sorts of,
that's why you know,

948
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,813
changing your life and doing it at the 
micro level is kind of revolutionary 

949
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,100
because that's what matters to people.
That's actually what matters.

950
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:09,640
It seems abstract because in some 
senses,

951
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:10,940
you know,
we live in infinite space,

952
00:46:10,941 --> 00:46:13,070
but we also live in camden,
New Jersey.

953
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:17,680
The idea of infinite space or the globe 
is all be abstract.

954
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:20,210
It's nice that we know it,
but the fact is we live in ourself.

955
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:23,740
We live in our community and we need to 
have different relationships at that.

956
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,400
That's really community.
You see,

957
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:25,731
when,
uh,

958
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:26,564
when I was in the agenda,
the reason I had this sort of slightly 

959
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:31,970
without sounding too weird,
I had to kind of epiphany moment where I

960
00:46:31,971 --> 00:46:32,804
was sort of in the street and you've got
like drug dealers cavorting around on 

961
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,730
like chilled children's bikes and 
things.

962
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:39,770
It's just sofas in the middle of the 
road.

963
00:46:39,771 --> 00:46:40,950
It's just like the,
you know,

964
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:41,803
it's like a joke.
It's like the wire but for real and 

965
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:46,550
you're sort of there.
And there was this guy and he was like,

966
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,940
he was busking and he was like on a 
street corner and I had a lollipop.

967
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:50,953
It had broken up guitar,
which he put put tape on and he was 

968
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,140
using the lollipop as a plectrum and I 
thought,

969
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,273
no one's gonna.
No one's gonna give you like an 

970
00:46:59,811 --> 00:47:00,644
entrepreneur.
No one's going to give you money like 

971
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,160
the most depressed place in the world.

972
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:06,500
He was giving it a go.
Do you know what I mean?

973
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:07,970
He was like giving a gun.
I thought,

974
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,050
my god,
it's like you walk down a street,

975
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:14,240
any street in britain or anywhere in the
world and you see 50 businesses,

976
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:15,074
some of which will fail,
some of which are and it's like all of 

977
00:47:17,121 --> 00:47:17,954
them.
Somebody had some crazy idea to start a 

978
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:20,474
business and they've had a go and you 
think there's something sort of 

979
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,080
inspiring.
I think about the idea of people.

980
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,390
Then utilizing that spirit,
that human spirits to survive,

981
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,890
but then doing something together and 
everyone who was in new in camden in New

982
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:36,723
Jersey said to me,
the reason we moved here is because of 

983
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,550
community.
They said,

984
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,740
we feel connected to the other 
businesses.

985
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:45,010
We are all together trying to make the 
community work.

986
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,410
We're employing local people employed.
I spoke to the guy,

987
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:51,340
worked and worked and he said I would 
100 percent be dead.

988
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,680
He was drug dealer,
drug dealer for 20 years.

989
00:47:53,681 --> 00:47:55,330
He ended up getting a job for the first 
time,

990
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,010
this place.
He said,

991
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:59,500
I would 100 percent be debt if these 
2:19

992
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,520
year olds haven't come here and started 
this print works and you think,

993
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:04,990
and he and they and they were only 
hiring people from,

994
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:05,853
from,
from that side,

995
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,560
maybe rebuilding community.
What do we have in britain?

996
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:10,060
We have isolated,
isolated,

997
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,040
atomize people who don't know their 
neighbors,

998
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:12,874
don't know anyone,
old people who live in solitary lives 

999
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:15,844
and unconnected to anyone.
Building community is really at the 

1000
00:48:18,071 --> 00:48:19,150
heart of what could happen.

1001
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:24,360
We unthinkingly submit our ingenuity to 
a preexisting system that has I hot,

1002
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,960
not as you said earlier,
as a machiavellian intent,

1003
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,170
but just as it's a.
I'm thinking emma,

1004
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,513
our subjugation it.
So immediately you say our business is 

1005
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:37,463
gonna make money in order to.
And the other problem built in is that 

1006
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,520
we still try to use sort of state 
solutions.

1007
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:43,354
Well,
the state will prevent transnational 

1008
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:45,071
corporate.
Well,

1009
00:48:45,071 --> 00:48:47,500
we now know that can't happen except in 
China,

1010
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:50,710
but it has an entirely different 
anthropological origin.

1011
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:53,820
So it seems to me that what a lot,
because I.

1012
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:54,903
This is the bloody thing that's all for 
that that prevents me from being simply 

1013
00:48:57,941 --> 00:49:02,941
a narcissist is the I deeply deeply care
that people are suffering in this way,

1014
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,480
is something about it makes me very 
unhappy and furiously angry.

1015
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,700
I kind of believe it's possible for it 
to change that.

1016
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:12,520
Yeah,
you must do is you want to ask around,

1017
00:49:12,521 --> 00:49:13,390
make noise,
documentaries.

1018
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:14,224
Would you put yourself ruled out buddy 
grief when you could be shopping the 

1019
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:21,430
misses and your mother In law,
but this is.

1020
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:22,823
We all care,
but it's just that everyone cares 

1021
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:27,360
because we human beings aren't.
We see a woman who run coca cola said to

1022
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:27,870
me,
look,

1023
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:29,310
I'm.
She said to me,

1024
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:31,650
I am,
you know,

1025
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:36,120
it's accused the company of creating 
obesity and so on,

1026
00:49:36,121 --> 00:49:38,130
you know,
the high fructose corn syrup and all the

1027
00:49:38,131 --> 00:49:39,930
rest of it.
and she turned to me and she said,

1028
00:49:39,931 --> 00:49:40,920
yes,
we did all that.

1029
00:49:40,921 --> 00:49:41,754
We didn't know what we were going to do.
We didn't know that was going to be the 

1030
00:49:43,561 --> 00:49:45,060
end result.
And then she turned to me.

1031
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:46,590
She said,
I am a mother.

1032
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:48,263
And I thought that was an interesting 
thing to say because she was sort of 

1033
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:52,470
saying,
I am a human being.

1034
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,260
Please be reminded,
I am human,

1035
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:58,650
I understand the consequences of these 
decisions.

1036
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:02,040
And that is,
you kind of have to hope that that's,

1037
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,090
you know,
interesting,

1038
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:03,800
interesting.

1039
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,670
Like remind yourself this because like 
you know,

1040
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:07,690
a minute ago you said that thing about 
like,

1041
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,330
you know,
sort of,

1042
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:09,163
you know,
if you've found this 16 hour shift 

1043
00:50:10,411 --> 00:50:12,470
scaffolding or whatever,
you probably are going to just have some

1044
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:13,880
chips and not think about or listened 
to.

1045
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:14,714
The russell brand podcast they use is 
what you should be doing for him to 

1046
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:17,403
actually making it for you.
If you're a scaffold the police or 

1047
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,083
anything like that,
you don't feel connected to sort of 

1048
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:25,874
abstract ideological ideas.
But the reality is like your primary 

1049
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:30,644
identity,
it will be able to see a of coke or a 

1050
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:35,240
scaffold that is that I'm a father,
I'm a brother,

1051
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,070
I'm a mother,
I'm a sister,

1052
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:39,150
a daughter.
So like I don't like know.

1053
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,870
It's weird because we do these things 
were supposed to be talking about brexit

1054
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:42,704
or wherever.
And I think brexit don't impact my life 

1055
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:47,360
as much as some shit.
My daughter might have said this morning

1056
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,940
or my dog,
we humans,

1057
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:51,590
we're.
We live in human lives.

1058
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:52,424
These are ideological things.
As long as they're not impeding on our 

1059
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:56,660
lives,
they should be kept in the abstract.

1060
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:57,663
So.
And I think the only way to do that is 

1061
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:58,851
that,
gosh,

1062
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:02,930
this is may seem somewhat bloody 
reductive given who I'm talking to you,

1063
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:07,100
but it's to somehow replicate the 
communal unit.

1064
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:07,993
But we would tend to,
if unimpeded by post agricultural 

1065
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:16,510
ideological forms that benefit elites 
and inhabit and subjugate ordinary.

1066
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:20,660
That connotes really spot on in the 
sense often thing,

1067
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:21,494
and it's kind of really weird,
but I often think about the kind of 

1068
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:29,000
freud in emotional underpinning of 
capitalism.

1069
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:31,940
You know how everything is really 
emotion.

1070
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,290
They really,
even these,

1071
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:35,930
even like we're all sitting here,
gareth's not saying a word,

1072
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,000
you're sitting over up,
but there's a kind of like,

1073
00:51:38,001 --> 00:51:41,720
it's a sort of dance.
Everything is a kind of really nuanced,

1074
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:44,630
psychological dance.
I'm talking to you,

1075
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:46,250
you're talking to me.
We're kind of getting on.

1076
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:48,380
But he could have gone badly and it 
could have been,

1077
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:52,040
it could have like it could have rested 
on one thing you said or something.

1078
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:56,210
I did.
It's absolutely tiny tiny decisions that

1079
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:57,044
can have massive implications.
You think if you applied that to 

1080
00:51:59,631 --> 00:52:00,464
economics,
you applied that to the decisions that 

1081
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:06,230
corporations make whereby you appeal to 
the humanity of people.

1082
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,213
You deal with people on an emotional 
level and I've seen this actually does 

1083
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:11,264
have an effect.
We kind of overplay the hard money side 

1084
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:19,400
and we underplay the weird emotional 
psychological side

1085
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,373
because both of those things are 
resourced by the prime or the desire to 

1086
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,780
gain resources has a prime or engine.
Yeah.

1087
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,520
Like it's almost like I feel that 
philosophically is psychologically.

1088
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,960
It's like,
excuse me,

1089
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,360
that you want to navigate people to 
their,

1090
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,493
to their cradle and their deathbed 
continually like you were born once and 

1091
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:39,880
you were going to die.
Now that's,

1092
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,370
let's accept that basis and make 
decisions from there.

1093
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:43,323
Not continually in there,
but I'm the ceo and by wednesday we've 

1094
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:48,520
got a pie chart or whatever it is they 
have now.

1095
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:49,301
Is that like,
you know,

1096
00:52:49,301 --> 00:52:53,780
take these people that come up with 
these ludicrous maxims and ideas and all

1097
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:55,540
night,
so an opportunity that the,

1098
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:57,520
the,
the earth's only got 60 harvest in it.

1099
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:58,120
I go,
no,

1100
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:58,391
no,
no,

1101
00:52:58,391 --> 00:53:00,200
you're going to die.
You cannot,

1102
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,133
you know,
and that's why the reason that I am 

1103
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:06,880
interested in religion is not because of
the sort of a bizarre cultural artifacts

1104
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:07,723
of the cruise as a result of its time of
origin or the ludicrous prejudice that 

1105
00:53:11,461 --> 00:53:11,980
one flies.

1106
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,813
No,
but because it's dealing with the 

1107
00:53:13,811 --> 00:53:16,330
fundamental you're born,
you're going to die.

1108
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:17,223
You've experienced things that seem to 
be very similar from what other people 

1109
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:20,074
are experiencing.
Can we build systems on that basis and 

1110
00:53:22,481 --> 00:53:25,120
because I suppose there are sort of 
differences between.

1111
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:26,063
It seems that what we require our 
communities that are of a certain size 

1112
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,830
where the,
the individual members of that community

1113
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:35,180
have power within that community.
The other communities are earnouts to be

1114
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,033
run according to their own values.
And that the idea of that being on a 

1115
00:53:38,851 --> 00:53:43,050
national level these days is finished 
because it's too many people to do it.

1116
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:43,884
So.
And the state no longer has the 

1117
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:48,360
legitimacy of being the thing that 
defends us from the,

1118
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:50,250
I don't know,
the barbarians,

1119
00:53:50,251 --> 00:53:53,350
whether those are corporate barbarians 
or barbarians that are outside of our

1120
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,800
sovereignty hundred per se.
It's like aristotle.

1121
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:56,461
Lillian,
isn't it?

1122
00:53:56,461 --> 00:53:59,910
You're basically saying you're making an
argument for the greek polis,

1123
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,773
for the,
for the city state a state that 

1124
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,140
aristotle said hat to have a defined 
boundary in terms of its size,

1125
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,440
number of inhabitants,
for it to work economically.

1126
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:12,540
It could only work at this scale.
Any bigger.

1127
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,330
It becomes corrupted,
it becomes destroyed.

1128
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,590
You know?
It's kind of interesting,

1129
00:54:16,591 --> 00:54:18,030
isn't it?
How far have we come?

1130
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,213
That is the argument I'm making.
It might be a bit even smaller than 

1131
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:25,250
eight because of a chimps can only 
handle 75.

1132
00:54:25,251 --> 00:54:30,251
People say it's like an arab city.
Well,

1133
00:54:30,951 --> 00:54:33,110
under the skin is finally reached the 
conclusion.

1134
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:36,470
It's a city full of chimps scratching 
themselves,

1135
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,220
picking stuff out of each other's hair 
and doing things that chimps do.

1136
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:41,323
So your book a don,
the secret deals that are changing the 

1137
00:54:44,511 --> 00:54:47,140
world is out now.
It is noW.

1138
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:47,460
Now,

1139
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:47,961
apparently.
Yeah.

1140
00:54:47,961 --> 00:54:50,530
I knew the paperbacks are in february,
but it's out now.

1141
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,980
Get this book.
I'll be getting it and reading it.

1142
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:53,873
Don't feel mad and weird and conflicted 
that you're probably buying it from 

1143
00:54:56,581 --> 00:54:57,414
amazon.
Simply accepts that this is the way the 

1144
00:54:59,401 --> 00:55:00,234
world is now.
I say thank god for capitalism was what 

1145
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:03,984
would we be doing?
You'll be listening to this on your 

1146
00:55:06,031 --> 00:55:06,864
iphone.
You'll be buy my book and jack's book 

1147
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:14,280
from amazon and hopefully they figure 
just kind listlessly plugged in a carrot

1148
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,293
in your front garden that actually the 
seed was made by monsanto and it's 

1149
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:24,500
copyrighted.
You can't plan it there.

1150
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,760
Oh god.
Night.

1151
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:30,210
Now you're talking.
Keep stock at the right conversation.

1152
00:55:30,211 --> 00:55:33,830
Find a church that has an amazing.
Brilliant.

1153
