1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
One imagines that perhaps we have 
created through society for what is 

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:04,944
society butter pattern patterns that 
reward behaviors in patterns within us 

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,940
that are either negligent or detrimental
or toxic or psychopathic.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,253
Do you think of many of the people that 
are in positions of power and the 

5
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:21,540
structures that surround them and the 
structures that they perpetuate,

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,613
that these are the product of negative 
malevolent thinking and the kind of 

7
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:33,660
spiritual shift taking place on an 
individual level if significantly spread

8
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:34,494
could bring about the kind of change 
that's required and indeed would be 

9
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:38,430
called revolution.
Well,

10
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:39,080
so when I look at it,

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,913
people who are in power,
and it was interesting because I was 

12
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:43,634
listening to your podcast or Peterson 
and he and then he was kind of 

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,010
rationalizing the existence of 
hierarchies.

14
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,823
And,
but when I look at actually who forms 

15
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:55,700
the epics of the hierarchy in our 
society is largely traumatized people.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,100
Um,
for example,

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,640
if you believe you live in a horrible 
world,

18
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,280
how are you going to be?
You have to be aggressive,

19
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,740
grandiose,
paranoid,

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
a selfish.
In other words,

21
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:09,794
you'd be the president of the United 
States because he's the one who said in 

22
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:14,720
so many words that the world is a 
horrible place,

23
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,120
and that's the world he lives in.
The Buddha said,

24
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:18,200
2,500
years ago,

25
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,850
that was a miser,
create the world,

26
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,003
but my contention is that before the 
with our minds to create the world that 

27
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:25,564
will create some mines and trump's brain
was formed in a family where he was 

28
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:34,541
demeaned and punished and attacked and 
humiliated by his father.

29
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,810
And so he believes he lives in a 
horrible world.

30
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,860
That's what he acts out.
And his brother drank himself to death.

31
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,293
So is this traumatized people now his 
opponent I could go into that was also 

32
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:49,040
traumatized,

33
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,390
right?
So you're saying that in here,

34
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:54,720
Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump,
they were too traumatized people.

35
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,690
Doumergue fighting to govern a 
traumatized world.

36
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,410
That's exactly what I'm saying.
And,

37
00:01:59,411 --> 00:01:59,801
and,
and,

38
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:00,634
and,
and Hillary's drama showed up in when 

39
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:04,660
she had pneumonia,
she wouldn't even acknowledge it because

40
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:07,180
as a child she'd been taught.
She had to suck up her pain.

41
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:10,880
She mustn't be vulnerable.
She puts up with the philandering of her

42
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,930
husband who is as much of a,
uh,

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,100
uh,
explorative women is Donald Trump over,

44
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,040
was just not as egregious about it.
And then she's still justifies it.

45
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,803
And so she,
she,

46
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,690
her messages to become inauthentic and 
suck it all up.

47
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:26,800
And that's her form of trauma.

48
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,410
I can talk about British politics.
Cool.

49
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,380
I could talk about what did everyone.
Now you're on a roll.

50
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,700
I could talk about this repressed 
person,

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,633
uh,
who was so in denial of own trauma that 

52
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,500
she's willing to traumatize the most 
vulnerable people in society.

53
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,640
Her name was Margaret Thatcher.

54
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,650
What was head trauma?
Do you think this.

55
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,470
I'm enjoying this.
So you sort of,

56
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,890
a bit like in the Matrix when neo Nazis,
everything's made out a numbers.

57
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,950
You look at people and you see all their
trauma and damage.

58
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,880
See,

59
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,713
that's right.
I saw in her a tremendous oppressed 

60
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,310
person.
Um,

61
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:00,923
I saw then you have a bland faced 
schoolboy who's willing to murder 

62
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:10,690
hundreds of thousands of people and 
never taken any responsibility for it.

63
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,973
Uh,
and it still doesn't deal with the 

64
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,520
impact of it.
His name is Tony Blair,

65
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,420
who's quite willing to go to a bomb drop
son,

66
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,940
drop bombs on,
on,

67
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,580
on Arabs for away,
and they'll do it in,

68
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,091
in,
in,

69
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:24,924
in the service of lies that if schools 
could see through and these are 

70
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,020
traumatized people.
Otherwise they couldn't do it.

71
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:32,854
They wouldn't be that split.
And these are the people that our 

72
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:38,920
society rewards with power.
Well,

73
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:42,280
that's a sign of a traumatized society.
That's my next book.

74
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,860
It's good that asking to be a smash hit 
at one.

75
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,130
Banging to that already.
I got to write it first.

76
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,550
You've done the hot book will come up 
with a concept.

77
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,393
The restaurants itself.
Now what about the can we carry on with 

78
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,740
this game of.
I'm marking off the powerful because I'm

79
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:59,140
loving this.
So what can we say like,

80
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:02,110
uh,
like Barack Obama.

81
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,910
I'm like,
there is a continuum.

82
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,680
Obama.
Obama is a fascinating case going.

83
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,210
People talk about trump is destroying 
Obama.

84
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:12,100
His legacy.
I don't think so.

85
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,730
Trump is Obama's legacy.
Yes.

86
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,280
I read his biography.
He's a person that's very chameleon like

87
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,323
he can,
not deliberately and not even 

88
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:25,570
necessarily consciously a the identify 
with whoever,

89
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,120
so so,
so you can sound like a white man or you

90
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:30,460
can sound like a black man depending on 
where he's at.

91
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,070
So he appealed to both,
but I think his biggest,

92
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,983
his biggest sin was to have enrolled a 
lot of people in the possibility of 

93
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:42,640
transformation and change without 
delivering any of it.

94
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,150
For the moment.
Do you think that the inability of these

95
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:49,530
individuals to manifest real change is a
demonstration.

96
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,643
What we have are deeply entrenched and 
traumatized systems that are predicated 

97
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,073
on unconscious choices,
unconscious drives and that the system 

98
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:00,963
cannot,
will not alter itself from within 

99
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:04,414
itself,
but will sustain itself and it's only 

100
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:11,050
sort of new radical ideas that can alter
it well.

101
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,460
Any system is designed in such a way as 
to make change impossible.

102
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,100
That that's just the nature of any 
organization in the system so that.

103
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,930
So that.
So that doesn't matter what.

104
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,040
Even if Obama came along fully committed
to his agenda,

105
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,700
which I believe on some level he was 
sincere book.

106
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,083
That would have been a million reasons 
why the system and how the system would 

107
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:32,710
have prevented him from carrying an 
agenda,

108
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,150
but let me ask you something.

109
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,990
Were assert something.
Obama got into par,

110
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,020
funded heavily by Wall Street is a 
street stupid or do they or do they know

111
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,820
which side they're butter bread is 
buttered on.

112
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,683
They knew what they were getting.
They didn't buy into the whole pre 

113
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,873
changing kind of thing.
Then you exactly what a what a fast 

114
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:56,734
style and inefficient servant of the 
status quo he would be and those 

115
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:03,620
students is again to power.
Then your bills out Wall Street,

116
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,223
he was transferred.
He was responsible for one of the 

117
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:12,770
greatest transfers of wealth upwards in 
history and and and,

118
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,683
and,
and so the system you what they were 

119
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,990
getting.
It's just that the rest of us,

120
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,183
because we want to believe in the 
positive side of his persona because 

121
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:23,810
sucked in the system,
never got sucked in by him.

122
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:24,863
Why this but wielded clinging to these 
narratives that have clearly been 

123
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:31,360
exposed is erroneous.
Why now post trump do we.

124
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,253
Why are we seeing from the liberal 
establishment and a sort of a nostalgia 

125
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:36,694
for something that was basically about 
15 minutes ago rather than an 

126
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,820
acknowledgement and a recognition of the
need for meaningful,

127
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:47,500
significant change that addresses the 
problems of essentially the poor.

128
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,170
Well,
when you look at the,

129
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,043
um,
mean you look at see American politics 

130
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,770
or economics,
uh,

131
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,200
Obama was as ready as anybody to kill 
people abroad.

132
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,480
Um,
he was as,

133
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,710
as anybody to send troops overseas.
Um,

134
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,570
it's no different than American history 
has always been.

135
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,390
Um,
he was smoother about it.

136
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,750
He was more urbane about it.
He was a more articulate about it.

137
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,380
He also knew how to speak to people's 
better sides.

138
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,960
Along comes trump,
he's agregious.

139
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,640
He's a highly traumatized,
utterly self unrestrained,

140
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,313
a troubled schoolyard bully.
And so it's offensive to the 

141
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,663
sensitivity,
the sensibilities of the liberal 

142
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:46,560
establishment to have somebody like 
trump represent them.

143
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,500
Yes.
When it comes to genuine policy,

144
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,180
there's no difference between these 
people.

145
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:56,630
It's just that the system wants people 
who can make it more palatable and trump

146
00:07:58,351 --> 00:08:01,710
makes it very unpalatable.
And so trump has woken us up,

147
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,820
but it unfortunately,
a lot of the liberal outreach has been a

148
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,340
trump personally rather than at the 
policies,

149
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,720
and rather than at the system that he 
represents no bursts or no better,

150
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:14,970
in fact,
you've represented more worse than,

151
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,840
you know,
uh,

152
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,673
even a Bush or Clinton or Obama 
certainly can be much more effective in 

153
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,080
representing the system.

154
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,330
And trump is.
And that's what Thompson is.

155
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,253
Trump's son is not in what he does.
Trump's son is in his personal 

156
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:32,670
egregious.
I'm a in your face.

157
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,593
This function.

158
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,810
Is it that trump is not an anomaly.
Trump is revelation.

159
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,710
Trump reveal sales.

160
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,400
That's exactly what trump does.
And that's why they can't forgive him.

161
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,410
Yes.
Yeah,

162
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:46,100
absolutely.
That's right.

163
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,840
That's that personally I see it,
I think.

164
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,893
And by the end,
by the way I'm speaking of all of them 

165
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:53,840
are traumatized people.
I'm an Obama was abandoned by his father

166
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,340
and he idealize this father in his book,
songs my father or,

167
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,460
or,
or I forget what the title of it was.

168
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,100
Something quite sentimental songs but,
but,

169
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:05,611
but,
but,

170
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,090
but,
but,

171
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,923
but he was a traumatized person.
And then his mother was a high troubled 

172
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:11,670
individual and he was going to buy his 
white grandparents.

173
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,050
He,
this guy suffered,

174
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,520
but he's.
He lacquered is suffering with this.

175
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,120
But with this pattern of,
of rationality.
