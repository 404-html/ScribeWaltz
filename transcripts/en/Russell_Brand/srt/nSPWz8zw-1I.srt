1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,163
Tony,
how it is a professor of English at 

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:03,204
Warwick University and writes about 
performance in its social and political 

3
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:08,160
context.
His book,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,450
women as hamlet include studies of the 
shifting relationship of Shakespeare,

5
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:16,680
culture and gender in many societies an 
ideological situations.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,753
His work includes leading the 
multicultural Shakespeare project which 

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:24,750
focuses on the relationship between race
and Shakespeare in modern Britain and on

8
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:28,470
the achievement of black and Asian 
artists working on the place.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,540
Thanks for coming here,
Tony.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,450
Thank you.
We've worked together before,

11
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,284
of course on a a week at the national 
theater where we took various 

12
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:40,290
shakespeare monologues and I try to,
uh,

13
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,860
use them to tell a psychological and 
biographical story,

14
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:44,694
well,
specifically an autobiographical story 

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,050
using the works of Shakespeare to talk 
about my own life.

16
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:49,884
I was struck that in preparation for a,
for this week of rehearsal and 

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,283
workshopping,
you re-read Shakespeare in its entirety 

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,363
that's doing more work in preparation 
for that one event on Shakespeare than 

19
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:06,420
I'd ever done while I am paid to do that
sort of thing as a university professor.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,820
I see.
So it was no great hardship for you.

21
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:13,200
Did you discover anything on and that 
rereading of the works of Shakespeare?

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,600
Did you discover anything new?

23
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,743
What I did,
the reason why I did it was because I 

24
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:24,441
knew that you were making a project 
about Shakespeare and I'd been given the

25
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:28,680
headlines that you were interested in 
what Shakespeare might have to say about

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,860
parenting and about addiction.
And I instantly said,

27
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:34,831
oh,
well,

28
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:35,664
parenting,
that's perfect because Shakespeare in 

29
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:39,830
almost all of his plays,
um,

30
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,810
is showing you how not to be apparent.
Okay,

31
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,330
you can be a king,
a,

32
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,500
you could be a peasant,
whatever it is,

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,423
you will completely try to screw up your
child and you'll have huge success at 

34
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,110
that.
So that was no problem.

35
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,573
But addiction I found more difficult 
because it didn't instantly jump out to 

36
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:58,620
me that Shakespeare writes about that 
sort of thing.

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,933
Um,
which I sort of had a had conceived as 

38
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:06,210
being a drug addiction or addiction to 
tobacco or something like that.

39
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,203
And so I had to read through a whole lot
of texts and in order to try and find 

40
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:13,460
out where that connection might be,
um,

41
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,843
but there's nothing more enjoyable than 
planning through the complete works of 

42
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:18,060
Shakespeare.
So it was a great privilege

43
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,110
when you looked at addiction as 
analogist to obsession.

44
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,123
Ha.
That then surely it becomes completely 

45
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,060
different reading.

46
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,680
Yes.
Yup.

47
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,430
Because it took me some time to go to 
make that connection.

48
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,383
Um,
but there is a huge amount in 

49
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:40,220
shakespeare about obsession.
I mean,

50
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,293
um,
I hope you don't mind if I sort of 

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,770
pepper this conversation with references
to particular plays or performances,

52
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,690
difficult if we forbid it luminate 
people on Shakespeare,

53
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:51,524
Shakespeare relevant as to modern 
audiences and how Shakespeare reflects 

54
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,970
the relationships,
social,

55
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:58,190
cultural relationships as they evolve 
and develop.

56
00:02:58,191 --> 00:02:59,024
I mean,
what I'm fascinated by in particular is 

57
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,040
the way that you've studied how 
shakespeare relates to race,

58
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:03,874
how shakespeare relates to gender 
because it seems to me that you see the 

59
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:11,440
work of Shakespeare as some sort of uber
template for the human condition.

60
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,353
So that's what I'm interested.
So please don't mention the place and 

61
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,090
trying encourage to give you an 
obsession.

62
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,090
I'm thinking about Richard the third.
Okay.

63
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,340
Um,
there is a figure who is the kind of the

64
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,383
dark shadow inside all of us.
His only compulsion is to achieve power 

65
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,320
and to humiliate as many human beings in
the process as he can.

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,633
And,
and the way shakespeare kind of shows 

67
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:43,050
that is to give him at the start of the 
play.

68
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,410
I'm a pure wet through certain kinds of 
relationships.

69
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,853
So what he does is he comes up to a 
woman called lady whose husband he's 

70
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:59,841
murdered and he woos her over a coffee 
and at the beginning of that she is full

71
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,660
of anger and hatred.
By the end of it,

72
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,523
he's been successful in reducing her and
it's kind of showing off what willpower 

73
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,410
can actually achieve if it's totally 
focused.

74
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,143
So as a result of that,
we know that he is going to be very 

75
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:19,230
successful.
He's going to achieve anything.

76
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:22,920
He wants his damn but over a dozen 
bodies at least.

77
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,903
And in fact,
he then Shakespeare then shocks us by 

78
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:30,570
having him stamp over the bodies of 
children because we can all say,

79
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,404
okay,
well we're kind of empathize with the 

80
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,220
trickster,
the jester,

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,250
even the devilish character,
and we know that he's acting out sort of

82
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,100
terrible impulses,
which we feel,

83
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,950
and we get to kind of have,
uh,

84
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,190
an ejection of pleasure from feeling we 
can criticize it,

85
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,390
but we're also along there with him.
But when it comes to killing children,

86
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,430
which happens several times in 
Shakespeare,

87
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,300
it's wrenching your guts and you were 
forced to decide how far I'm going to go

88
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:00,564
along with this.
What's very interesting is that then we 

89
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:07,620
find out that obsession isn't just about
success.

90
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,990
It's about self entrapment and 
destruction.

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,540
So at the end of the play,
Richard,

92
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,374
the third,
who is now the king and has to replay 

93
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:17,490
that seduction scene.
He did.

94
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,533
There's another woman who is the queen 
of England and she's got a daughter who 

95
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:25,140
he wants to marry him.
So he has to go through the same thing.

96
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,540
He says the same words has the same 
reactions,

97
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,763
but this time he doesn't get the success
he wants so that I think that's an 

98
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:32,934
example of the way that human behavior 
is taken into areas that we don't 

99
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:42,510
normally experienced by Shakespeare,
but sooner or later will find that there

100
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:47,430
are limits and we're trapped by who we 
are and even if you set out to break all

101
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,264
the rules and to break every taboo to be
obscene and you're going to destroy 

102
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:56,850
yourself in the process and it will be a
very undramatic process.

103
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,843
It seems from listening to Tony that 
Shakespeare is necessarily dealing in 

104
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,800
archetypes and energies that are always 
present in human psyche.

105
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:10,964
I suppose that's an obvious point to 
make because otherwise Shakespeare 

106
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:17,840
wouldn't have been relevant at the time 
he was writing or relevant.

107
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:21,770
Now when you take,
just because it's come up,

108
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,663
a character like Richard,
the third who the archetype of the 

109
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:26,174
tyrant,
the sort of a damaged malcontent and 

110
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,340
that for me that seems like an emblem 
and a figure that is relevant now.

111
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:41,120
It seems like that this is a fractured 
and disrupted time.

112
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,350
Maybe.
It's always been like that.

113
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:44,240
Maybe that's an observation people 
continually make.

114
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,113
I'm referring of course specifically to 
a Donald Trump brexit times of 

115
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,690
malevolence severance and wrap chop.
Do you,

116
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,360
when you're relate into the contemporary
world,

117
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,190
use Shakespeare the same way that people
might look at a religious texts like the

118
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,110
Bible or Koran or whatever.
And my God,

119
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:11,060
these ideas are explored here because he
is talking about the totality of a human

120
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:15,260
being and all situations ultimately 
passed through the human psyche.

121
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:16,190
I'm a waiver.

122
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,843
Yeah,
exactly.

123
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,170
I mean,
that's,

124
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,650
that's what I think Shakespeare has 
become.

125
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,600
Um,
you know,

126
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,020
every country perhaps has a kind of 
cortext that's really important to it.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,833
Um,
and in many cases that will be a 

128
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:35,350
religious text or philosophical text or 
a political creed.

129
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:36,963
I think in many ways Shakespeare has 
become that for us and potentially for 

130
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:44,740
the English,
you may offer it all English people.

131
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
Um,
I mean for English culture at its best,

132
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,220
a shakespeare shows you how to live your
life,

133
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,150
which is that there is no dogma in 
Shakespeare.

134
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,830
Okay?
Um,

135
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,773
some of his plays,
which are the toilets with that for a 

136
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:01,054
second,
he's an evil man and he's overthrown at 

137
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:04,234
the end by the first of the Tudor on it 
and Shakespeare is writing Chou Dynasty 

138
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,350
so you can see it as propaganda.
Okay.

139
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,493
Um,
but actually the moment you start 

140
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,340
listening to the words that the new 
Judah kings speaks,

141
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,130
you begin to doubt it.
Um,

142
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,120
we're lucky I think to have such a 
phenomenal dramatic text at the heart of

143
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:33,211
our culture because that means that the 
writer is not imposing a perspective.

144
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,960
His job is to be as complete and diverse
as you possibly can.

145
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,913
I suppose because he's function is to 
tell a story rather than to impose an 

146
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:48,574
ideology.
But there is always a corollary between 

147
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:52,590
story

148
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,920
and character and between character 
essence.

149
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,340
I remember when we spoke before you said
that the Tempesta is in many ways the,

150
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:03,114
I don't know,
the denouement the completion of sort 

151
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:05,354
of,
and this is it the completion of 

152
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:08,900
Shakespeare.
So from,

153
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,923
from reading that text and from 
obviously familiarity with all this 

154
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,323
work,
would you maintain that there is not an 

155
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:18,354
ideology that there is not a dogma or I 
suppose there's a distinction between 

156
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:22,620
ideology and dogma?

157
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,163
Yeah,
that the temperature is great from that 

158
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:30,271
point of view because it shows you that 
we all have inbuilt compulsions,

159
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,940
one of which is that will to power.
Okay,

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,030
here's this wonderful magic island and 
we said this before,

161
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,030
the moment you set foot on that island,
you want to be.

162
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:42,280
It's key.
And as a result of that,

163
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,143
you're prepared to kill somebody to 
achieve control over that potential 

164
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:48,100
utopia.
Okay?

165
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,260
And so utopia,
which is in touch with magic,

166
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,050
which is very important because it's,
um,

167
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,043
it's a political place,
but also it's a spiritual place where 

168
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:58,630
anything is possible,
where the mind can be free.

169
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,050
But although we see that compulsion,
we see others as well,

170
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,530
we see that there's a parenting 
compulsion in that play.

171
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,420
There's a,
uh,

172
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,160
the,
the island is ruled by Prospero.

173
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:13,660
The magician who has

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,400
correct there.
Will you just tell me briefly the story,

175
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:17,234
because a,
I make a particular effort to make this 

176
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:23,330
podcast accessible to idiots.
I mainly do it by being one,

177
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,450
but I also do it by sometimes filling 
the gap.

178
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:27,340
So in,
uh,

179
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,423
in the tempest of which there's been a 
very good film version made a character 

180
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:36,400
of Prospero is a shipwrecked on an 
island find and you've taken it from me.

181
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,380
He used to be a duke.
Um,

182
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,760
he's an intellectual and so he's a poor 
government in Italy.

183
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,773
He's overthrown by his brother.
He's cast ashore and with his daughter 

184
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,713
and,
and,

185
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,930
and finds his way to this magic island 
where he rules the spirits through the,

186
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,900
in the,
the,

187
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,333
the,
the keys to magic and science that he's 

188
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:03,020
found in his books by a peculiar chance.
Um,

189
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,530
the,
uh,

190
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,690
political,
um,

191
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,800
family,
uh,

192
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,940
enemies that he has find themselves cast
on his island too.

193
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,770
He conjures up a,
uh,

194
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,020
a storm,
um,

195
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,680
to shipwreck them.
And then it's all about how,

196
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,750
how committed to revenge he is going to 
be [inaudible],

197
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,560
but in the process he also wants to 
marry his daughter off.

198
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,830
So there's a whole load of political 
kind of stories running through it,

199
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,040
but by stripping it down to a few 
isolated people on an isolated island in

200
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:39,100
a magical see,
it becomes archetypes.

201
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,340
I think it was very deliberate because 
there's is a.

202
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,710
There is a fusion of them.
There are characters that are magical,

203
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,770
like Ariel,
there's Kaliban who sort of odd,

204
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,890
some sort of a living piece of soil and 
the native priests of

205
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,650
colonialism as we would understand.
It really is that.

206
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,850
Isn't that right to say leave the 
colonialism for a second.

207
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,733
I'm taking those two characters.
There's this area who is a spirit and 

208
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:09,730
there's Kaliban who is a former slave.
It says in the stage directions,

209
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,900
but they show you how complex 
Shakespeare understands these archetypes

210
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:21,640
are because the beast is part of the 
human.

211
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:27,030
The angelic is part of the human too,
and these pressures and impulses.

212
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:28,924
They're at war with each other.
And so getting back to your original 

213
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:32,524
point,
which was about power and the tempest 

214
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,983
and the dogma that were finally given is
you may have the greatest spirituality 

215
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,083
in the world.
You may have the strongest access to 

216
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:47,254
magic,
which is science we don't understand 

217
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,534
yet.
You may have humiliated and hypnotized 

218
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,070
and conquered your enemy.
That's what you do.

219
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:59,440
Now in Shakespeare,
you say,

220
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,903
I'm giving it up.

221
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,640
So there's this fantastic famous speech 
at the end of,

222
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,503
of the,
of the templates where Prospero says 

223
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:12,451
that everything must dissolve.
Everything is like a play and everything

224
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:15,664
is just atoms.
And that seems to me that's the vision 

225
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,550
that's at the heart of Shakespeare 
because however solid you are,

226
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,593
however real,
the little stage or the little 

227
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:28,774
political,
I'm a territory you control is when it 

228
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:38,101
comes down to it.
What matters is the spiritual level,

229
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,850
which you may see as religious or you 
may see as a matter of conscience or you

230
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:43,684
may see a psychological,
but you have to recognize that you are 

231
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:51,340
not who you think you are.
And in a play,

232
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,593
that can be the first step.
What do you mean that you are not who 

233
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:55,060
you think you are?

234
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,780
Shakespeare tends to take the car,
take his tragedies,

235
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,280
um,
there about ambition.

236
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,203
Macbeth,
a man who's a soldier and wants to 

237
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,310
become king.
Um,

238
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,453
it's about king lear,
a man who at the end of his life is a 

239
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,830
king.
Um,

240
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,043
it may be a fellow.
I'm an African who believes in love as 

241
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,420
the most important thing in the world.
In those tragedies.

242
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,450
What happens is that in some way,
at some point,

243
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,493
they're forced to understand that their,
their passions and their human frailty 

244
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,530
destroy their self image.
So a king must find himself a beggar.

245
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,410
I'm someone who believes that the world 
is his to divide and rule or buckwheat,

246
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:50,860
other people,
that,

247
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:54,830
that guy has got to become homeless.
He's got to experience insanity.

248
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,060
If he does that,
then he's on a path towards big question

249
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:02,090
mark.
See,

250
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,880
because it,
Shakespeare is not.

251
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,750
He's not telling you where to go.
He's not telling you where you can be as

252
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:11,300
a dramatist.
He's holding the mirror up to nature.

253
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:13,740
The famous phrase to the,
um,

254
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,570
the complexity of human behavior and the
infinite fallibility of human judgment.

255
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,640
And for that reason,
um,

256
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,983
he's offering you images of failure in 
order to make you think about 

257
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,360
alternatives in your own life.
That

258
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,080
archetype or journey that you're 
describing,

259
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,183
a figure or hero or anti hero with a 
self image who over the course of the 

260
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:42,434
story has that self image destroyed,
seems read or learn of the early parts 

261
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:55,021
of the Siddhartha and religious stories 
where we are confronted with and and,

262
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:58,780
and to draw upon what you were saying 
about the tempest.

263
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,163
We're confronted with the futility of 
material pursuits were confronted with 

264
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,374
the futility of ideological or the 
frailty of ideological certainty that 

265
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,190
this experience will deliver us to 
impermanence.

266
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,670
Do you think it's your academic 
awareness that the tempest is likely his

267
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:24,970
final play and therefore the final 
speech in the tempest,

268
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,720
which seems to be saying everything's 
just an illusion.

269
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,470
Nothing's real.
Things are temporarily held together.

270
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,343
We're going to awaken from the dream 
into enlightenment without trying to 

271
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,270
give that a particular doctrinal.
Ben,

272
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:39,940
I,
he,

273
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,740
he don't give that over to Christianity.

274
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,710
He doesn't give that over to monarchy.
You said before,

275
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,480
one of the things that you loved about 
Shakespeare was he seems not to be bound

276
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,540
to any particular ideology that enabled 
him to play out the narrative of a young

277
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:59,851
woman or a slave or a king or a murderer
or a ct period,

278
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:00,500
you know,
like,

279
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,333
and like it's so quite well known that 
historical and geographical accuracy is 

280
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:09,970
not what you go to these plays for.
You go there for a deeper truth.

281
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,270
Our certain ru,
the,

282
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,203
what Shakespeare was saying was we were 
with what Shakespeare was talking about 

283
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:19,810
to a degree.
It made so much else was transcendence.

284
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,050
Well,
we said like Shakespeare,

285
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,750
right?
The last plate,

286
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:28,040
and it's called the templates as well.
We know it's not the last thing he wrote

287
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,540
because he didn't collaborate who does 
other people.

288
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,613
But if you look,
and this is where being an academic 

289
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:32,534
comes in and being able to read all the 
Shakespeare and get paid for it comes 

290
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:38,150
in.
If you get hold of a big book,

291
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,043
like the complete works of Shakespeare,
which incidentally I got when my dad 

292
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,420
came home from a week at the TUC.
Um,

293
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,263
he was a trade unionist,
but he'd sort of somehow gleam and the 

294
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:54,900
fact that I,
I'm at school was sort of interested in,

295
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,090
in,
in plays,

296
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,503
he went and bought me this complete 
works of Shakespeare and I sat down to 

297
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,880
read it.
Um,

298
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,030
and I remember reading King Lear while 
there was a football match on because it

299
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:07,460
was a Wednesday,
um,

300
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,530
and I was astonished by the fact that 
there was so much of this guy's work and

301
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,690
yet every single paragraph seemed to be 
kind of rich and challenging.

302
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,910
I don't think that's an ordinary 
reaction for a young boy with a football

303
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:21,744
and in the background,
I think you have a very particular 

304
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:26,400
relationship with that language,
but that's possible.

305
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,343
Um,
but,

306
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,533
but by reading so much of it,
you do get a sense of an 

307
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:34,590
autobiographical journey or a 
biographical journey,

308
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:37,290
which maybe isn't that conscious to 
begin with.

309
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,080
He does seem to be a conventional writer
of his time.

310
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,650
He writes big plays about history.
So to some extent he's latching onto the

311
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,180
fact that it's a patriotic time.
We,

312
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,230
we've just beat the Spaniards.
Um,

313
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,030
there's a queen on board and things are 
looking quite okay,

314
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:58,070
so let's,
let's cherish her and let's boost the,

315
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,870
the,
um,

316
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,460
the current ideology and the sense of 
national national wellbeing.

317
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,763
Gradually,
as you move through the end of the 15 

318
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:10,290
nineties into the 16 hundreds,
the queen's getting old,

319
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,330
people are becoming more,
more desperate about the future.

320
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,810
Um,
that social change is happening,

321
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,010
which involves the creation of a new 
landless comm class.

322
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,820
There's terrible homelessness.
Um,

323
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,600
uh,
at this time,

324
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,473
no.
Is there?

325
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,383
Yup.
Yup.

326
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,283
Like,
now,

327
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,980
like now,
like now there are people,

328
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:34,020
good sturdy base beggars,
30 beggars,

329
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,503
and if they come into your parish then 
your job is to whip them out the 

330
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,960
traditional English same as dealing with
a social problem.

331
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:43,794
Yeah,
absolutely.

332
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,970
Yeah.
Social cleansing and,

333
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,073
and that,
that begins to come through until the 

334
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:49,284
place themselves.
And so as the place become a richer and 

335
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:52,584
more complex psychologically,
they're also more outreaching and awe 

336
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:57,900
and shocked,
I think socially,

337
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,843
well,
when you get to the end of his career 

338
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,600
and he's only in his 40 [inaudible],
so he's not that kind of ancient.

339
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,000
Um,
there's a religious element,

340
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:06,923
a spiritual element,
a mythical element which runs through a 

341
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:11,970
whole load of plays,
uh,

342
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,863
their names for those of you who've got 
your pens and papers out because we 

343
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:16,554
should be learning the pricklies 
symbolizing the winter's tale and the 

344
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:22,494
tempest.

345
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,680
They all are mythical plays and they all
deal with those ideas that you,

346
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,140
you asked me about the beginning weeks 
ago,

347
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,270
um,
uh,

348
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,820
about parenthood,
but it's not the parenthood that,

349
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,983
um,
could be written up in a negative 

350
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,100
guidebook.
Okay?

351
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:41,963
If you read King Lear,
then you know how not to bring up your 

352
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:44,690
children.
Okay.

353
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,803
Instead,
they're about the mythical relationship 

354
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,490
between parents and children,
and they're about the life journey,

355
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,683
which every single person takes as an 
individual and every single person is 

356
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:57,634
there for tossed backwards and forwards 
by tempests flies between bliss and 

357
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:03,484
terror.
But it's not a complete journey because 

358
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,060
you as an individual must find a 
partner.

359
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:15,570
So love is part of the mythology and you
as a couple must create the future.

360
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,680
So parenting becomes the mythology.
So there's a,

361
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:26,730
there's a whole series of these mythical
dramas which take place in a world which

362
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:28,174
is partly real,
partly familiar because it's about 

363
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:32,690
family,
um,

364
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,650
partly because it's political,
it's about running countries,

365
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:41,130
but it's also a psychological and 
mythical and finally spiritual.

366
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:47,370
So it's not just in the tempest.
Prospero is this Megan's character.

367
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,813
Can someone named Megan.
I'm Amigas is a man who has political 

368
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:57,190
power but also spiritual and 
intellectual knowledge.

369
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,400
So it's a complete mess that you're 
aiming for.

370
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,013
And prosper was a character who aims for
that completeness but of really have it 

371
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,610
because nobody can.
And so in those plays,

372
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,533
there are glimpses of the divine 
literally divine where I'm in in the 

373
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:14,831
playpen.
Berkeley's,

374
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:16,640
which is a wonderful drama.
Um,

375
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,420
what happens?
It tells the life story.

376
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,240
There's a guy called [inaudible] who is 
a prince of tire,

377
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,703
um,
who at the beginning of the play 

378
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,740
encounters sexuality.
Um,

379
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,943
he's um,
presented as a folk tale character who 

380
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:34,384
must answer a riddle in order to love 
and when a beautiful princess while he 

381
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:41,740
does that,
but he discovers that the riddle is,

382
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,950
that the,
um,

383
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:48,010
the father king antiochus is actually 
abusing his daughter and making her live

384
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:52,060
in an incestuous relationship with her 
father.

385
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,470
Merkley's is so shattered by that.
He said he runs away.

386
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,910
He doesn't do what you're supposed to 
do.

387
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:02,260
He doesn't confront the issue and he 
goes into a sort of reclusive,

388
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:06,300
semi coma as he travels around the 
country and around the sea.

389
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,610
I'm from town to town encountering new 
groups of people and until finally,

390
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,833
um,
finding the first half of the plate and 

391
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,233
it happens all over again.
This repetition because we're talking 

392
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:21,220
about repetition is obsession because 
repetition is learning here.

393
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,833
So again,
he finds himself in a situation where 

394
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:28,300
there was a beautiful princess and this 
time he has to compete in sort of,

395
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:29,960
um,
uh,

396
00:23:29,961 --> 00:23:30,794
attorney [inaudible] I'm a has to defeat
other champions physically in order to 

397
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:39,520
win her hand.
What he wins her hand,

398
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,820
they marry,
they create a baby.

399
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:48,110
And then there's a tempest and she and 
we're halfway through the play.

400
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,841
Oh,
plot here.

401
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:50,370
That's the midpoint.
Yeah.

402
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,373
And again,
he goes into a coma this time he 

403
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:56,240
literally will not speak.
And for 12,

404
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,123
16 years,
he just becomes a kind of a very rich 

405
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,470
maritime tramp.
Oh,

406
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,430
that old chestnut.
The rich maritime trend.

407
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,293
Yes.
And He is told that his daughter is 

408
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:10,634
dead.
The daughter was given to some other 

409
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,900
people to bring up.
Well,

410
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:15,734
it turns out that this is late 
Shakespeare and without you really 

411
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:20,654
understanding at what point it happened,
but maybe it was the point of the 

412
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:23,444
tempest when nature seemed to be so 
opposed to everything human and when we 

413
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:33,530
were least able to achieve anything in 
our lives.

414
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,380
And there's no point being clever,
I can answer a riddle.

415
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,380
There's no point being brave.
I can beat a guy in a,

416
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,860
in a Cheveria competition.
And when the storm comes,

417
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,753
you're done for.

418
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,873
And even that perfect dream of,
of love and a child being born will be 

419
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,710
devastated.
Well,

420
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,770
that's only half the story.
The sea is about tempests,

421
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,920
but the sea is about currents and 
currents.

422
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:01,754
Drive you apart and bring you back.
So the end of that play will be when it 

423
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:09,620
turns out that nobody who is dead is 
dead.

424
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,343
The,
the,

425
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,893
the wife is alive and the daughter is 
alive and they all discover each other 

426
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,580
again.
And when they do,

427
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:25,110
there's the most amazing thing.
The music of the severes happens because

428
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,800
you're all,
you're always thinking with Shakespeare,

429
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,220
there's some sort of mythical or current
or shape to these,

430
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,083
this drama,
but it's so full of detail that you 

431
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:39,140
can't really see what it is.
But in these last place,

432
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:40,120
and especially in Paris,
please,

433
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,940
you do.
And um,

434
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,853
the,
the old man discovers that his daughter 

435
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,253
is alive.
The daughter discovers that her father 

436
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,720
is alive and they suddenly hear the 
music of the spheres.

437
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,220
And it's one of Shakespeare's greatest 
moments because we in the audience can't

438
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:02,054
hear it.
The people around these two suffering 

439
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,580
individuals can't hear it.
Only they can

440
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,120
because they've been on a journey.
And the rest of us haven't exactly.

441
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,690
So later in his career it was,
you're talking about divinity.

442
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:15,524
And he began their story with grant 
glimpses of the divine in you say that 

443
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:19,184
there's an argument that over the course
of his career as a writer or a 

444
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:26,951
philosopher or however we turned him,
he is gradually distilling these ideas.

445
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:33,200
There's a,
a clarity is beginning to emerge.

446
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,153
It,
it seems to me evidence that what's 

447
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:42,070
powerful is that he is fueled by an 
understanding of metaphysics.

448
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:47,550
Something that's very,
very difficult to convey,

449
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,380
but the,
the,

450
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,223
the material world,
the narrative itself that which is 

451
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,740
evident can only tell us so much that we
can't,

452
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:56,574
through materialism and through 
rationalism achieve contentment of 

453
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:03,210
perfection or completion.
Like you said,

454
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:04,044
with that perfectly story.
The first triumph leads to a period of 

455
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:07,614
unconsciousness coma.
The second period of the second trial 

456
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:11,843
leads to unconsciousness.
And it's only through s forces which 

457
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:19,950
cannot be contained or controlled.
Also through active innocence

458
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,240
lifted out of my story is that,
um,

459
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,340
uh,
the little daughter she grows up,

460
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,550
she finds herself confronted with 
sexuality too.

461
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,493
She's kidnapped and put in a brothel.
But because Shakespeare is always 

462
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,560
potentially tragic,
potentially comic,

463
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,690
she's in this ghastly tragic situation.
Um,

464
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,060
it would be beyond tragedies,
it's too obscene to be tragic,

465
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:48,570
but she charms everybody by playing 
music converts everybody who goes to the

466
00:27:48,641 --> 00:27:52,840
brothel into being chased,
which is a very funny scene.

467
00:27:52,841 --> 00:27:53,820
It's presented as,
as,

468
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,840
as a committee and because of her active
embrace of the finest elements in life,

469
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,210
and that image of music is always sort 
of symbolic.

470
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,580
I think of that.
Um,

471
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,723
it enables her to go onto the ship where
her psychotic father is waiting and 

472
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:18,190
she's the miracle.
The turns,

473
00:28:18,191 --> 00:28:21,290
the key that wakes him up.
Okay,

474
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,980
that really badly.
Um,

475
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,320
but it,
it's presenting you a picture of human,

476
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,640
um,
inadequacy,

477
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,343
but there's always the possibility that 
if you dedicate yourself to purity of 

478
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:43,090
spirit and compassion for others,
you can break through,

479
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,860
break through and help others.

480
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,610
So that's quite a strong ideological 
perspective.

481
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:51,460
That's quite sort of a religious idea,
Tony.

482
00:28:51,461 --> 00:28:51,870
That's right.

483
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,850
I mean,
and it may be because like everybody,

484
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,713
when they read Shakespeare,
if they've read Shakespeare or just to 

485
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,540
see one play or read one poem,
they,

486
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,370
they think they know what Shakespeare 
is.

487
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,380
And obviously I've been doing it for 
years,

488
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,273
so I think I know what Shakespeare is,
but I do actually believe that that's 

489
00:29:08,491 --> 00:29:09,450
what you can see,
you see,

490
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:12,330
you see that journey and in those 
particular powerful plays,

491
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,930
you find them acting out with increasing
clarity and simplicity.

492
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:21,260
And I mentioned the poems that I think 
anybody who would like to dash off after

493
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:27,120
hearing this podcast and think,
where can I,

494
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:27,750
when I,
can I,

495
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,960
where can I find Shakespeare in neat 
form?

496
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,740
I would say have a look at the poem 
called the Phoenix and the turtle.

497
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,710
Um,
it's one of his late lyrics.

498
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:40,470
It's a purely abstract piece,
purely metaphysical,

499
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,333
metaphorical oncotype or about the 
marriage between a phoenix and a turtle 

500
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:46,804
dove.

501
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,620
And it's a statement about the fact that
for Shakespeare,

502
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,633
at least at certain times in his life,
and it's the relationship between 

503
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,140
individuals through love,
romantic love,

504
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:04,830
marital love that breaks through.
It's about the paradox of two,

505
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:09,700
becoming one to be in one at the same 
time as they are two separate beings.

506
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,130
And so the finish and the turtle is a 
beautiful piece of work.

507
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,910
Um,
it's very challenging in,

508
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,900
in,
in ways that kind of metaphysical,

509
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,253
um,
but it does give you that statement and 

510
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:25,270
that everybody is capable in their lives
of achieving a miracle.

511
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,080
And love is that miracle.
That's really beautiful.

512
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,780
Moving on,
Tony,

513
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,080
to Shakespeare and Shakespeare,
I don't know,

514
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,510
legacy I suppose because you've done a 
lot of work in a,

515
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,993
I suppose decolonizing Shakespeare,
should we say you've done a lot of work 

516
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,750
on like a Shakespeare in Gender 
Shakespeare and race.

517
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,580
Tell us a bit about that stuff.

518
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,093
Yeah.
Well,

519
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,690
I've,
I've,

520
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,523
uh,
I've written this book called women as 

521
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:57,310
Hamlet,
which is good.

522
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,303
What I do is I look at performances,
I look at people's detailed perception 

523
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:04,510
reception,
um,

524
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,610
how they channel Shakespeare in 
different cultures and times.

525
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,420
And the women as hamlet book is about 
the way that,

526
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:17,730
um,
the historical gender assumptions of his

527
00:31:18,991 --> 00:31:22,080
time have been challenged from the 
moment that he wrote.

528
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,520
So I picked on hamlet because hamlet is 
the greatest player in the world.

529
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,593
That's in quotes,
but it's true because it's about the 

530
00:31:29,491 --> 00:31:30,324
growth of an individual personality or 
the things that we've been sort of 

531
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:33,200
talking about.
Um,

532
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,420
in terms of what you can see play by 
play a year by year,

533
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,990
I'm in Shakespeare's development.
You can see in hamlet as a play.

534
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,150
It's about someone who begins by not 
wanting to exist.

535
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,780
Um,
hamlet's father has died.

536
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,163
Um,
we will soon learn that he's been 

537
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:53,420
murdered.
I'm having it,

538
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,980
doesn't know that.
But as a result of that,

539
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,940
and he said,
oh,

540
00:31:56,941 --> 00:31:58,560
that this too,
too solid flesh would melt.

541
00:31:58,561 --> 00:31:59,394
He just wants to die himself.
But he's dragged into life by the ghost 

542
00:32:03,481 --> 00:32:08,481
of his father and step by step we see 
him undergoing transformations.

543
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,210
Okay?
Until the end he dies.

544
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,350
And we would like to say because if it 
was any other playwright,

545
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:21,270
we probably wouldn't be told what he has
learned [inaudible] and through to me

546
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,650
be more explicit.
Yeah.

547
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,573
So Shakespeare's don't offend his 
audience with this is what this means 

548
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:29,420
because he's part of his genius,
his workout,

549
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,280
and your own consciousness.

550
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,840
Exactly.
Hamlet's last words are,

551
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,330
the rest is silence.
Okay.

552
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,520
So we've all been waiting there for 
author's message,

553
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,893
but there isn't one.
I'm only the person who experiences 

554
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,510
complete obliteration,
knows the whole story of life.

555
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:49,400
And he's got nothing to say to us,
unless you're in those later plays,

556
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,650
you're going to move into this 
explicitly spiritual area.

557
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,940
But in hamlet you don't.
Anyway.

558
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,460
Hamlet is a great,
great play,

559
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,373
um,
but it's got to really feeble little 

560
00:32:57,681 --> 00:33:01,330
roles for women and what our theater and
got to eat a crap they.

561
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,563
Yeah.
Because they're not given much to do 

562
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:04,430
apart from say,
Oh,

563
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:08,180
hamlet and go mad and die.

564
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,340
That's right.
Um,

565
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,950
but within,
within a very short time,

566
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:18,340
women were playing hamlet.
How,

567
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,370
what do you mean?
Short time?

568
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,743
Um,
the first hamlet that I could find 

569
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:30,940
played by a woman is in the late 17th 
century,

570
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,820
100 years.
Then yeah,

571
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,420
roughly roughly.
Um,

572
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,330
and that can only be possible because,
um,

573
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,853
after the restoration period in the 
latter half of the 17th century and 

574
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,440
women were allowed on stage,
they weren't at all before that,

575
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,113
but once they were allowed on stage,
the paucity of the material that 

576
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:57,110
Shakespeare written for them in 
someplace became quite clear.

577
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,120
Um,
and so,

578
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:04,570
um,
it became quite common for women to take

579
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:09,170
on the role of hamlet.
And by the end of the 19th century,

580
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,063
there were hundreds who'd done so,
and we're not just talking about people 

581
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:13,574
in the,
I'm a little gidding amateur dramatic 

582
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:17,570
society.
We're talking about leading professional

583
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:18,404
actresses around the world to come that 
part because they recognized that the 

584
00:34:22,631 --> 00:34:24,730
things I was talking about just now,
um,

585
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,420
are so important.

586
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,530
And I talked to a lot of actresses,
um,

587
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,610
when I put that book together and they 
said,

588
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,340
people who played king,
who played him Ophelia,

589
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,200
or who played gertrude,
the mother,

590
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,510
they said,
um,

591
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,020
I really loved that play,
but it was so frustrating being in it.

592
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,680
I just wanted to speak those words.
Several said that to me,

593
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,853
I wanted to speak those words.
They felt trapped in one tiny aspect of 

594
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:53,360
the geometry of that play.
That's right.

595
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,403
And so what's happened is that at 
particular points in history when there 

596
00:34:58,611 --> 00:35:03,410
are major social changes that affect the
way that gender operates in a society,

597
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,690
um,
almost like a canary in a cage.

598
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,920
I'm an actress will say I want to play 
that part.

599
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:15,440
I will play that out in now because 
there's is going on.

600
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,460
Yeah,
yeah,

601
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,740
it's happening now.
I'm maxine peake,

602
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:25,100
maxine peake,
and did it and just today they announced

603
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,953
in the newspapers that you're going to 
be able to stream maximum peak 

604
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,540
performance of hamlet.

605
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,740
And she did it in Manchester in the 
Manchester Exchange,

606
00:35:33,741 --> 00:35:35,870
a theater in the round just a couple of 
years ago.

607
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:41,050
I'm in a where a lot of the roles were 
across campus too,

608
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:46,910
so it wasn't just one actress making the
big personal statement,

609
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,420
which is really,
really important in itself.

610
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:57,110
It's a company which is saying we've got
to embrace the feminine in these plays,

611
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,280
but also politically,
socially,

612
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,700
we've got to give more opportunities for
actresses to,

613
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,620
um,
to speak those words.

614
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,540
So it,
it's happening now.

615
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,970
Um,
and since I wrote the book,

616
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:10,180
which comes years ago,
um,

617
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,440
I've been talking to people in 
Australia,

618
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:18,600
I'm in Yugoslavia in America,
were recently until years ago.

619
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:21,180
They had the first black woman,
hamlet on record.

620
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:27,470
It's about having access to roles that 
give you agency,

621
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:35,150
but they also do more than that and they
allow you to alter the way audiences see

622
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:40,500
the world.
And you can,

623
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,170
you can do that in any old play,
um,

624
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,590
but to do it in,
in,

625
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,463
um,
in Shakespeare and ensures that people 

626
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,720
understand that you're challenging

627
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,130
old assumptions.
I see.

628
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:58,310
Because Shakespeare's like this open 
portal to the galaxy of what a human is.

629
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,190
Brilliant.
Yeah.

630
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:04,190
You need to see black actors,
female actors play these parts.

631
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,473
Otherwise there is the hetero genius 
assumption that what a human is is a 

632
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:12,090
white man.

633
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,880
That's right.
So since you mentioned the,

634
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:15,590
um,
the,

635
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,460
the race thing there,
um,

636
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,420
the,
the big,

637
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:20,254
big,
big ton of archetype of figure was the 

638
00:37:21,821 --> 00:37:24,490
great singer and actor,
Paul Robeson.

639
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,833
When is that?
He was born at the end of the beginning 

640
00:37:31,571 --> 00:37:34,870
of the 20th century.
His father was an escaped slave.

641
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,033
Bloody Hell.
Okay.

642
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,580
Um,
we're that close to history.

643
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,560
Um,
and he,

644
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,100
uh,
his father was a,

645
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,503
he was a reverend and ensured that Paul 
Young Pool had the best education 

646
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,520
possible.
And as a result of that,

647
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:53,230
he managed to get his into a black 
college.

648
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,190
And then he got into a mixed race law 
school.

649
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,523
Um,
he was a huge success on the football 

650
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:01,654
field.
He's the guy who first sang spirituals 

651
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:10,770
in the concert hall and made records,
and he's most,

652
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,630
most people know about him from the 
musical,

653
00:38:13,631 --> 00:38:17,490
showboat where he sang old man river.
Um,

654
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,720
and he was an actor as well.
So many talents.

655
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:24,200
It's an extraordinary,
um,

656
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,173
as a result of that,
he was invited to London to play a 

657
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:31,750
fellow in 1930 with a,
in the Savoy theater.

658
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:36,640
He was allowed on stage to play Othello.
He wasn't allowed in the restaurant.

659
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,950
You can't come to the after party for 
his own show.

660
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,940
Absolutely.
And in fact,

661
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,570
um,
some,

662
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:47,410
uh,
one critic walked out of the first night

663
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,543
because some black people had actually 
been allowed to be members of the 

664
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:52,400
audience.
I didn't come here to see black.

665
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,820
Oh yeah,
totally.

666
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,710
And Paul Robeson was also politically 
very astute.

667
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:00,544
So in fact,
he made a point of telling the prime 

668
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:04,370
minister about this.
Um,

669
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:09,570
so it became a public issue on who was 
painting then that I do not know when,

670
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:11,080
when are we talking about 19,
19,

671
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:12,460
30,
19,

672
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:13,294
30,
easy enough to find out where using the 

673
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:15,310
Internet.
But anyway,

674
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,630
the point is that,
um,

675
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:17,710
he,
yeah,

676
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,450
he wasn't using the Internet because 
they didn't have in those days,

677
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:21,610
but he was using the latest medium of 
radio,

678
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,340
so a,
around the first night,

679
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,490
Paul Robeson,
and because he was already so famous for

680
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:28,700
many things,
um,

681
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:29,703
gave a broadcast to people in America 
explaining that the reason why he was 

682
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:34,534
playing othello in London was because he
wouldn't be allowed to play it in New 

683
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,093
York.

684
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,063
Um,
and if he were to be seen to be kissing 

685
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:44,170
a white actress playing Desdemona,
his wife,

686
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,050
I'm in New York,
there would be severe trouble.

687
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,543
So,
and what he said attached to that was 

688
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,893
that a fellow who is this Morris African
general who was working for the army of 

689
00:39:58,661 --> 00:39:59,494
Venice in the 16th century but is 
regarded as basically sub human because 

690
00:40:07,181 --> 00:40:09,330
it was an ethnicity.
Um,

691
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:13,780
he says that the situation that this 
character Othello has,

692
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:18,781
which is going to end in death and 
disaster is victimized.

693
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:19,643
I victimization.
And the situation of a fellow destroyed 

694
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,993
in the 16th century in Italy is exactly 
the same as that of any person of color 

695
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,023
on the streets of America now,
so 1930 number one Paul Robeson black 

696
00:40:38,621 --> 00:40:43,621
actor is playing a part up until then 
played by white actors makeup,

697
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,440
so he's claiming to have a real physical
presence on the stage.

698
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,033
And number two,
he's saying in the process that the 

699
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:53,704
plays that William Shakespeare wrote,
all those hundreds of years ago in so 

700
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:57,783
far as they are true are true about the 
injustices of today and we're going to 

701
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:07,780
use these plays to make sure we're not 
just seen on the stage physically in the

702
00:41:07,781 --> 00:41:08,614
Savoy theater.
We're going to be seen on the world 

703
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,490
stage and okay,
you in America are not going to come,

704
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,410
but you now know about it from the 
radio.

705
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,413
He politicized that content and 
activated it is content that was there 

706
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,463
late and he was able to utilize.
And I suppose that's brilliant activism 

707
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:31,420
as well as brilliant art and there's 
definitely a crossover.

708
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,130
How do you see Shakespeare being

709
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,830
used in that way these days?

710
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:41,450
Well,
to be focused purely on the,

711
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:43,340
um,
the um,

712
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,263
race ethnicity aspect you mentioned 
right at the start and we've had a 

713
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:49,780
project,
um,

714
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,793
we're at university where I teach,
which is called multicultural 

715
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:55,214
Shakespeare and it's a study of black 
and Asian performance since Paul 

716
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,820
Robeson's Day I'm working in 
Shakespeare.

717
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,323
Um,
and so we've got to get put together a 

718
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:07,150
big database of,
uh,

719
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,113
as many of those performances as we've 
managed to trace with as much 

720
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:11,054
information about the performance 
directors and other black and Asian 

721
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:19,990
artists who've been involved in it.
And we put together the,

722
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:21,710
um,
the database.

723
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,573
And I'm about two years ago we published
the results which showed that number 

724
00:42:28,821 --> 00:42:30,130
one.
Um,

725
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,973
and,
and this was why I did it in the first 

726
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:32,414
place.
There was a great history of people of 

727
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:38,540
color playing shakespeare in this 
country,

728
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,740
which is hardly known.
Number two,

729
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,030
there's a glass ceiling I'm watching.

730
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,880
Two years ago we could say that there 
had not been a,

731
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:52,250
a,
a black hamlet in this country.

732
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,173
Wow.
Um,

733
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,820
uh,
they had not been a black Korea.

734
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:01,890
Elena's pick a great role and you'll 
find that even though with um,

735
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,043
with immigration,
I'm going right back to the 19 forties 

736
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:08,580
in this country.
Okay.

737
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:09,783
Um,
and with generations coming through and 

738
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,460
finding their way into new industries,
isn't,

739
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,313
isn't everything else.
Although there was a big body of great 

740
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:18,284
talent,
they weren't being given access to the 

741
00:43:21,321 --> 00:43:23,660
really significant roles.
I'm.

742
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,793
The reason for doing this was that 
Shakespeare is the symbol of British 

743
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:33,520
culture that everyone can understand.
And if you had,

744
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:37,520
if you have access to that,
then you have access to something at the

745
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:40,400
core of our society.
If you don't,

746
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,750
then you don't have access.

747
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,323
Interesting.
Shakespeare's deeply political then 

748
00:43:44,741 --> 00:43:49,741
because you're continually pushing to 
ensure that access is given in that what

749
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,753
Shakespeare represent and therefore what
Britain represents or what power 

750
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,003
represents is challenged and altered in 
a and I suppose in a more equal and 

751
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:04,720
inclusive way.
Yeah.

752
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,613
Yeah.
Why?

753
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,780
Why?
Why does it matter?

754
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:08,614
Or why does it matter to you?
Why this personal crusade when 

755
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:14,500
potentially you could be?
Gosh,

756
00:44:14,501 --> 00:44:17,230
I suppose there's one way of dealing 
with Shakespeare that would be right.

757
00:44:17,231 --> 00:44:20,140
What does this play mean?
What's the best performance of it?

758
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,910
Was the best way of delivering that 
line?

759
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,030
What females are there that you know,
to a CSA?

760
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,790
Is it not an abstraction to politicize 
it?

761
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,920
Do you see that as a continuation of the
content?

762
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,500
It's the content is the content.

763
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,410
Can I read you a speech which I just 
happen to have brought with me please?

764
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,423
Okay.
Obviously I said a bit ago that what I 

765
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:45,270
do with Shakespeare or what I see 
Shakespeare as being about,

766
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,930
um,
is to some extent an accidental.

767
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,123
It's me and um,
the whole point about so many 

768
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:54,804
shakespeare plays is that they all say 
farewell to the audience at the end and 

769
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,950
the,
the for applause.

770
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,020
But they're saying,
okay,

771
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,093
we've had a show.
We're all in a state of solidarity with 

772
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:08,730
the audience,
but actually we're not the audience.

773
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:09,623
The collective being we are lots of 
individuals and you will all see what 

774
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:13,374
you've just seen in a different way and 
you were thinking about it differently 

775
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,373
when you go home.
So my view of Shakespeare is purely me 

776
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,413
and I'm Shakespeare is mediated mediated
through the movies that you've seen or 

777
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:28,163
based on Shakespeare,
like that excellent tempest or the 

778
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:33,240
production that you saw on,
uh,

779
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:38,190
on,
on beamed down from the national theater

780
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:44,300
and it's mediated through editors,
um,

781
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,260
editions.

782
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,373
Um,
everybody gets in the way of 

783
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:48,174
Shakespeare.
There is however one speech by 

784
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:56,060
Shakespeare written in his own hand,
um,

785
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,440
and that's a speak,
which is in the British library.

786
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,823
It's from a play that was never 
performed in his time and called Thomas 

787
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:05,483
[inaudible].
It's not a great statement by him 

788
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:10,680
because it's a play that he wrote in 
collaboration with lots of other people.

789
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,110
Um,
but miraculously one speech has survived

790
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:18,540
in his handwriting is the only one.
How do we know?

791
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:19,581
Well,
that,

792
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:20,414
that's good.
I'm glad you say that because that's 

793
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:26,790
your job to interrogate,
tend to destroy a myths.

794
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,760
And to some extent,
we know that he wrote it because we know

795
00:46:32,761 --> 00:46:36,780
he was given the job of working on this 
particular script and through looking at

796
00:46:36,781 --> 00:46:38,610
his handwriting,
at looking at the spelling,

797
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,300
looking at the imagery,
um,

798
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,110
scholars have deduced that it must be 
him,

799
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:44,520
but of course,
um,

800
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:45,563
that isn't in a bit of a circular 
argument because to say this is like 

801
00:46:50,581 --> 00:46:52,440
Shakespeare,
therefore Shakespeare must've written it

802
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,660
is.
We wouldn't hold up in a court of law,

803
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:56,070
I think nowadays,
but anyway,

804
00:46:56,370 --> 00:47:01,370
I'm pretty well 99 percent of 
Shakespeare scholars like me would agree

805
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,410
that he wrote this great.
And this is what it's about.

806
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,450
Um,
it's a,

807
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,230
it's a play about Sir Thomas Moore,
who was the,

808
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:09,000
um,
uh,

809
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,273
I think chancellor,
I'm in Henry the eighth day and there 

810
00:47:12,421 --> 00:47:17,421
was a riot against immigrants and he was
sent out to quell the right.

811
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,060
And this is the speech which I would 
read out there.

812
00:47:21,061 --> 00:47:22,090
I think we better if you did.
No,

813
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:24,300
you did it.
I'm going to show up.

814
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:25,650
I need no encouragement.
Okay.

815
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,200
So this is Thomas Moore and he's 
addressing this,

816
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,810
this group of,
um,

817
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,980
a xenophobic racist rioters in London.

818
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,850
And then he goes on strangers,
okay.

819
00:47:41,851 --> 00:47:42,684
That the,
you know,

820
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,450
do we call them,
um,

821
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,920
uh,
refugees do because the migrants,

822
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,330
um,
the,

823
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:53,260
the vocabulary you use will color the 
way people understand who they are.

824
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:57,100
And in this case they're strangers you 
will put down,

825
00:47:57,101 --> 00:48:00,430
strangers killed them,
cut their throats,

826
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,400
possess their houses.
Alas,

827
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:04,320
alas,
say saint.

828
00:48:04,321 --> 00:48:07,900
Now the king should banish you with what
you go,

829
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:14,100
what country by the nature of your error
should give you harbor view to France or

830
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:18,670
flanders to any German province,
Spain or Portugal Ne.

831
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:23,790
Anywhere that not ideas to England.
Why you must need to be strangers.

832
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,193
Would you be pleased to find a nation of
such barbarous temper that breaking out 

833
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:33,340
in hideous violence would not afford you
in a boat on earth,

834
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,880
wet that it tested knives against your 
throat's spoon,

835
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:37,714
you like dogs.
And like as if that God owed not nor 

836
00:48:40,391 --> 00:48:41,224
made,
not you.

837
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,980
What would you think to be used?
Thus,

838
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:50,970
this is the strangest case and this your
mountain ish in humanity.

839
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,023
So I might get struck out of the 
Shakespeare experts club for saying the 

840
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:00,874
fact that this was probably written by 
Shakespeare in his own handwriting and 

841
00:49:04,481 --> 00:49:08,500
it's the only speech by Shakespeare that
has survived in that form is irrelevant.

842
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,080
But,
um,

843
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,180
it's an example of the way that,
uh,

844
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:15,010
a piece of text,
a piece of writing,

845
00:49:15,011 --> 00:49:20,011
a piece of dramatic writing could be 
very controversial in its time.

846
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,210
It was censored or not performed.
Really?

847
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:26,230
Yeah.
Um,

848
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:27,580
the,
um,

849
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,820
the,
uh,

850
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,973
the,
the,

851
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,230
the sensor.
Mr Tilney wrote,

852
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:37,270
leave out the insurrection holy and the 
cause there have and not otherwise,

853
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:40,150
but your own perils.
Yeah.

854
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,400
So it didn't right in the center of that
bit.

855
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,510
That's encouraging gaps would be nice.
Yeah.

856
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,730
So maybe shakespeare just did that 
because someone said,

857
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:49,810
oh,
can you do this speech?

858
00:49:49,811 --> 00:49:50,920
And he said,
I'm knocking off.

859
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,180
All right.
Um,

860
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:55,000
or it may be that it was a speech he 
felt passionately about,

861
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,580
but I think we have a right to feel 
passionately about it now.

862
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:03,210
And to say that I'm the one occasion 
when Shakespeare does appear to be.

863
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:08,371
I'm speaking directly about society,
about intolerance,

864
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,300
about xenophobic tendencies,
um,

865
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,330
he's doing it in those terms which are 
so true to us now.

866
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,453
And when you said right at the start,
what did I mean when I said that 

867
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,830
Shakespeare encourages us to realize 
that we're not who we think they are.

868
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,533
That's what this picture is about,
is saying to the honest London citizens 

869
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,480
of the 16th century,
okay,

870
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,050
well put yourself in their shoes.
Yes.

871
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,453
And think what a disgusting life you 
will lead and hold up a mirror to 

872
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:43,090
yourself.

873
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:43,923
Anyway,
this is the role of the Shaman is that 

874
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:46,983
Shakespeare can fall into the 
perspective of sort of almost anything 

875
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,214
and present so many views and in this 
case invites us to look at what we 

876
00:50:59,321 --> 00:51:01,240
consider to be objective.
Really true.

877
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:03,490
I am English.
That is alien.

878
00:51:03,491 --> 00:51:05,130
This is otherness.
And the,

879
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:05,651
the,
the,

880
00:51:05,651 --> 00:51:06,484
those categories can continually shift.
Just by moving to another place you 

881
00:51:10,091 --> 00:51:11,710
aren't,
you are now the stranger.

882
00:51:11,711 --> 00:51:15,160
The Stranger is you.
Is Only circumstance.

883
00:51:15,161 --> 00:51:19,300
The temporal that present.
She seemed to you to be objective.

884
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,990
So if someone that has access to a multi
valence can say,

885
00:51:22,991 --> 00:51:23,290
no,
no,

886
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:23,621
no,
no,

887
00:51:23,621 --> 00:51:24,910
nothing is real,
nothing is real,

888
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,420
and it seems that that in the end 
becomes his conclusion.

889
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,720
Now these evidently there is power in 
this writing because the,

890
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:36,973
the time it was censored.
And to touch again on what you said 

891
00:51:40,301 --> 00:51:42,370
about is it poor ropes.
And um,

892
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,520
I,
I know from the research that Gareth did

893
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:50,521
with you that there's a story about the 
CIA attempting to censure like 500 years

894
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:52,910
later,
the,

895
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:53,900
the,
uh,

896
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:55,640
Paul Robeson's,
uh,

897
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,840
experiences performing Shakespeare.
Can you tell us about that place?

898
00:51:58,841 --> 00:51:59,160
Yeah.

899
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,810
Because like I said,
everyone,

900
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,130
um,
uh,

901
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,950
he wasn't content to do Shakespeare 
because it's a great play.

902
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,173
Um,
he did it because he saw it as a great 

903
00:52:07,651 --> 00:52:08,610
role,
um,

904
00:52:08,611 --> 00:52:09,444
for a black performer and beyond that he
saw it as a great indictment of racial 

905
00:52:14,611 --> 00:52:15,444
attitudes.
This is 1930 and he's a newcomer to 

906
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,190
transcript theater.
Um,

907
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,560
and he's a stranger in the world of 
British classical drama,

908
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,980
but he goes in there.
Well,

909
00:52:31,981 --> 00:52:32,814
that's easy.
He could have become the next Martin 

910
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,860
Luther King,
Martin Luther King.

911
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:43,170
And if he had a pretty good idea,
it'll make sense in 20 years.

912
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:45,360
Exactly,
exactly.

913
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:46,640
And in fact,
when it came to it,

914
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,493
Martin Luther King in the 50th didn't 
want to be in any way grouped with the 

915
00:52:51,361 --> 00:52:54,330
name of Paul Robeson because Paul 
Robeson was also a socialist.

916
00:52:56,430 --> 00:53:01,430
And being a socialist in the 19 thirties
means that you are,

917
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:02,683
um,
antifascist it means you're pro Russian 

918
00:53:05,371 --> 00:53:09,150
revolution.
It means that your feet dirty,

919
00:53:09,151 --> 00:53:12,450
communist,
according to the FBI in,

920
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:13,383
in,
in America.

921
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,353
Um,
and so they were very concerned to 

922
00:53:20,191 --> 00:53:22,950
silence ropes and,
um,

923
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:24,023
it's the time of mccarthyism were ropes 
and actually appeared before the 

924
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:30,520
Mccarthy Committee and announced them as
anti American as,

925
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,080
as Americans.
You don't ask them as only Americans.

926
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,340
Um,
extraordinary.

927
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,271
Uh,
his wife,

928
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:38,010
by the way,
did the same thing and she was brilliant

929
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:38,853
to think that have enough bloody 
problems without going up against 

930
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,960
mccarthyism.
Yeah,

931
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:43,970
exactly.
Um,

932
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:48,720
and he was given many opportunities to,
to narrow his focus,

933
00:53:48,721 --> 00:53:53,040
to shut up on the subjects that were so 
contentious,

934
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,610
but he wouldn't,
uh,

935
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,740
so he was blacklisted.
Um,

936
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:03,640
and the irony is the authority on that 
list.

937
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,550
So he couldn't perform in America.

938
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:06,913
Um,
all his recording contracts were 

939
00:54:09,061 --> 00:54:10,260
abolished.
Oh God.

940
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,363
Um,
but that's okay because he's an 

941
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,560
internationally celebrated international
celebrity.

942
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:17,220
He's also the black that is also the 
first black film star.

943
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:20,520
He made great films.
I'm in the 19 thirties,

944
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,673
um,
so we could easily come to another 

945
00:54:23,071 --> 00:54:28,071
country like England or Wales or France 
and perform here.

946
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:34,130
And so they took his passport away so he
can't perform in America.

947
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:37,440
He can't perform abroad.
Um,

948
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,573
and um,
he found extraordinary ways of getting 

949
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:41,600
round that,
um,

950
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,170
he gave a concert,
for instance,

951
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:47,850
on the American side of the Canadian 
border to Canadians.

952
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,390
He did that as an annual thing.
Um,

953
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:57,290
he used the new power of the,
um,

954
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:58,183
of the telephone that they,
they'd later and Atlantic telephone 

955
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:04,470
cable in the fifties.
And as a result of that,

956
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,333
he was able to give concerts from his 
flat in New York and to some pancreas 

957
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:11,124
town hall.

958
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:18,740
And we did an exhibition about that and 
I displayed the phone bill.

959
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,630
Oh,
okay.

960
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,940
How much?
Well,

961
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:24,803
there was a dispute over the phobia.
They tried to make it so expensive you 

962
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:29,190
couldn't afford to do it,
but trade unionists in London,

963
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:30,480
um,
uh,

964
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,060
came up with the cash so it could 
happen.

965
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:35,130
So,
um,

966
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,380
it's even the case,
um,

967
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:39,840
that some people,
including me,

968
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:42,140
would argue that,
uh,

969
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,660
ultimately at the end of the fifth is,
um,

970
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:49,680
the CIA decided that because these,
um,

971
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:50,663
conventional censorship techniques 
weren't working because he was 

972
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:58,650
determined to find ways of surmounting 
censorship.

973
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,150
Um,
for instance,

974
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:01,560
uh,
yes,

975
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:03,590
he wasn't allowed to,
um,

976
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,040
to work with the,
with the American record companies.

977
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,083
So he founded his own company,
a fellow records which published his 

978
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,220
records,
his,

979
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,180
uh,
he carried his music,

980
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,620
but also that people like Pete Seeger,
um,

981
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,690
people on,
on the left,

982
00:56:21,691 --> 00:56:24,160
people who were going to be the,
the is in 10 years,

983
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,033
20 years time.

984
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:29,230
It's impossible to imagine that ever 
such a man that existed,

985
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:33,970
but he did because of his bravery,
his determination,

986
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:40,670
his absolute commitment and his 
determination not to compromise.

987
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,410
So anyway,
um,

988
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:45,820
finally,
um,

989
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:50,821
his passport was given back to him 
because it was ruled unconstitutional to

990
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:54,250
take the person's passport away for 
political purposes.

991
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:55,723
Um,
so he left America at the end of the 

992
00:56:57,851 --> 00:57:01,990
fifth years and came back to Europe,
to Russia for instance,

993
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:07,400
and in Russia his life changed.
Um,

994
00:57:07,401 --> 00:57:10,540
he'd already performed a fellow here in 
England.

995
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:12,700
It's rapid,
uneven at the age of 60,

996
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:18,930
and he'd already been in on the ground 
floor of the Notting Hill Carnival.

997
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,650
Wow.
He was a sponsor for the very first one.

998
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:25,563
Um,
he went to Moscow where he was hugely 

999
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:30,904
popular and was planning to go to Cuba 
when he was taken extremely ill and his 

1000
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:42,370
son,
Paul ribs and junior,

1001
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:45,430
um,
believed that he was,

1002
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:46,383
um,
experimented on by the CIA using you 

1003
00:57:49,571 --> 00:57:50,950
mind bending drugs.

1004
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,370
Um,
he was taken instantly ill,

1005
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:59,520
Paul Robeson,
and he became profoundly mentally unwell

1006
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,323
for the rest of his life.
He was physically destroyed because his 

1007
00:58:04,121 --> 00:58:06,850
mind and couldn't make his whole system 
work anymore.

1008
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,073
Anyway,
his son in Moscow was in Paul Robeson's 

1009
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,173
hotel room after he'd gone into hospital
and he had this suicidal compulsion to 

1010
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:19,174
throw himself out the window.
So that convinced him that the CIA were 

1011
00:58:22,931 --> 00:58:24,850
behind the drugs.
Um,

1012
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:29,680
so that can be same,
that it was a drug induced psychosis and

1013
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:30,514
that the cio will behind it because we 
know that they have plans to do that 

1014
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:33,590
sort of thing.
Um,

1015
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,940
to um,
uh,

1016
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,180
to Castro.
Well,

1017
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,173
the clincher for me is that I'm Paul 
Robeson was about to go by air from 

1018
00:58:43,091 --> 00:58:47,920
Moscow to Cuba as part of his world tour
and he was

1019
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:52,870
time you might want to not go on a tour.
They include,

1020
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:57,940
must go on tokenistic blow money.

1021
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:58,990
Yeah,
that's today that,

1022
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:02,280
that's why it's impossible to imagine 
that ever such a person existed,

1023
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:03,923
especially because he did not know,
but the CIA probably did that when he 

1024
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:10,080
got to Moscow.
So when you got to Cuba,

1025
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,780
the Bay of Pigs,
we scheduled etl.

1026
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,193
So I'm,
I'm pretty convinced all the evidence 

1027
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:21,190
has been redacted that we know about.
Um,

1028
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,133
I,
I spent six months going through FBI 

1029
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:28,380
files that you can get on the Internet.
Um,

1030
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,413
and it's quite clear that it says the 
health of Paul Robeson is an issue and 

1031
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:35,420
then pages and pages of nothing but 
black.

1032
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,540
Um,
so I'm convinced that the one thing they

1033
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:42,620
did not want would be that Paul Robeson,
a fierce,

1034
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:43,543
ferocious critic of American foreign 
policy would be in Cuba when they 

1035
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:48,014
invaded it and that,
that would be the point at which 

1036
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,080
censorship and oppressive,
um,

1037
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:59,560
a behavior designer decides it's not 
enough.

1038
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:05,670
Shakespeare then has power in it.
A great deal of power,

1039
01:00:05,831 --> 01:00:06,664
I suppose it has.
It's inconceivably varied well of human 

1040
01:00:13,121 --> 01:00:13,954
experience with recognizable themes that
are seeing in many senses to talk about 

1041
01:00:18,911 --> 01:00:19,744
the futility of power in a way.
The people that were persecuted in a 

1042
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:24,993
pull ropes in would have done well to 
sort of read some of those plays and go 

1043
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:32,320
out in a minute based system which are 
on a prop up is pointless.

1044
01:00:32,321 --> 01:00:33,580
Look,
it's all temporary.

1045
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,060
They should just let him off.
Uh,

1046
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:36,580
so,
um,

1047
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,980
in a way,
how,

1048
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:44,030
how do you see this resource?
We have this sort of almost,

1049
01:00:44,351 --> 01:00:45,360
it's,
I suppose it,

1050
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:49,150
I mean it's obviously a unique resource 
that we have a,

1051
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,720
I,
I,

1052
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:56,530
an artistic work of such potency that is
owned,

1053
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,393
I suppose by the English language,
not necessarily by their englishness 

1054
01:01:01,751 --> 01:01:06,751
itself is like how do,
how do you envisage it being utilized to

1055
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:10,030
continue the debate around power and how
power is shared,

1056
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,260
what are,
what do you see your obligations as,

1057
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,100
as a,
as a,

1058
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:14,933
as a shakespeare expert.
You called yourself that and you beat 

1059
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:20,210
your chest as you said it.
And uh,

1060
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:21,983
and uh,
and how can other people also made 

1061
01:01:23,711 --> 01:01:26,460
invisible quotation marks in the air at 
the same time you did that year?

1062
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:28,860
There's a lot of weird things went on 
there for Mandy.

1063
01:01:28,861 --> 01:01:33,400
So I'm interested in language Marcel 
Marceau across the table now.

1064
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,320
Um,
how can we,

1065
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:38,620
how can those of us that are interested 
in power utilize shakespeare?

1066
01:01:38,621 --> 01:01:39,630
What,
what would you like

1067
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,510
see happen?
What you're going to do?

1068
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,990
The,
the responsibility is to young people.

1069
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:51,530
Um,
it's important that whether your,

1070
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:53,280
um,
your,

1071
01:01:53,281 --> 01:01:57,150
uh,
South Asian kid in Leicester,

1072
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:02,900
um,
whether your a kid with parents who came

1073
01:02:04,081 --> 01:02:05,730
from Ghana,
um,

1074
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:10,850
and you live in Glasgow,
whether you're a kid in Poland,

1075
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,353
it's really important that these plays 
touch you directly when your views of 

1076
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:21,804
life are being formulated.
It's about getting to hear the stories 

1077
01:02:26,611 --> 01:02:31,611
and to see the stories acted out.
It's about getting to speak the words.

1078
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,690
Okay.
Um,

1079
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:35,070
that,
that's really what it's about,

1080
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,320
the empowerment that comes through 
language.

1081
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,833
If,
if Shakespeare had just given us the 

1082
01:02:39,661 --> 01:02:41,940
stories in the form that I've kind of 
paraphrased them,

1083
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:46,800
they would have been crap,
but Shakespeare stood up,

1084
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:48,040
right?
It's this bloke,

1085
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:49,840
right?
And he's a bit worried about.

1086
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,600
So that's right.
Yeah,

1087
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,970
that's exactly what I said and I'm 
really ashamed of it.

1088
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:55,750
And I hope you obliterate the tape.
No,

1089
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:58,500
you've done a wonderful job of 
shakespeare.

1090
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,500
One one thing,
for instance,

1091
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:03,983
when we've been talking to people with 
Asian family backgrounds about 

1092
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:09,770
Shakespeare,
um,

1093
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,090
uh,
it's often said to me,

1094
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:13,003
and it's families were more than one 
languages spoken at home that really 

1095
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:19,494
respond instantly.
You're most richly to Shakespeare's 

1096
01:03:21,691 --> 01:03:22,524
language because if you,
if you're language senses being 

1097
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:30,660
stretched all the time and you're aware 
of how ample it can be,

1098
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:36,170
and so you aren't.
I'm deterred by the weirdness,

1099
01:03:36,331 --> 01:03:40,290
the opaqueness of the backwardness of 
Shakespeare's a written language.

1100
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,590
It's another possible way of looking at 
life,

1101
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:44,910
of,
of expressing yourself.

1102
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:48,300
And so there's something very,
very multicultural about the,

1103
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:51,600
the,
the words themselves in that sense I say

1104
01:03:51,601 --> 01:03:54,170
because they're abstract even from 
contemporary English speakers,

1105
01:03:54,171 --> 01:03:55,004
so the levels yet,
and it's so much poetry or shakespeare 

1106
01:03:57,901 --> 01:03:58,734
will always use an image if you can,
rather than give you a prosaic sentence 

1107
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:07,250
and imagery works on your imagination 
and in ways that you're not aware of and

1108
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:09,360
obviously that Shakespeare would never 
ever dreamt.

1109
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:12,330
Um,
but if you can give young people that,

1110
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,710
then it's,
it's part of the weaponry that they need

1111
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:19,380
to get through being young.
Um,

1112
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:22,670
and hopefully,
um,

1113
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:27,830
it's part of their sense of potential 
identity.

1114
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:29,004
You see what you said,
that in a way there's something of a 

1115
01:04:32,131 --> 01:04:34,650
shaman about Shakespeare.
I actually do think that,

1116
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:35,603
but I would be thrown out of the 
Shakespeare experts club if I said that 

1117
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:43,160
too many people and what it is 
restrictive in that club in it.

1118
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,520
It is,
it is,

1119
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:49,610
you should see them God penguin suits,
but he's an actor.

1120
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:55,170
Shakespeare is an actor and a 
playwright,

1121
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,960
and his job as an actor is to um,
embody different people.

1122
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:03,503
His job as a playwright is to make the 
Panorama as complex and diverse as 

1123
01:05:10,081 --> 01:05:10,914
possible.
So Shakespeare is one of those writers 

1124
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:16,530
who,
because he's a playwright,

1125
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:19,210
is always disagreed with themselves.
Yeah.

1126
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,113
Um,
and that's why we are so lucky to have 

1127
01:05:23,471 --> 01:05:25,430
him as our national board,
um,

1128
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,463
as opposed to some great novelists like 
tolstoy who is ultimately bound to be 

1129
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:33,304
dogmatic at some point because the 
narrator's voice will always interfere 

1130
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:39,400
with the accuracy of what he's telling 
you,

1131
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,293
I say,
but Shakespeare is never in that 

1132
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:43,030
situation

1133
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:43,863
because the form is about story and the 
story is populated by character and the 

1134
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:50,650
character's must have opposition.
So you must have multi valence.

1135
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:51,161
Whereas,
yeah,

1136
01:05:51,161 --> 01:05:54,760
in an narrative for a narrative forms 
such as the novel,

1137
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:57,880
as you say,
the narrator has dominion,

1138
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,960
so you say it's important for people to 
inhabit these parts,

1139
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:04,870
to speak the words because it's kind of 
A.

1140
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:09,220
I said Alan Moore to say about like 
spells and language.

1141
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:14,020
That language will go work on you and 
when we did that week of we did a word a

1142
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:14,853
week of workshops with the National 
Theater and the brilliant director in 

1143
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:21,310
Rickson where I've read different 
monologues in different scenes.

1144
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:22,413
It what I found is it's like a language 
is literally a code and the code in the 

1145
01:06:27,371 --> 01:06:28,204
hands of a master like Shakespeare and 
illuminated by an expert such as 

1146
01:06:31,601 --> 01:06:34,390
yourself and a director would bring into
the in the that you.

1147
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,223
I felt like when doing Kaliban and 
prospero arguing about the change of 

1148
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:42,920
their relationship since prosper.
I've been on the island a while and like

1149
01:06:42,921 --> 01:06:45,100
he wasn't not nice to caliber in 
anymore.

1150
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,113
I felt the adolescent may breathe back 
in a life with that sort of spurned 

1151
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:55,741
sense of rage or when you work through 
the grace of hamlet,

1152
01:06:56,950 --> 01:07:01,090
you are forced into unexamined corners 
of the mind,

1153
01:07:01,091 --> 01:07:03,910
are forced to confront aspects of your 
consciousness.

1154
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:04,903
If the language for it doesn't exist,
then the phenomena itself is perhaps 

1155
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:12,280
doesn't ignored or it doesn't.
If it's not illuminated,

1156
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,910
if there's no language for it or is it 
only the things that.

1157
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:17,560
There are words for being sad.

1158
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:19,040
That's so great.
I'm like,

1159
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:19,874
take hamlet,
need nearly all of hamlet's famous 

1160
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,490
liquids which are so famous to be or not
to be able to have it.

1161
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,570
And they nearly all.
Um,

1162
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:30,260
if you go back to the earliest texts,
begin with,

1163
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:32,870
oh,
there's an exclamation mark.

1164
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,353
Okay.
Um,

1165
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,950
how do you say,
Oh,

1166
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:41,540
the only way you can do that is to 
actually capture that emotion.

1167
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:43,413
Whether you're on stage saying it or 
whether you're sitting at home reading 

1168
01:07:46,971 --> 01:07:47,804
it,
it's a point of contact between you and 

1169
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:53,234
that text [inaudible].
There's something which is not fully 

1170
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:59,660
controlled and defined and limited.

1171
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,780
That's pretty beautiful because it's not
like,

1172
01:08:01,781 --> 01:08:02,614
yeah,
because if it starts with the word 

1173
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:08,440
potato potatoes here I can and I know 
those,

1174
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:09,853
um,
but like it is like it's an open sound 

1175
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:16,690
exclamation and you've got to go work on
yourself psychologically.

1176
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,533
It's a bit like a springboard,

1177
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,230
uh,
the bonds you,

1178
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,300
you know,
you're going to be in the.

1179
01:08:22,301 --> 01:08:24,390
I'm in the water.
Okay.

1180
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:27,080
And you've got to swim in a certain way 
or else you'll sink.

1181
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,360
Um,
but how do you get there?

1182
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,800
Oh,
we'll take you there.

1183
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:31,813
So it's really saying as an actor,
writing consumer can do this and we're 

1184
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,213
saying collaborate,
give me a bit of you and then I'll give 

1185
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:41,680
you the words fucking

1186
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,480
so you would not precious guy.
That's what you like about him as well,

1187
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:45,950
isn't it?
The Shakespeare is not precious.

1188
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,610
You said it's like robust.
Okay.

1189
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:50,100
You can go.
You can't be convinced,

1190
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,150
like being conservative with 
Shakespeare.

1191
01:08:52,151 --> 01:08:53,630
Is that miss the point sort of go,
oh no,

1192
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,400
Shakespeare has got to be some blonde 
bloke.

1193
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:58,220
I mean handle it rather it has got to be
some blonde bloke.

1194
01:08:58,221 --> 01:08:59,054
It's not like Christianity where 
eventually the iconic figure will morph 

1195
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:03,583
into the convenient form to tell the 
story of who is powerful Shakespeare 

1196
01:09:07,671 --> 01:09:09,620
because of the diversity within the 
text,

1197
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:11,780
because of the conflict within the 
stories.

1198
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:14,540
Is that open to now we'll have a woman 
do it.

1199
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:16,650
No,
we'll have someone from Poland do it and

1200
01:09:16,651 --> 01:09:17,151
they will have,
you know,

1201
01:09:17,151 --> 01:09:17,984
like it's,
it's a good way of illustrating what 

1202
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:24,230
power is in how power behaves and built 
into it.

1203
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:28,250
Our invitations for you as an individual
beyond how you,

1204
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:31,970
yourself are contextualized for your 
nationality or age or religion,

1205
01:09:31,971 --> 01:09:32,804
your gender,
find your essential humanity because 

1206
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:36,284
that's another thing that is found fruit
of the diversity of these texts is we 

1207
01:09:39,381 --> 01:09:40,214
all know what jealousy is.
We all know obsession is we all know 

1208
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:44,750
what loneliness is,
heartbreak,

1209
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:46,160
abandonment,
rejection,

1210
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:51,370
and those things supersede transcend,
go around and flood our,

1211
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:55,010
the things we cling to the things we 
cling to in this store.

1212
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:56,490
Absolutely.
Um,

1213
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:01,290
I think it's really great that he began,
um,

1214
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:04,400
to be successful as a poet,
writing the sonnets and so forth.

1215
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:06,523
But it's the plays that everyone thinks 
of because plays are public art and 

1216
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:17,443
performance is a sharing process.
And if you don't mind me embarrassing 

1217
01:10:20,931 --> 01:10:25,730
you when you were working on the 
National Theater Studio Project,

1218
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:27,440
um,
and you did a performance,

1219
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,600
um,
as you've described,

1220
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,633
um,
the,

1221
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:31,910
the,
the,

1222
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:36,710
the high point of it was the end when 
you gave that prospero speech,

1223
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:41,150
which is about the end of things to a 
member of the audience,

1224
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,173
a kid who was sitting there with his 
arms folded most of the time determined 

1225
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:51,270
not to be impressed.
The fact that you passed on the,

1226
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:56,450
the words and the speaking role to him 
was for me,

1227
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:00,283
totally brilliant and totally 
shakespearian because that's the point 

1228
01:11:02,751 --> 01:11:04,070
of it.
It's,

1229
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,990
it's at handing on,
um,

1230
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:09,820
it's a record well that,
that,

1231
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:10,251
that,
that,

1232
01:11:10,251 --> 01:11:12,400
that last speech in the tempest is,
um,

1233
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,330
a prospero says,
um,

1234
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:18,700
if you from par as you from sins would 
pardoned,

1235
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,110
be let your indulgence set me free.

1236
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,473
<Unk>.
So there's this character who can 

1237
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:28,410
control the waves and the wind and meet 
in people's minds.

1238
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,520
You can hypnotize them with a charm.
I'm,

1239
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:33,953
he's only an actor now and he is nothing
and unless we in the audience choose to 

1240
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,210
forgive his weakness,
but why should we do that?

1241
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,253
Because we all need to have our 
weaknesses for given as you from sins 

1242
01:11:50,911 --> 01:11:52,840
would pardon me,
give me a,

1243
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:53,813
give me some applause.
So it's holding that mirror up to 

1244
01:11:57,421 --> 01:11:58,254
nature,
which I could keep on going back to 

1245
01:11:59,761 --> 01:12:02,520
because it's such a wonderful image for 
and culture should do,

1246
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:04,303
um,
hold the mirror at an angle and we see 

1247
01:12:07,441 --> 01:12:08,274
things in a way we are used to hold it 
up straight to our faces and we're 

1248
01:12:11,521 --> 01:12:16,440
forced to see ourselves and that may be 
reassuring.

1249
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:20,490
Um,
but hopefully what's been spoken about,

1250
01:12:20,491 --> 01:12:24,840
what's been acted out in a play like 
Shakespeare and tragedy.

1251
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:29,990
And it's forced us to look that much.
It's forced it to it more closely.

1252
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:34,380
That's beautiful.
Yes.

1253
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:37,740
It presenting us with truth or as close 
to the truth.

1254
01:12:37,741 --> 01:12:42,741
It is plausible for us ever to go with 
me our words as mere humans.

1255
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,260
Tony,
that's a beautiful story.

1256
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:51,480
Thank you very much for sharing your 
experiences with Shakespeare.

1257
01:12:51,481 --> 01:12:52,314
With us today.
We learned more seeing how Shakespeare 

1258
01:12:55,771 --> 01:13:00,771
can be used as a tool for social 
activism as a vessel for history because

1259
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:06,390
they're it because of its the 
multifaceted nature of the work.

1260
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:09,870
There is a kind of alchemy there are 
spelled within it.

1261
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:12,810
Thank you very much for the education.
Appreciate it.

1262
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:14,360
Thank you.
Cheers,

1263
01:13:14,361 --> 01:13:15,194
Danny.
