1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,100
My guests on under the skin today is Dr.
Jordan Peterson.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,203
Clinical psychology is professor of 
psychology at the University of Toronto 

3
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:09,700
and author of books including maps of 
meaning,

4
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:10,534
the architecture of belief.
And He's recent bestseller 12 rules for 

5
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:14,704
life.
First garnering mainstream media 

6
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:21,721
attention in 2016 when he objected to 
compelled speech legislation in Canada.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,290
He has steadily been making a name for 
himself as a voice of the anti political

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,124
correctness movement and has cultivated 
a slew of predominantly young male 

9
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:33,370
followers,
touted by some as an academic rockstar.

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,700
And the most important thinker in the 
west and by others as a provocateur.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,653
And firebrand of the alt right is also 
part of a new Internet savvy group of 

12
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:42,154
controversial thinkers that have been 
deemed the intellectual dark web Jordan 

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,943
Peterson.
And thank you for coming on under the 

14
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:50,410
skin.
Thanks very much for the invitation.

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,483
I,
I'm excited to speak to you because my 

16
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:55,684
interest in your work was either prior 
to or somehow abstract from the 

17
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:05,050
controversies that have brought you to 
mainstream attention.

18
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,213
And I said,
I was thinking then as a clinical 

19
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:11,770
psychologist,
I was wondering about the how,

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,773
uh,
interwoven the relationship between 

21
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:19,390
psychology and,
and mythology and archetypes is,

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,333
well,
one of the things that happened I think 

23
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:22,344
was the,
when the political scandal broke around 

24
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:27,450
me in Canada,
which was in September,

25
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,870
2016 people came to check me out because
of the scandal,

26
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:32,880
but they stayed because of the 
psychology.

27
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,840
By that time I already had about 300 
hours of youtube lectures,

28
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,703
which probably saved me in some sense 
because when I was being protested 

29
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:45,030
against say and worn by the university 
about what I was doing,

30
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,373
because it was hypothetically 
contravening the law people went on my 

31
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:51,810
site to find out what sort of person I 
was.

32
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,644
And I had pretty much everything I'd 
said to students in the last 30 years 

33
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,360
taped and,
and ready for per what public viewing.

34
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,050
My website had already had about a 
million hits then.

35
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:03,884
And um,
people got very interested in the 

36
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:07,914
psychology and it's not surprising to me
because what I've been teaching since 

37
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:16,530
1993 is I think unbelievably practical.

38
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,570
You know,
I'm clinical psychologist so I've always

39
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,690
been interested in trying to improve 
people's mental health.

40
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,020
And I viewed putting the lectures online
as a,

41
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,153
as part and parcel of that.
It's like there were a lot of smart 

42
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:28,494
clinicians in the 20th century.
They learned a lot about how you could 

43
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:33,510
put your life together,
decrease anxiety,

44
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:34,344
decreased depression or in yourself more
effectively in your communication and 

45
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:39,294
with regards to your longterm plans and 
understand your dreams and position 

46
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:43,314
yourself properly in the world.
And it's been a real pleasure and a 

47
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:50,820
privilege to be able to bring that work 
to the broader attention of wealth.

48
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:53,610
Now it's millions of people.
It's not surprising.

49
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:54,271
It helps,
you know,

50
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:56,550
I mean these people were geniuses.
So the fact that,

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,230
talking about what Freud,
Freud,

52
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,580
young Karl Adler,
Carl Rogers,

53
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,414
Abraham Maslow,
there's a slew of existential cycle 

54
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,660
psychologist,
the 1950s humanists in the 1960s.

55
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:09,610
There's,
there's probably a dozen or so,

56
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:10,444
maybe 15 of great clinicians who laid 
the groundwork really for clinical 

57
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:16,210
psychiatry and also for clinical 
psychology.

58
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:17,044
And they and,
and also develop well developed 

59
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:23,350
psychotherapy and therapeutic 
conversations as we know it,

60
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,533
like a emergent myths.
It must bear the inflection of the 

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,810
culture in which it was conceived.
Uh,

62
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,023
this is why I am particularly interested
in the areas of psychiatry and 

63
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:40,730
psychology that are resourced from,
uh,

64
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,490
uh,
older materials such as a methodology in

65
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,990
architecture.
And I know that particularly in,

66
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,690
in the,
some of the names that you mentioned,

67
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,720
mythology I used as a car to a supply,
a common language.

68
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,211
Yeah.
Well,

69
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:56,790
and that's,

70
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,620
that's the right way of looking at it to
some degree.

71
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:02,580
It's like people,
we act out stories.

72
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,410
That's why we tell stories,
right?

73
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,980
That's why people are attracted to 
stories because stories are the best way

74
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:08,814
of describing our lives.
And stories have a pattern or they 

75
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:13,530
wouldn't be stories.
I mean,

76
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:15,180
that's why there's comedy,
right?

77
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,520
That's where everything turns out the 
way everyone wants it too.

78
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,430
That's why there's tragedy when 
everything falls apart.

79
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,150
That's why there's adventure and romance
and that covers a lot of territory,

80
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:24,841
right?
Adventure,

81
00:04:24,841 --> 00:04:25,770
Romance,
comedy,

82
00:04:25,771 --> 00:04:27,900
tragedy,
and you know,

83
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,440
people like Carl Young in particular,
he was,

84
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,340
he was the deepest analyst of stories,
I would say.

85
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,710
Um,
there's a Romanian guy named Murcia,

86
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:38,544
Eliana,
who was also a very historian of 

87
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:44,670
religions who was also very remarkable 
scholar and very useful if,

88
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,970
if you're interested in understanding 
the fundamental patterns of stories.

89
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,710
But young was very interested in the 
deepest structure of stories.

90
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,870
Imagine that humans have languages.
Every human culture has a language,

91
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,780
but languages have a commonality,
right?

92
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,300
They're all languages.
And they have a universal grammar.

93
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:04,134
That was,
that was a noam Chomsky's great 

94
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:07,460
discovery.
Yes.

95
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,300
And stories are like that.
Every culture has its own stories,

96
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:14,130
but the stories have a universal 
grammar.

97
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,170
And so when was the first person who,
who laid the groundwork for,

98
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,123
for,
for discovering what that universal 

99
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,030
grammar was.
And it's crucially important work.

100
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,860
No,
you could say that.

101
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,053
What a religious a religion is.
Is it a religion is a set of stories 

102
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:35,991
that comes very close to the grammar of 
stories so and so there aren't,

103
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,960
they aren't stories that you can 
dispense with hero stories like that

104
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,623
you say did great early work in mapping 
out what might be the etymology or the 

105
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,120
sort of the Lt rhea truth from which 
these patterns emerge?

106
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:55,344
Yep.
Um,

107
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,130
my interest,
this is that it

108
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,963
that cause look either when you're works
with image and Mandela in say for 

109
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:04,274
example,
the red book for it's that what it's 

110
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,333
what is suggested by our ability to 
observe patterns and the fact that we 

111
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:11,864
respond to patterns is that there is 
that there is some kind of universal 

112
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:20,681
frequency that we are responding to.
I had two clients who knew nothing about

113
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,860
union psychotherapy,
both of whom were badly fragmented.

114
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:26,420
They were both women.
They both had,

115
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,030
I would say variants of post traumatic 
stress disorder.

116
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,163
They had other problems as well.
And both of them produced spontaneous 

117
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:37,070
drawings that were first very fragmented
and disorganized.

118
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,880
And then as they put themselves together
and we're ordering themselves,

119
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:41,714
let's say they produce drawings that 
were increasingly symmetrical and 

120
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:47,960
regular and took on the Mandela like 
configurations that young described.

121
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,930
And so that was absolutely fascinating 
to watch that.

122
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,303
And he thought of those patterns as 
manifestations of spontaneous order and 

123
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:59,390
you'll see them in cathedrals.
Yes,

124
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,253
the great rose windows and cathedrals 
are Mandelas and the rose windows and 

125
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:06,440
the entire cathedral structure is 
something like,

126
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,673
it's hard to describe exactly,
but a cathedral is something like the 

127
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:13,850
optimal balance of structure and light.
It's something like that.

128
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,330
And the gothic cathedrals are also 
reminiscent of forests,

129
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:17,961
right?
With their,

130
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:18,794
with their arching branches and the 
light's coming through like the light 

131
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,630
coming through the leaves.
It's reminiscent of that.

132
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:24,464
But there's something about the 
cathedral that expresses the idea of 

133
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,303
perfect structure and there's something 
about a Mandela that expresses that and 

134
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:35,000
something about music that expresses 
that as well.

135
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,193
And it's all,
they're all ways of trying to 

136
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:39,134
symbolically represent how things could 
be if they were put in the proper state 

137
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,180
of balance.
Harmony,

138
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,620
harmony is the right way of thinking 
money.

139
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,370
Harmonies.
I suppose all of these forms,

140
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:53,780
the idea that there could perhaps be 
across the various disciplines,

141
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Straw or informs and expression,
some kind of golden rule seem to infer a

142
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,553
oneness,
a truth that in earlier forms of 

143
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:07,700
language may be expressed as the idea of
God,

144
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,650
wholeness,
oneness.

145
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,240
Uh,
w where the,

146
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,600
what did he stand on the idea,
I do believe in God.

147
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,990
Well,
the union idea is that,

148
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,163
that there's not much distinction 
between what young described as the 

149
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:26,120
archetype of the self and the idea of 
God and the self would be something like

150
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,660
that.
The totality of your being across time,

151
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,650
young thought of Christ as a symbol of 
the self and the reason for that,

152
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:36,230
which is a very profound idea.
It's an amazingly profound idea.

153
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,690
Go and unpack it.
Well,

154
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,210
you can,
if you think about the,

155
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,300
the story of Christ from a psychological
perspective,

156
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:44,910
what,
and,

157
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,743
and you strip it down to its essence,
what you essentially see is that the 

158
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:51,500
story of Christ is the ultimate tragedy.

159
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,693
And the reason for that is that the 
ultimate tragedy is the worst possible 

160
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,480
happening to the best possible person.
Right?

161
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,760
That's the ultimate tragic,
that's what makes it an archetype.

162
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,820
You can't go past that for tragic,
right?

163
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,880
So it's an innocent man who was 
completely sinless,

164
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:07,920
who was working on behalf of,
of,

165
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:13,070
of only the good and the truth.
Broken and destroyed early and young and

166
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,160
betrayed as well.
So that's the ultimate tragedy.

167
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,810
And so then,
and then there's a,

168
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,590
there's a common,
a comedic element to it in the technical

169
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:24,220
sense,
cause a comedy has a happy ending.

170
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,510
Clay wouldn't even require a full in a 
light for the,

171
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,330
for the,
for,

172
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,950
for it to work immediately.
There would need to be a flow in Christ.

173
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,260
Is it that he has God made flesh?
Is that the floor?

174
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,123
Well,
there it depends on what you mean by 

175
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:37,020
comedy.

176
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,853
I mean we,
we tend to as modern people to think of 

177
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,074
comedy as something that's humorous.
But technically if you're looking at 

178
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,690
story structure or comedy is just a 
story that has a happy ending,

179
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,553
right?
That has a positive ending and that 

180
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,053
source,
it's The resurrection story that makes 

181
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:51,720
Christ's story a car,
a comedy.

182
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,850
Tada.
Exactly.

183
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,180
Exactly.
Yeah.

184
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,223
This went so badly wrong.
But there's this possibility of 

185
00:09:57,511 --> 00:10:00,810
resurrection and the way that I read 
that psychologically,

186
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:04,380
and I'm not trying to make any comments 
about the metaphysics of it,

187
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:07,800
is that there's a part of people that's 
the self,

188
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:11,420
the young self,
let's say cap the SLV council as self.

189
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,263
Yes.
That that is capable of sustaining 

190
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:19,380
itself across success of deaths and 
rebirths and everyone really understands

191
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:20,214
this.
It's one of the things that's most fun 

192
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:21,684
to teach people because you know when,
when you're moving through life and you 

193
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:29,250
have a plan or a dream and it shatters,
you know,

194
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,740
someone dies or a relationship breaks 
apart or you,

195
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:36,450
you have a terrible upset in your career
or you become ill in some unexpected way

196
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,530
that everything around you falls apart 
and you plunge into a while,

197
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:43,050
you plunge into a chaotic underbelly of 
the way.

198
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,160
That's exactly right.
Yes,

199
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:46,620
exactly that.
And then you,

200
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:47,454
maybe you stay there because it isn't 
necessarily the case that people get 

201
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:50,491
out.
You know,

202
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:53,190
people die.
People are in despair permanently,

203
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:58,191
but frequently something tragic and 
terrible be false.

204
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:02,790
You and you fall apart and you learn 
something profound as a consequence.

205
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,340
And you put yourself back together and 
when you come back out,

206
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,500
you're more than you were when you went 
in.

207
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,220
And that's happening at a small scale.
Every time you learned something,

208
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,761
you know,
you,

209
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:14,460
if you ever really learned something,
it's usually painful.

210
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,653
It usually means that you have to 
recognize that you're wrong in some 

211
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:18,474
important way.
You have to let that part of you that's 

212
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:21,030
wrong,
die.

213
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,890
And then you have to let a new part of 
you,

214
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,120
okay.
So the self,

215
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,050
imagine that you undergo a series of 
transformations in your life.

216
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,063
There are,
there are collapses into the chaotic 

217
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:34,320
underworld and then red mini 
resurrections that happens continually.

218
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,810
And that's what molds your character is 
his self,

219
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:41,700
is this thing that manages the 
transformations across all those across,

220
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,060
that manages all those transformations.
So you could say,

221
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,193
here's another way of thinking about it.
He could identify with what you 

222
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:51,540
understand.
That's what idiot logs do.

223
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,823
You could identify with you dealt with 
what you don't understand and that's 

224
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:58,450
what sort of seekers after truth,
um,

225
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,100
uh,
identify with,

226
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,750
or you could identify with the process 
of moving between those states.

227
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,460
You know,
sometimes you know what you're doing,

228
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,980
you know where you are,
you,

229
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,830
you're,
you're in control and,

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,300
and,
and you can become arrogant and identify

231
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:15,220
without,
and then become too static about it.

232
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:16,054
Right?
Or you can be in despair and everything 

233
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,900
is chaotic and you all can identify with
that,

234
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:20,734
in which case you're not allistic.
Or you can view yourself as the thing 

235
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,080
that moves across the transformations 
and that's,

236
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,850
that's the right way to,
to,

237
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,953
to conceptualize yourself as you're,
the thing that maintains constancy 

238
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:33,460
across transformations.

239
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,140
One imagines that your experience,
uh,

240
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,260
with the controversies around the,
uh,

241
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,400
linguistics and legislation in Canada 
must have felt like one of those plunges

242
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:50,030
into the depths on some level.
Would you say,

243
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,250
did you,
did you feel a sense of personal tragedy

244
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:57,251
and fear and a concern about consequence
or that there may be no way back that it

245
00:12:57,351 --> 00:12:58,184
could represent a kind of death or did 
it indeed represent a kind of death for 

246
00:13:01,131 --> 00:13:01,964
you,
for one for which you are subsequently 

247
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:03,770
grateful?

248
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,603
Well,
I would say for the first four months 

249
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,083
when the political scandal broke,
it was very unsettling for a variety of 

250
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,624
reasons.
The first was that my occupation as a 

251
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:21,470
clinical psychologist and as a professor
was definitely in doubt.

252
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,633
I mean,
the university sent me two warning 

253
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:26,210
letters and that's standard hr 
procedure.

254
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,370
Usually you get three,
right?

255
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:32,420
The third warning is stop or their 
consequences won't be good.

256
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,910
If you work in human resources,
you have to,

257
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,280
especially if you're going to go after 
someone with tenure,

258
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,150
you have to document their misbehavior.
You have to provide them with warnings.

259
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:43,490
You have to tell them how they could get
back on the right track,

260
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:47,330
and then if you have documented refusal 
to comply with the warnings,

261
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:48,980
then they have grounds for dismissal.

262
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,320
You were close,
you were close.

263
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:52,340
You were close today.
Yeah,

264
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:55,750
to some kind of personal or professional
annihilation or certainly damaged.

265
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,584
Now those for a bit,
just in case on the off chance that 

266
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:00,650
there are people that are unaware of the
d hours.

267
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,770
I'll say it as I understand it and then 
you can tell me I've got it wrong.

268
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,083
The government changed the law say and 
that there are neutral nouns that will 

269
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,700
be mandatorily would be applied to 
people that identify as transgender.

270
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,220
You said that is an imposition on 
freedom of speech.

271
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:19,010
Whilst I would make a decision whether 
or not I would,

272
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:22,640
if I was meeting a transgender person,
I would talk to them how they want it to

273
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:24,980
be talked to.
The fact that you're making it law is an

274
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:27,090
impediment on the freedom of speech and 
then kicked

275
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,491
off.
Yeah,

276
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,140
that's,
that's a,

277
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,470
that's a good summary of it.
Yeah.

278
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,333
I would say,
I mean my sense there were two things 

279
00:14:32,991 --> 00:14:33,824
are objected to.
One was that the government for the 

280
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:37,114
first time in the history of Canada and 
really in a move that was unprecedented 

281
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,850
in English common law under English 
common law actually mandated the content

282
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,713
of voluntary speech and I thought,
I don't care what your excuse is for 

283
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:50,950
doing that.
That's no go zone.

284
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,780
Far as I'm concerned.
That's not happening

285
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,910
even though,
right.

286
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,753
This is what it seems to me like sort of
helped me to understand this one 

287
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,581
because,
well,

288
00:14:57,581 --> 00:15:01,780
I'm always interested in I think is 
power and where power is.

289
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,640
Yeah.
Like you know,

290
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,743
subsequently look what your views are 
towards that sort of poststructuralist 

291
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,780
and the ot left and like a lot of things
I think.

292
00:15:10,781 --> 00:15:11,411
Yeah,
you're right.

293
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:11,981
That though,
you know,

294
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:13,030
I,
I agree with that,

295
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,040
but what,
but what I,

296
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,280
the reason I think that the sort of the 
controversy had fuel on both sides.

297
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,820
The reason it had an engine on the other
side is because it seems that,

298
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,683
uh,
and indeed having watch I've interviews 

299
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,890
and the objections that other 
interviewers have presented to you,

300
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,933
it seems to me that like,
it seems that our transgender person is 

301
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:34,604
in a position of vulnerability,
but you are saying this is not about 

302
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,553
transgender,
this is about language and it's about 

303
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:41,320
oppression.
That's what you're saying.

304
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,000
That was my claim is that this wasn't 
about transgenderism at all.

305
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:45,560
And Yeah,

306
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,390
I'm about mate.
You've got no strong view,

307
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:48,260
I'm guessing or,

308
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,560
um,
I don't,

309
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,960
I don't have the sort of strong view 
that I would,

310
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,663
what,
think I was sufficiently qualified to 

311
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:56,400
make political statements about,

312
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,051
yeah.
Lecture.

313
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:59,020
Kyle goes,
I don't understand it,

314
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:00,710
but she's not my boy,
basically.

315
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:00,850
Yeah.

316
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,500
Look at the research.
You know what I mean?

317
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,020
The research for transgendered kids is 
quite clear,

318
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:07,660
is that most of them deceased by the 
time they're 18,

319
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,500
you know,
and I'm basically guided by,

320
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,433
wait,
does he know Scandinavia where they 

321
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:13,090
check that stuff out?
Yeah,

322
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,830
yeah,
that's right.

323
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,680
That's right.
That's right.

324
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,390
No,
people have criticized that research,

325
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:17,224
like all research,
but it's the best research that's been 

326
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:19,504
done on the topic.
But on the other problem was with the 

327
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:22,294
legislation was that I felt that it was 
an attempt by the radical left to gain 

328
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:32,050
the linguistic territory and to define 
that the terms of the debate,

329
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,771
you know,
and,

330
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:37,020
and I thought that was very dangerous,
so I was objecting to that as well.

331
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,961
Phil,
you never will.

332
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:40,390
The thing that I'm interested in here,
Jordan,

333
00:16:40,391 --> 00:16:45,391
is I don't feel like the radical left is
a very powerful group.

334
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,770
Am I being naive here?
I mean possibly in the world of academia

335
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,903
that I feel like they are sort of 
representative of a coalition bill 

336
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:55,954
around identity politics issues that 
would seem particularly important to 

337
00:16:58,511 --> 00:16:59,344
people.
Like my general view is if you identify 

338
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:02,110
something,
call no problem.

339
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,390
It sounded my business.
That's basically my opinion.

340
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,224
I'll,
I'll call you what you want me to call 

341
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:07,690
you.
I'm happy that you're speaking to me,

342
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,090
but like,
but like,

343
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,280
but like,
but do you see as sort of of the uh,

344
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,143
sort of the sort of extreme left or as a
powerful organization like certainly in 

345
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:19,054
the universities he said,
well they can get what done they could 

346
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,840
for example,
they'll get that legislation passed.

347
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,260
Yes.
That the woman,

348
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,890
I think the situation is different in 
the u s than it is in other countries.

349
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:28,724
I think the political situation in the u
s is actually more balanced than it is 

350
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,870
in most western countries because I 
would say the,

351
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,110
the left,
the radical left has a,

352
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,000
has a pretty decent hold on a number of 
institutions and,

353
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:41,690
and first and foremost of those would be
the universities.

354
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,710
But then the conservatives,
you know,

355
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,540
aren't without power in the United 
States because they occupied most of the

356
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,770
elected positions.
Now do you use it,

357
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,623
but it's not the case in Canada.
You didn't want to be identified with 

358
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:53,670
any of those groups,
am I right?

359
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:54,504
Like you wouldn't say that you're a 
person that's on the right or the left 

360
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:58,410
or conservative or really,
I know she didn't say whether or not you

361
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,420
believed in God.
Well,

362
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:00,254
my political views are complicated 
because I'm temperamentally liberal 

363
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,040
cause I'm pieing openness,
which is a creativity dimension.

364
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,163
People who are high in openness tend to 
be liberal because they liked free 

365
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,770
flowing information and they like,
uh,

366
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,600
what would you say?
Fluid boundaries because information can

367
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,370
move back and forth across the 
boundaries.

368
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,900
So reject like that

369
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,250
ideologically you reject to these 
taxonomies and you identify basically on

370
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:27,070
the bay on the basis of research like 
empiricism.

371
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:29,980
In a sense you could say like you know,
I'm an open minded type of person.

372
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,933
This language is clinical psychology,
so really your faith is clinical 

373
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,683
psychology.

374
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,650
Well I've done a fair bit of research in
my lab on yes,

375
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,523
the temperamental predictors of 
political predisposition and we can 

376
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:43,214
predict what parties people are going to
align themselves with by studying their 

377
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:48,320
personality.
So liberal types,

378
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:49,154
liberal left types are high and the 
trait called openness and open people 

379
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,400
here are very open person and you can 
tell because you think laterally,

380
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,263
you know you have an idea and then it 
reminds you of a whole bunch of other 

381
00:18:58,611 --> 00:18:59,444
ideas and so you'll move laterally 
across ideas and a more conservative 

382
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:05,120
person,
they'll stay within the category,

383
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,710
you know?
And so your,

384
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:10,880
your conversational style is is mark,
bye bye divergences.

385
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,893
That's,
that's actually called divergent 

386
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:13,920
thinking.
It's a hallmark of great,

387
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,843
good.
Well it's good if you want to be 

388
00:19:15,891 --> 00:19:17,610
creative.
The problem with them,

389
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,250
there's a price for everything.
Hey,

390
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,473
the price for creativity is that it's 
hard to catalyze an identity because 

391
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,100
you're interested in everything.

392
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,870
That's the first thing and your 
interest,

393
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:27,704
we'll flip from one thing to another.
So one of the problems that creative 

394
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,124
people have while they have two,
one is they have a hard time 

395
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:33,854
establishing an identity.
And the second is they have a hard time 

396
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:36,794
monetizing their creativity.
It's very difficult to be a creative 

397
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:41,990
person and make money.
You can make money for other people,

398
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,470
but usually your dad by then,
so it's not very helpful for you do it.

399
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,600
And both of those problems,
uh,

400
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,020
as a result of external structures,
the imposition of external structures on

401
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:54,074
the individual iee make money.
That's a problem of capitalism and you 

402
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:00,380
know,
commerce more broadly.

403
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,850
And uh,
the other one of identity similarly,

404
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,050
you know,
so there is,

405
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,040
is there a sort of a peculiar 
contradiction in,

406
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,460
uh,
uh,

407
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,313
around identity in that like it seems to
me on one level that you reject 

408
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,960
taxonomies.
So you're saying that these systems,

409
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:18,794
eeg,
if you say women are being paid less 

410
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:22,130
money,
your argument would be,

411
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,270
well,
hold on a minute.

412
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:26,000
There are other factors other than Jack 
Gender it here.

413
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,560
I exactly agree with the data.

414
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,800
It's a funny thing because the 
intersectional feminists always,

415
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,783
uh,
always claimed that you should take 

416
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:35,040
other factors into account.
Right?

417
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,860
Woman man isn't enough.
Yeah.

418
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,150
Black isn't enough when I say,
well there's a,

419
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:44,010
there's a pay gap between men and women,
but it's not only do due to gender,

420
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,650
it's due to all sorts of things and you 
have to take them into account.

421
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:48,340
So it's an intersection of argument.

422
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,260
So it's quite funny that I get hell for 
it.

423
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,380
He's an intersectional argument.
So unlike,

424
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,440
so do you feel that,
cause what I sent you happening,

425
00:20:58,441 --> 00:21:03,441
like trying to understand where like our
worldviews would align where potentially

426
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:07,630
there would be opposition between you 
and I?

427
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,550
Well,
I'm trying to think cause it seems to be

428
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:10,640
looking at your work,
you said,

429
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,660
oh I don't agree with the way that this 
information is being compiled.

430
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:14,494
I don't agree with the assumptions that 
you're trying to saddle that piece of 

431
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,033
data with.
It seems to me that it's about critical 

432
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,660
thinking and very post structuralist 
idea,

433
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,770
you know?
Um,

434
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,023
but it also,
what I have noticed is that much of 

435
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,683
your,
many of your theories seem to be 

436
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:33,930
subsequently,
uh,

437
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,773
Lloyd to some unpleasant ideas around 
there's sort of tradition and 

438
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:42,580
conservatism,
oppression even.

439
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,530
How do you feel about that?
Cause like,

440
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,330
you know,
like it would be like,

441
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:48,280
it'd be well easy for you to laugh.
I think you have said,

442
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,710
I don't care about whether pete was 
transgender or not.

443
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:52,910
I just don't want no oppressive laws 
around language builders.

444
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:55,450
It'd be easy if you'd say,
I don't think there's any,

445
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:57,070
you know,
I've heard you say on the news,

446
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:58,060
fairness,
fairness,

447
00:21:58,061 --> 00:21:58,894
but it does seem that there was some 
mischief somehow in near around the 

448
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:05,350
issues such as gender inequality,

449
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,160
mischief and me,
Rhonda,

450
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,013
all sorts of things.
But I think that mostly I look at the 

451
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,763
political landscape from the perspective
of a informed biologically oriented 

452
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:16,804
social scientists.
And so when people lay out their 

453
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:21,150
particular theories,
um,

454
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,580
they don't sound,
they don't sound outdated to me.

455
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,540
Like one example is that the left,
for example,

456
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:29,374
tends to lay the blame for inequality at
the feet of the western hierarchical 

457
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:36,460
structure and capitalism.
And that's just wrong.

458
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,410
Equality inequality is a problem and 
it's the proper concern of the left,

459
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:42,244
I would say.
And it's a proper concern because 

460
00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:44,644
inequality is a deadly problem,
but it's way more serious than anything 

461
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:48,394
you can blame on capitalism.
Every single society that's ever been 

462
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:51,814
studied for as far back as people are 
able to study suffers from the problem 

463
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:57,490
with inequality.
This,

464
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,100
I work with this native American tribe 
in,

465
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,750
in,
in northern Vancouver.

466
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:05,380
I'm a member of the tribe actually now 
they're called the [inaudible] people.

467
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,573
And uh,

468
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,483
say that again,
that's not sort of like I have to say 

469
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,520
much qua qua qua qua qua wok.
Oh,

470
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,050
I see.
Yeah.

471
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,820
Tough bear for their native language.
Right.

472
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,243
Tough one to spell cause I would 
probably with me is would say too many 

473
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:18,134
class

474
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,110
then they're brick.
They're,

475
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,003
they're brilliant artists.
They're part of that west coast native 

476
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:24,210
tradition of art,
which I think is a great tradition.

477
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,690
Is that,
um,

478
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,020
well exaggerated eyes.
I want,

479
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,873
it's Hulu.
It's kind of a hallucinogenic art in 

480
00:23:31,051 --> 00:23:32,680
some sense.
And these family,

481
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,250
the animals are very,
are,

482
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,610
are very,
uh,

483
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,950
uh,
graphic.

484
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,823
They're very graphically portrayed,
I would say they have large almond eyes 

485
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:44,610
and bright colors and um,
the arts fared beautiful.

486
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,670
The hideout art is probably the best 
known,

487
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:48,800
very intense.
But the Kwakwaka'Wakw is,

488
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,713
is similar to that.
So they used to have this ceremony 

489
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,233
called the potlatch.
And what you would do in a potlatch is 

490
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,043
usually you have to be comparatively 
wealthy to have a part latch and you 

491
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:01,244
would give away everything you had.
And that was their solution to 

492
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:07,100
inequality because what would happen in 
the native societies,

493
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:07,934
just like every other society,
is that as time progressed everything 

494
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:16,010
would become owned by a very small 
number of people.

495
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,220
And that's a bad recipe for longterm 
stability.

496
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:20,054
So they would have these giant parties 
that would often last weeks where the 

497
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:26,870
rich would demonstrate their wealth.
And also,

498
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:30,530
I suppose their commitment to their own 
provision,

499
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,160
their own capacity to provision the 
future by giving everything away.

500
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,470
But,
and I'm only using that as an example to

501
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:37,304
show that the problem of inequality,
it's not something that you can lay at 

502
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:42,890
the feet of capitalism.
It's a way worse problem than that.

503
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,230
I agree with you and I understand,
uh,

504
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,330
but you're saying that

505
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,223
capitalism occurs far too late down the 
line to be the genesis a problem that's 

506
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:55,210
indigenous to the but what about some of
these like,

507
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:57,720
you know,
and I would be very careful to like the,

508
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,460
you know,
I don't know.

509
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,970
I'm saying I believe in God,
I believe in God,

510
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,043
but like I wouldn't politically,
I would be a little more cautious about 

511
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:06,544
saying why I agree with this pilot boat.
Cause I sort of don't feel that my 

512
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:09,843
political views are demonstrated within 
the sphere of mainstream politics 

513
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:18,530
because they operate on such a 
prohibited frequency because of the,

514
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:19,364
yeah,
the power of Trans National 

515
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,933
Organizations,
the irrelevance of national sovereignty 

516
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:26,260
when it comes to ordinary people 
asserting power.

517
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:26,951
So,
you know,

518
00:25:26,951 --> 00:25:29,350
it becomes sort of kind of too complex 
for me.

519
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,363
But what I can see is interesting about,
so you know even if you take a sort of 

520
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:34,923
socialism and perhaps you know like the,
I suspect or sense that one of the 

521
00:25:38,741 --> 00:25:43,270
issues you take is it sort of continual 
annihilation of likes it take first,

522
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,940
take out God,
then take out man and take out woman,

523
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:50,470
then take out everything to all we have 
is this miasma of meaninglessness.

524
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,730
I wouldn't necessarily put that at the,
well,

525
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,140
I wouldn't necessarily put it in read 
the socialism

526
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,850
per se.
What would you say that is?

527
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,170
Well that's a complicated one.
I mean it happening or did it?

528
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,850
Am I wrong?
I think,

529
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,743
I think it's happened in many ways.
I think a lot of that is a consequence 

530
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:10,540
of the hypothetical conflict between 
science and religion.

531
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,890
Do you think that's hypothetical?
What would be,

532
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:14,740
because I'm not so sure there is a 
conflict.

533
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,723
There will look their materialism and 
spiritual fundamental conflict because 

534
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,760
the world is one thing fundamentally,
right?

535
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:24,850
Everything fits together so there can't 
actually be a conflict.

536
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,000
If the religious realm exists in the 
scientific realm exists,

537
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,120
they have to be unifiable at some point.
Now the more materialistic scientists or

538
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,073
the what the more atheistic scientists 
types like Sam Harris would deny 

539
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:41,290
essentially that there's any validity to
religious dogma.

540
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:44,280
Although he certainly believes that 
there's a element to life.

541
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,420
So I think that what happened,
at least in part,

542
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:52,860
and this is why the work of Yom to 
return to yoga so important is that we,

543
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,740
we weren't,
we didn't understand that truth comes in

544
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,590
different forms depending on its 
application.

545
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,423
It's a tricky thing.
There's the truths that apply when 

546
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:05,814
you're attempting to describe the 
transformations of the material world 

547
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,533
and there's the truths that apply when 
you're trying to determine how it is 

548
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:15,120
that you should act while you're alive.
And those,

549
00:27:15,121 --> 00:27:17,100
obviously those have to come into 
alignment,

550
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,980
but they're not in alignment right now.
And my sense,

551
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:20,814
and this is the sense that's being 
developed at least in part from reading 

552
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:28,110
the great psychoanalysts,
is that fictional accounts,

553
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,220
Mehta,
fictional accounts,

554
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:32,640
even like biblical comps,
which are mythological our stories about

555
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:33,474
how it is that people should act.
Not Stories about what the material 

556
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:37,584
structure of the world is like.
This is also where the fundamentalists 

557
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:41,154
have it wrong as far as I'm concerned.
Because the fundamentalists like to 

558
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:44,604
think that the,
the account in genesis is a scientific 

559
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:48,954
theory.
It can be stacked up against other 

560
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:50,970
scientific theory.

561
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,460
She'll,
they are materializing the mythic.

562
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,300
Yes,
that's right.

563
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,500
And this says I'm helpful.
Well,

564
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:56,281
it's not a help.
Well,

565
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:57,400
first of all,
it's not,

566
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,263
it doesn't even make any sense because 
the materialist types in any real sense 

567
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:05,070
weren't around until about 500 years 
ago.

568
00:28:05,071 --> 00:28:05,904
Right.
And this was all satisfy like cart and 

569
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,690
the cart and,
and uh,

570
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,370
um,
bacon and,

571
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,200
well,
Galileo was another player,

572
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:14,034
but those were the two.
The two major players established the 

573
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:19,380
scientific method.
There weren't scientists before then.

574
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,423
I mean,
there were very intelligent people who 

575
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:23,700
could analyze the structure of the 
world.

576
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:27,120
The ancient Greeks were obviously very 
rational and capable of philosophy,

577
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:29,610
but there was no science until 500 years
ago.

578
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,880
And so obviously the people who wrote 
genesis word scientists,

579
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:35,580
because there weren't any scientists,
so whatever.

580
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,500
And I also think that the,
the world they describe is much more,

581
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,993
it's much better considered the world of
experience than the world of material 

582
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:45,630
reality.

583
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,800
And well,
look here,

584
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:47,870
here's an idea.
You,

585
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,010
you can,
you can try this one on for size.

586
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:52,140
I've been trying this on audiences for 
quite a long time.

587
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:57,170
So modern people say they think the 
world is made out of things,

588
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,830
but if you watch them,
that's not how they act.

589
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,530
They act like the world is made out of 
potential.

590
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,140
And so they'll even say things to each 
other like,

591
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,840
you're not living up to your potential.
You might say,

592
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:10,674
well,
what is this potential that you're 

593
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:13,560
talking about?
You can,

594
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,510
it doesn't have a color.
It doesn't have a shape.

595
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,330
It doesn't have a mass.
It doesn't have a size.

596
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,660
Like there's nothing about it that's,
it has a material,

597
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,183
a material element.
Yet you believe that you're not living 

598
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:29,190
up to your potential.
Everyone feels guilty about that.

599
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:31,620
If someone accuses you,
if that you feel bad about it.

600
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,760
So then I might say,
well,

601
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:35,460
you also live not as if you confront a 
world of things,

602
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:36,294
but as if you confront a world of 
possibility and you hold each other 

603
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:40,770
accountable that way.
Cause I could say,

604
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:41,604
well,
you're not making all the use of the 

605
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:46,120
possibility that's presented to you 
because you're not living,

606
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,590
you're not living.
Honestly.

607
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,573
You're not aiming high enough.
You're not making everything of that 

608
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:54,130
potential that might be made.
It's what's that potential?

609
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,990
Well,
in religious stories,

610
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:56,824
that potential,
and you see this in the first story in 

611
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,044
genesis,
is that potential is what God creates 

612
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:05,110
order out of at the beginning of time.
That's the idea that's expressed in that

613
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:08,530
book is that there's a potential,
whatever that is,

614
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,090
and that something acts on it to bring 
it into reality.

615
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,960
And there's a deeper idea in there too,
which,

616
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,800
which is a profound idea,
which is that the potential,

617
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:23,130
the actuality that you bring out of 
potential with truth is good.

618
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,200
And so there's an ethical element to the
story as well.

619
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,920
And I actually think that that's,
that's a great truth.

620
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:30,754
I do believe that's the case,
that the reality you bring out of 

621
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:36,940
potential with truth is good.
And I think that's one of the most,

622
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,960
that's one of the most profound 
discoveries of humanity.

623
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,823
The ability to articulate that idea was 
articulated in the first chapter in 

624
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:45,874
Genesis to brilliant idea that's 
associated with the idea that human 

625
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:50,164
beings are made in the image of God 
because God is that which calls reality 

626
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:56,644
into being out of potential.
But each of us do that as well in a 

627
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:01,470
small way.
That seems to me to just be true.

628
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,393
Of course,
all the things that are in the manifest 

629
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:05,130
world where once unmanifest,
right,

630
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,353
and many of the things that are 
unmanifest now will become manifest and 

631
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:11,370
we could choose that to some degree.
We have agency.

632
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,810
Well,
we seem to treat each other like

633
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,701
we do.
Yeah,

634
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:15,511
well,
you know,

635
00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:17,490
if I treat you like you don't have 
agency,

636
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,280
you don't like it.
It's not the grounds for a,

637
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,130
for a satisfactory longterm 
relationship.

638
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,063
While we were in the Old Testament,
I want to ask you something because you 

639
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:27,190
want to pick a job that seems right up 
your alley.

640
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,290
I looked at this book,
I can't remember about any more.

641
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:31,180
You may even know specs that you,
you will,

642
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,073
it was a book of engravings from the 
Book of job by the British writer and 

643
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,053
poet William Blake.
Blake had done the series of engravings 

644
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,170
based on the trials and tests that Joe 
went through in these,

645
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:48,080
in these series of engravings.
Yourway and Joe,

646
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:52,570
I,
y'all way and joe are depicted as a sort

647
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:53,710
of identical,
you know,

648
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,544
the ones in a celestial realm once in a 
terrestrial realm and the beginning of 

649
00:31:57,881 --> 00:31:58,714
the image.
But Joe and his family are depicted in 

650
00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:04,180
front of the tree of life,
the instruments hanging in the trees.

651
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:08,110
The animals are sleeping by the end of 
the image after these various trials,

652
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,300
you know,
after Joe has been tested this,

653
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,330
and we were to assume,
I suppose that there's been this journey

654
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,190
of self,
capital s realization.

655
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:15,960
I mean,
uh,

656
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,230
of a,
through these trials,

657
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,100
uh,
the,

658
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,250
the instruments are being played to the 
animals are awake,

659
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:22,810
you know,
and there's a sort of a bright future in

660
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:23,644
this sense of astronomical stuff I 
either position in at the sun and moon 

661
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:28,480
is somehow meant to be significant also.
And the person that wrote this book,

662
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:29,620
he's a union.
Now,

663
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,300
the thing that struck me deep,
deep,

664
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:32,134
deep,
and I've been struggling with it ever 

665
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:34,234
since,
is there's a moment where Yar way shows 

666
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,760
the behemoth and the to job.
And he says,

667
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:45,710
these I made is I made the right.
And then in this union analysis of these

668
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:50,711
engravings,
the writer says that God requires of us,

669
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,940
that we be good,
that goodness itself may exist,

670
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,983
that there is a something beyond,
but it's comparable to neutrality in 

671
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:03,320
God,
the Creator,

672
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:04,790
the idea of God,
the creator,

673
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,013
the image of the behemoth and the 
Leviathan in these engravings is 

674
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:11,230
terrifying.
The animalism of the bacchae empathy,

675
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,400
it's Musculature,
its rawness,

676
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,560
the Leviathan,
sneaky,

677
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:16,400
dark,
deep,

678
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:17,234
terrifying thing.
This idea of agency and got this 

679
00:33:21,261 --> 00:33:22,094
relationship between the unmanifest and 
the manifest as achieved through an 

680
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:26,834
individual's relationship with truth and
expression seemed to me that it was 

681
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:31,754
saying something that was right on the 
precipice of my ability to understand 

682
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:36,890
and sandy to convey.

683
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,960
Okay.
So the first thing I would say as well,

684
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,483
one of the indications that you're open 
is the way that you phrased that 

685
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:44,204
question cause there's like 30 things 
happening in that question all at the 

686
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:47,444
same time.
And one of the things that creative 

687
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:52,550
people do is they throw out like images 
and cause your,

688
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:54,240
your,
your question was full of images.

689
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,093
There's,
you're trying to map territory that you 

690
00:33:56,511 --> 00:33:57,344
don't understand.
You say here's an image and here's an 

691
00:33:58,281 --> 00:33:59,750
image and here's the new bridge and 
here's an image.

692
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:01,700
And there's something uniting all of 
those.

693
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:03,050
But I don't know what it is.
It's like,

694
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,943
well that's what artists do by the way.
And so that's a preliminary mapping of 

695
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:09,800
unexplored territory.
And so we could take that apart a little

696
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:10,580
bit.
I mean,

697
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,413
one of the things,
so joe is objecting to his treatment 

698
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:17,300
because of course God has a bet with the
devil basically,

699
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:19,580
that he can take job down and make them 
curse fate.

700
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,620
He basically bets the devil that he can 
turn job into Kaine and God says,

701
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:25,160
no,
no,

702
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:25,993
you God says no,
you the devil bets God that he can turn 

703
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:32,510
job indicate by tormenting him and God 
says,

704
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:34,340
no jobs a good man.
No matter what you do to him,

705
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:37,560
he won't lose faith in being.
That's essentially the bat.

706
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,920
And you think,
well that's a hell of a thing for God to

707
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:41,000
do.
But then,

708
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,960
and job objects to God to some degree 
and he's got his reasons,

709
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:45,794
man.
I mean cause everything's taken away 

710
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:50,150
from him and God says,
I made these things,

711
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,013
the Leviathan.
So that's like the terrible element of 

712
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,224
nature.
And I made the bay a moth and maybe you 

713
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:57,410
could say that's the terrible element of
society.

714
00:34:57,411 --> 00:34:58,244
It's like how dare you question me?
And that's a perfectly reasonable 

715
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,630
objection.
It's like really?

716
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:04,430
You're good at it doesn't matter what 
happens,

717
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:06,980
you're going to question God really 
well.

718
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,920
So God objects to that and then and then
you,

719
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,810
you,
you,

720
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,853
you will,
although job young believed that job 

721
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,783
actually had the moral upper hand in 
that description because God behaved 

722
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:19,430
rather reprehensive Lee and having a bet
with the devil.

723
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:21,530
I mean young wrote a book called answer 
to job,

724
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:24,920
which is very much worth reading.
It's quite a profound piece of work.

725
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,143
But then you also woven into the 
question this idea of the ethical 

726
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,930
requirement to be good.
Yes,

727
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,990
there's something in that that's 
unutterably deep because this is,

728
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,030
this is right at the limit of my ability
to understand things too.

729
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:39,864
So it's speculative beyond belief,
but it seems to me that we are thrown 

730
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,203
challenges and that they're,
that that in some sense those are best 

731
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:52,230
construed as tests of our ethical 
ability.

732
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,370
So what human thought,
his idea,

733
00:35:54,371 --> 00:35:55,204
it was something like this that at the 
beginning of time people were 

734
00:35:57,601 --> 00:36:02,100
unconscious and that consciousness 
emerge with all of its catastrophes,

735
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:03,960
consciousness of death for example.

736
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,063
And one way out of the burden of 
consciousness was to return to 

737
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,100
unconsciousness.
You can do that with alcohol.

738
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,670
You can do that by being dependent.
You can do that by failing to grow up.

739
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,960
You refuse the burden of consciousness 
by becoming unconscious again.

740
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:23,040
But there's another way for which is to 
become even more conscious.

741
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,150
So the idea would be a little bit of 
consciousness is like an illness,

742
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,240
but if you can expand that consciousness
upwards enough,

743
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:31,074
then it's stumps something.
It starts to become something that it's 

744
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:33,924
all that is its own cure and that partly
what your goal is while you suffer 

745
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:40,164
through life is to heighten your 
consciousness to the point where 

746
00:36:42,091 --> 00:36:42,924
everything gets integrated enough so 
that that's proper medication for the 

747
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:47,394
disease of self consciousness.
And you don't believe that that was 

748
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,113
really the,
that was one of the ideas that ran 

749
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:56,310
through the entire while the entire 
structure of Judeo Christianity,

750
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:59,400
although not it wouldn't be limited to 
Judaeo Christianity.

751
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,473
So it's,
it's more consciousness rather than 

752
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:04,920
less,
it's more attention and I,

753
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,933
I think,
I think there's something to that and 

754
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:08,460
some of that.
See.

755
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,230
The other thing you see in 
psychotherapy,

756
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:11,064
for example,
is that when you're trying to lead 

757
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:14,094
people forward out of the darkness,
let's say out of anxiety and depression 

758
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:18,624
and despair and resentment,
bitterness and anger and all of those 

759
00:37:21,121 --> 00:37:21,954
things,
catastrophic interactions with their 

760
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:25,134
family,
is that you get them to stop avoiding 

761
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,350
confronting the terrible things that are
in front of them,

762
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,060
right?
So basically what you do,

763
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:34,890
instead of saying to them,
you know,

764
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:36,360
all those terrible things that are 
happening,

765
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,160
just ignore those and,
and,

766
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:39,720
and find some peace,
right?

767
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,300
Get your mind away from it.
That isn't what you say you say,

768
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:45,750
turn around and look at them even more 
than you've been looking at them.

769
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:46,723
It was a very paradoxical advice,
but of all the things that have been 

770
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:54,951
proven to aid people's recovery and 
movement towards mental health,

771
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:56,904
that's like at the top of the list,
voluntary confrontation with what you 

772
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,043
are afraid of or,
or what you despise even for that 

773
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:04,410
matter.

774
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,800
And so young had an axiom that he 
derived from the alchemist,

775
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:09,960
which was in stir curliness infinite 
tour,

776
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:10,794
which meant roughly meant that which you
most need will be found where you least 

777
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:17,090
want to look,
which is fun.

778
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,810
Yeah,
well that's hit.

779
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:19,644
I was also his explanation for why 
people weren't enlightened because you 

780
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:23,664
think,
well,

781
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,010
the California approach to enlightenment
to speak,

782
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,873
you know,
kind of satirically is follow your 

783
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:28,980
bliss.
It's like,

784
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,690
well that's easy.
If that was the case,

785
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:33,290
everyone would be enlightened.
But the union approaches,

786
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:33,661
no,
no,

787
00:38:33,661 --> 00:38:34,494
no.
You do what's meaningful and pay 

788
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:38,380
attention,
follow the truth and it will take you to

789
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:39,214
the worst place you can imagine.
And then maybe there's some chance for 

790
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:42,754
enlightenment.

791
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,140
Campbell somewhat revoked that,
uh,

792
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,140
I follow your bliss,
uh,

793
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,220
mantra though by saying he wish he'd 
said follow your blisters.

794
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,640
You know,
like one of these,

795
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,610
the pain.
Yeah.

796
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,920
Yeah.
I didn't know he said that.

797
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:56,361
Yeah.
It's cool,

798
00:38:56,361 --> 00:38:57,020
isn't it?
Yeah.

799
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,980
The kids pull out on the scoreboard.
That's good.

800
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,210
That's like a novel thing.
Oh,

801
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,093
now I've been framed because you've said
that I said something that you didn't 

802
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:05,694
know.
And it's unraveled my entire veltin 

803
00:39:07,651 --> 00:39:09,690
shower.
And now I've reached for a bit of German

804
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:11,640
language to pull my way back in.
Oh yeah.

805
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,080
Heard and Melville,
he'll help me out.

806
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,570
Like so like a,
I'm reading this moby Dick,

807
00:39:15,571 --> 00:39:17,190
it smashed my head up,
you know,

808
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:18,030
like,
and like,

809
00:39:18,031 --> 00:39:20,820
um,
when he says in the,

810
00:39:20,821 --> 00:39:22,920
there's a,
towards the end of the book I have,

811
00:39:22,921 --> 00:39:25,280
when he's hanging out with pip and 
stuff,

812
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:26,970
he's,
and he's really losing it now,

813
00:39:26,971 --> 00:39:29,770
but maybe he's finding it too.
It is a bit weak.

814
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,820
He talks about will,
who is it that move this arm?

815
00:39:32,821 --> 00:39:35,070
He says,
who is it that think disease thoughts?

816
00:39:35,071 --> 00:39:38,520
If the mighty son has no control over 
its movements,

817
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,340
what control is Ahab over his thoughts?
You know,

818
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,340
in talking about fate and destiny and 
these ideas,

819
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,830
again,
seemed to me very potent,

820
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,680
powerful themes.
My,

821
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,543
the petitioner

822
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,010
with a great whale.
Right?

823
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,840
And that's,
that's the dragon of the abyss.

824
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,040
That's,
that's Moby Dick.

825
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:55,874
Cause it's,
it's the hero against the dragon of the 

826
00:39:57,651 --> 00:39:59,540
abyss.
And he's obsessed with it.

827
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:00,301
Right?
Well,

828
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:01,710
he shouldn't be obsessed with it.
It's,

829
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,553
it's,
it's what to be obsessed with is the 

830
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:04,694
dragon of the abyss.
That's the oldest story of mankind is 

831
00:40:07,581 --> 00:40:09,980
that your proper obsession is the dragon
of the abyss.

832
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,060
That's where the gold is.

833
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,020
Yes.
That's where the gold is.

834
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,120
Even though that's where things are most
terrified,

835
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,193
bloody tragic ending,
except that you take Ishmael is the 

836
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:19,860
protagonist,
in which case you should mount survives.

837
00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:21,030
And I have,
you know,

838
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,360
done a ruin it for anyone dice.
Um,

839
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,530
but like I,
so it's a tragedy.

840
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:27,780
It's a tragic encounter with the dragon 
of chaos.

841
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,820
He's a failed hero.
Fundamental outcomes.

842
00:40:29,821 --> 00:40:31,360
He's a,
and he's gay.

843
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,180
Lost that limb and stuff and I'm sure,
yeah,

844
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,014
sort of a symbolic,
just like Captain Hook and the 

845
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,350
crocodile,
he had a half the ha.

846
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,100
Yeah.
I love,

847
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,140
for me it's very exciting when I see 
these patterns of preventing Elysium.

848
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:45,480
For me it is exciting because this tree,
it's the implicit energy and implicit in

849
00:40:45,481 --> 00:40:47,190
his truth.
And now that thing we were talking about

850
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:48,024
a minute ago where we were,
I got excited because I said fully your 

851
00:40:49,671 --> 00:40:51,420
blisters,
the field's going to say is like that.

852
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,320
So some sort of maximize understand in 
Buddhism of like let it burn,

853
00:40:55,321 --> 00:40:58,020
let it burn and burn,
like take away from me everything.

854
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:58,880
Right?
Right.

855
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,130
Oh there's the idea is also

856
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,210
there in Christianity,
so there's no cult interpretation.

857
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,750
There's letters on Christ's cross Inri 
Jesus Christ.

858
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,240
It means Jesus Christ,
King of the Jews.

859
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:10,074
And it was put there by the Romans.
But there's no cult interpretation in 

860
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:14,700
Latin,
which I can re re reproduced,

861
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,520
but it means through fire,
all things are renewed.

862
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,820
And one of the,
one of the deepest ideas of Christianity

863
00:41:20,821 --> 00:41:21,654
is that you should burn everything off.
That's part of you that isn't part of 

864
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:25,914
that thing that can die and be reborn.
Like there's all sorts of baggage that 

865
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,930
people say that there's baggage that 
you're carrying.

866
00:41:30,931 --> 00:41:33,860
Everyone knows that it's deadwood.
It's like that to burn off.

867
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,710
And that's a lot of,
that's way more of you than you think.

868
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,210
She was.
Way More than you think.

869
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,790
Whilst you still haven't said whether or
not you believe in God,

870
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,490
and I won't keep going on about it 
because I'm not one of them.

871
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:45,500
People see what the means to do that.

872
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,550
So let,
I'm like,

873
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:48,803
it seems to me that you revere truth at,
it seems to me that you are interested 

874
00:41:54,451 --> 00:41:55,284
in the truth in scripture and mythology.
Now then what this leads me to is 

875
00:42:00,061 --> 00:42:00,894
something we've touched upon briefly.
It's about the role of power and the 

876
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,250
function of morality and ethics and,
and,

877
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:09,084
and,
and indeed simpler ideas that will have 

878
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:14,070
terms if not ideas such as compassion 
and goodness.

879
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,320
So when like,
you know,

880
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,183
it's interesting to me that you've 
written sort of an accessible sort of 

881
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:20,760
self help type book that,
you know,

882
00:42:20,761 --> 00:42:22,200
clean your room,
stand up straight,

883
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:23,540
stick your shoulders back,
stuff that,

884
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,710
you know,
like I would not query there.

885
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,340
The only thing that I feel like I would 
like to ask you about because my,

886
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:31,230
I don't know if I even have a 
constituency,

887
00:42:31,231 --> 00:42:32,190
but the people,
I find that,

888
00:42:32,191 --> 00:42:33,024
you know,
I find myself talking a lot to Muslim 

889
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:35,880
people,
uh,

890
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,520
young women's self harming,
eating disorders,

891
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:40,360
these kind of clinical psychology.

892
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,193
So I imagine you have more and more 
access to that kind of information and 

893
00:42:43,621 --> 00:42:44,454
those kinds of experiences than I do.
I have this strong feeling that I am 

894
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:51,060
supposed to make myself available for 
the vulnerable,

895
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,470
for the powerless and for the voiceless.
So that's a fine idea.

896
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,040
This is the one,
it's how do you do it?

897
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:01,020
How do huge bloody question.
Sometimes they don't want me interfering

898
00:43:01,021 --> 00:43:03,690
in their lives majority of the time.
Right.

899
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,430
There certainly is that while there's 
an,

900
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:09,480
there's a maxim that's often applied by 
people who work in old age homes,

901
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,020
which is never do anything for the 
residents that they can do themselves.

902
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,790
They can't still their own money and 
they're sleeping.

903
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:19,760
Bobbie,
I'm a Canadian comedian.

904
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,680
Very funny that it was,
I think something that has paid off over

905
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:25,280
the long run.
Yeah.

906
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,650
Now,
so isn't it?

907
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,220
So it's hard.
Like the thing about,

908
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,820
the thing about compassion is it's not 
sufficient to produce solutions.

909
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,420
Compassion is an unbelievably useful 
emotion if you're dealing with six month

910
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:38,790
old infants,
they're always right.

911
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,930
She's there and also now,
but like a,

912
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,760
you know what?
I was taught very

913
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,660
well.
You said it doesn't work.

914
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:46,980
What

915
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,900
about what want to say is like,
I know you said no,

916
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,970
this thing about sort of good,
but one of the,

917
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:59,060
as a one off the essential themes,
ideas about the Christ myth being,

918
00:43:59,251 --> 00:44:00,084
you know,
sort of burn away all that cannot be 

919
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:05,370
reborn but bloody hell mate in the 
actual language,

920
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,220
all he bangs on about is kindness,
kindness,

921
00:44:08,221 --> 00:44:09,031
love,
love,

922
00:44:09,031 --> 00:44:09,900
kindness,
kindness,

923
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:11,330
love,
revelation.

924
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,840
Not In revelation.
He's a judge in revelation.

925
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,190
What and are you still,
you're still taking that is what's books

926
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,053
beyond the gospels,
you're still taking as the word of 

927
00:44:19,111 --> 00:44:20,430
Christ.
Well,

928
00:44:20,431 --> 00:44:23,250
I'm taking them as part of the entire 
Corpus of the story.

929
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,353
I mean the reason that you thought 
revelation was appended to the Bible is 

930
00:44:26,821 --> 00:44:27,654
because the Christ in the gospels was 
aired two s too much in sense on the 

931
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:34,080
side of mercy and not enough on the side
of judgment.

932
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:38,170
Because here's the technical,
there's a technical reason.

933
00:44:38,171 --> 00:44:40,350
You know,
it's like we've got one attachment.

934
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:41,400
Oh Jesus.
Well,

935
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:44,310
you don't have a choice because if you 
have an ideal,

936
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:45,144
it's a judge.
Like you have an ideal and there might 

937
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:48,144
be an ideal that you have a view.
It's simultaneously your judge because 

938
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:51,744
you fall short of it.
I understand this cause that's funny 

939
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:54,834
enough,
I was talking to the fellow that taught 

940
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:56,940
me meditation yesterday,
Bob Roth.

941
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:59,280
So he's a student of the Maharishi.
You know that.

942
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,420
He said that when Maharishi was asked 
what is the one principal,

943
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,313
the one principal,
he didn't say kindness or compassion or 

944
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:06,804
anything like that.
He said,

945
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,060
discernment,
discernment,

946
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:11,740
and which path are we going to follow?
Their attention,

947
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,500
guarding,
but judgment.

948
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,423
That's why in revelation Christ divides 
the damned from the saved and most of 

949
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:19,224
the damned bitch discernment.
And what that means in some sense is 

950
00:45:21,941 --> 00:45:24,420
that there's a thousand,
there's 100,000

951
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:27,030
ways to do things wrong and only one way
to do them right.

952
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,040
Or maybe only five ways of doing them 
right.

953
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,620
But you know that in your own life is 
that the,

954
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,513
the,
the,

955
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,473
there's an infinite number of snares 
that you can tangle yourself up in and 

956
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:39,270
to find that pathway where everything is
balanced,

957
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,133
that's very,
that requires continual discernment at 

958
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:43,280
attention.
And so you,

959
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,800
you can't have an ideal without it being
a judge and you can't,

960
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,230
you can't live property without 
discernment.

961
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:53,040
But that doesn't mean compassion and 
compassion isn't relevant.

962
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:53,874
It doesn't mean that at all.
A guy ask you something that sort of 

963
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:56,940
occurs to me.
See,

964
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,230
like,
I like you,

965
00:45:58,231 --> 00:46:01,650
I found myself in different types of 
controversial situations,

966
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:05,220
various conflict and many,
much of the time is because,

967
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,720
uh,
like Albert maysles said,

968
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,270
tyranny is the deliberate removal of 
nuance.

969
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,660
People remember,
I didn't even say that.

970
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,170
That's a good phrase.
It's good shit,

971
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:14,004
isn't it?

972
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,610
But like the thing,
right?

973
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,640
Deliberate removal of a new audience.
Yeah,

974
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,513
that's,
that's what makes it different than 

975
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:23,910
ignorance because ignorance,
there's no nuance and ignorance,

976
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:26,010
but it's excusable because you just 
don't know any better.

977
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,350
But when it's deliberate,
that's a whole different story.

978
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,313
It's very nice.
Who said the album mays was filmmaker 

979
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,520
who made like grey gardens.
He made that be,

980
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:35,340
I did a documentary with him very 
briefly and he uh,

981
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,430
he made that Beatles movie when the 
Beatles first came to the states.

982
00:46:38,431 --> 00:46:41,700
He made gimme shelter as the maze was 
probably that I like old guys now.

983
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:42,810
Brilliant Documentarian,
uneasy.

984
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:43,644
I'm crew here and nodding the approval.
He invented much of the fly on the wall 

985
00:46:46,621 --> 00:46:50,340
verite style that's informed subsequent 
documentary tyrannies that deliver it.

986
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:51,174
Removal of nuance.
I worked with him sort of briefly 

987
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:55,710
filming none other than President Donald
Trump of all people.

988
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,310
But like one of the things that I wanted
to talk about was,

989
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:02,130
um,
if I like this is the thing,

990
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,200
I don't like all of the,
I don't like the,

991
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:06,920
I agree and I or I feel,
I don't know what you feel that,

992
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:07,840
that you know,
that one of the,

993
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,823
the,
the neo liberalism abandoned its 

994
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:12,144
allegiance to and leftist politics.
It has in a sense abandoned the working 

995
00:47:15,151 --> 00:47:18,690
class and I can understand their rage 
and,

996
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,900
but the feeling I personally have is 
when,

997
00:47:21,901 --> 00:47:22,734
if I sense that I'd said things and I've
done this so I know that have offended 

998
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:26,341
women,
which I,

999
00:47:26,341 --> 00:47:27,480
you know,
when I was more,

1000
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:29,040
when I was a single person that was 
promiscuous,

1001
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:33,040
I know that that course be comfort,
aggression and conflict.

1002
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,530
Or when I've done things like,
you know,

1003
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:37,420
in the spirit,
a few mother of cat,

1004
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:39,040
like a kickback.

1005
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,170
I've always felt bad.
If I feel like I've offended people,

1006
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:47,500
the I would,
I would regard or culturally or regarded

1007
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:48,700
as vulnerable.
Yup.

1008
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,730
So like around the,
uh,

1009
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,613
like I,
when we make the conversation about the 

1010
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,560
use of language,
tyranny and oppression in free speech,

1011
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,270
you know,
obviously I agree with you,

1012
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:01,810
but the,
but I do take from,

1013
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,990
you know,
the Gospel version of Christ,

1014
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,840
the idea that kindness,
love,

1015
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:08,943
we can't,
we have to continue to find resources 

1016
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:13,084
for ongoing,
you know,

1017
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,490
I will continue to fail,
but we must continue to be loving.

1018
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,200
So I'm,
my question is,

1019
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:18,034
is if you are found herself in a 
position where I kind of think some 

1020
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:21,124
people were using you to sort of say 
fuck you women or fucking you 

1021
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:29,310
transgender people.
And for me I think I would want to still

1022
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:31,690
go on.
That's not my bag.

1023
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,020
So where do you stand on that?

1024
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,230
Well,
I think,

1025
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:37,063
I think that,
first of all we'll go to the most 

1026
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:42,170
fundamental part of the question,
which is this issue about love.

1027
00:48:42,171 --> 00:48:43,004
Then like one of the things I've thought
about a fair bit is the meaning of the 

1028
00:48:48,951 --> 00:48:51,830
sermon on the mount.
And as far as I can tell,

1029
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,150
it's,
it's a,

1030
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,780
it's basically a two part.
It's two part wisdom.

1031
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,040
The first is that you should aim at the 
highest good that you can imagine.

1032
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,950
And that would be a good,
that includes everyone,

1033
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:06,650
right?
So if I wanted what was good for you,

1034
00:49:06,651 --> 00:49:07,484
say if I genuinely wanted it,
I wanted in a way that was good for you 

1035
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,473
now and good in the long run and good 
for you and your family and your 

1036
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,770
community.
And maybe good for me too.

1037
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,633
You know,
we could conceive of that as the desire 

1038
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:22,100
and I think that's a good definition of 
love is that you actually want the best,

1039
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:24,140
you want the best possible outcome.

1040
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,440
And in the Gospels of course that's 
extended even to your enemies.

1041
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,101
Yes,
right?

1042
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:29,960
Is that okay if we're going to have 
things good,

1043
00:49:29,961 --> 00:49:30,794
let's have a good enough for even the 
people that set themselves up against 

1044
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:34,484
me.
Because if the world was running 

1045
00:49:35,511 --> 00:49:36,344
property,
things would be good for them too and 

1046
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:38,894
that would be better.
And it seems to me that that's a very 

1047
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:41,414
good way of looking at things.
It's a difficult way of looking at 

1048
00:49:43,011 --> 00:49:43,844
things.
And then the second part of the sermon 

1049
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:49,910
on the mount is something like having 
established that as your aim,

1050
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,530
which is no easy thing by the way,
right?

1051
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,364
Because you have to be pretty clear 
headed and single minded to actually 

1052
00:49:55,401 --> 00:49:56,234
want that to be rain.
Then you can concentrate on the day and 

1053
00:49:59,421 --> 00:50:02,120
you can try telling the truth and you 
can ally.

1054
00:50:02,121 --> 00:50:04,550
So there's truth and love that are 
allied together.

1055
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:05,870
Truth,
love and attention.

1056
00:50:05,871 --> 00:50:08,000
It's something like that that are all 
allied together.

1057
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:09,283
Um,
with regards to transgressing against 

1058
00:50:11,691 --> 00:50:12,524
the vulnerable.
I don't think that that is what I've 

1059
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:17,120
done.
I think that people have claimed that,

1060
00:50:17,121 --> 00:50:18,830
but I don't think there's any evidence 
for it.

1061
00:50:18,831 --> 00:50:19,611
I mean,
first of all,

1062
00:50:19,611 --> 00:50:24,611
I know absolutely that I have brought 
perhaps thousands of people,

1063
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,253
maybe tens of thousands of people,
but certainly thousands of people away 

1064
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,773
from identification with the right cause
they write me all the time and tell me 

1065
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:34,644
that I've received about 30,000
letters specifically from people who've 

1066
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:42,000
been watching my youtube videos since 
August and 25,000

1067
00:50:42,001 --> 00:50:42,834
of them are.
So we've tried to count are from people 

1068
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:45,624
who said that they were in very dark 
places and that their lives are much 

1069
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,793
better,
much oriented towards truth and 

1070
00:50:51,871 --> 00:50:54,660
responsibility and a wave from political
ideology,

1071
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,160
mostly on the right.
Right.

1072
00:50:56,161 --> 00:50:57,390
That they were attracted on the right.

1073
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:58,980
Because I have more people like that.
Right.

1074
00:50:58,981 --> 00:50:59,814
Me Than people who say that I say 
rescued them from the hell holes of the 

1075
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,160
radical left.
Um,

1076
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:10,310
I think that's more of a historical 
accident and some in some in some whites

1077
00:51:11,131 --> 00:51:12,330
than,
than anything else.

1078
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:15,540
And but also with the transgender issue 
and more specifically,

1079
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:20,460
I've received now at least 40 letters 
from transgender people and the only one

1080
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:22,830
of them was critical and it wasn't that 
critical.

1081
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,760
The rest of them all said,
um,

1082
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,400
we never signed up to be poster boy of 
the year for the radical left.

1083
00:51:29,401 --> 00:51:30,090
And it's,
no,

1084
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,280
it's been no picnic.
Believe me.

1085
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:35,310
All that's happened is that our lives 
have become much more difficult.

1086
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:39,650
And I believe that and I don't see that.
I think one of the mistakes that the,

1087
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,513
the radical left makes,
and this is part and parcel of their 

1088
00:51:42,631 --> 00:51:47,370
flirtation with identity politics,
is that they fall all over themselves to

1089
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:51,000
believe that if a person identifies as a
minority,

1090
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,480
then they immediately have the right to 
speak for all the people who are in that

1091
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:55,314
minority.
And that's a claim that I reject 

1092
00:51:57,451 --> 00:51:58,800
completely.
I mean,

1093
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:01,740
first of all,
there is no transgender community.

1094
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:02,723
It's not a community because the 
community is constantly interacting and 

1095
00:52:05,311 --> 00:52:06,144
networking and has a shared purpose.
And old out transgender people are just 

1096
00:52:08,911 --> 00:52:11,130
as diverse as any other people.
It's like saying,

1097
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:13,380
well there's,
there's no real black community,

1098
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:16,860
there's not homogenous political 
viewpoints across the black population.

1099
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,820
I,
I agree to appoint the,

1100
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:20,663
these taxonomies are necessarily 
externally imposed because how would 

1101
00:52:24,691 --> 00:52:27,780
they be intrinsically experienced?
I understand that.

1102
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,033
But also it seems to me that there is a 
thing called the experience of being an 

1103
00:52:33,721 --> 00:52:34,554
African American and you can put into 
that high prison populations for young 

1104
00:52:38,701 --> 00:52:39,534
males,
lack of educational opportunity or work 

1105
00:52:43,051 --> 00:52:46,410
opportunity that day is available for 
that.

1106
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:51,390
So while community may be an incorrect 
term,

1107
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,433
literally there is this,
there was a straw that seem to be 

1108
00:52:55,021 --> 00:52:56,850
underserved.
And another concern I would have about,

1109
00:52:56,851 --> 00:52:59,960
so some of the war,
the re-purposing,

1110
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:00,893
you know,
as far as far as we know so far or have 

1111
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:03,863
much of your arbitrary on online work 
seems to me that it supports the 

1112
00:53:09,601 --> 00:53:12,540
powerful is a ports hedge money.
I would,

1113
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:15,350
I don't agree that things are as simple 
as white men.

1114
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,070
Our ability to pat and let you know that
you know,

1115
00:53:17,071 --> 00:53:17,904
like,
but I'm only interested in who is able 

1116
00:53:20,521 --> 00:53:21,450
to effect change.

1117
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:24,630
Who is able to influence,
who can you not attack in public?

1118
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,880
What is possibly like,
who is being controlled?

1119
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:30,750
That's what interests me.
So like in a transnational corporations,

1120
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,190
economic elites,
you know,

1121
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:33,024
like sort of,
and how are they serve by what I say or 

1122
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:37,140
by what you say.
Okay.

1123
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:39,750
So that,
that's a reference back to the existence

1124
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:40,584
of inequality.
We agreed or inequality back to that 

1125
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:43,683
problem.
Oh yeah,

1126
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:44,940
yeah.
You're saying it's natural,

1127
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:45,774
which clearly it's not.
You cannot leave it at the feet of 

1128
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:49,230
capitalism.
That's absolutely clear.

1129
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,520
That and the fact that it's naturally 
though capitalism,

1130
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:54,870
what's that?
Capitalism doesn't help.

1131
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,700
There's so many,
like in a Marxist critique,

1132
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:57,534
what I understand that it is that 
capitalism is built on limitless growth 

1133
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,510
from finite,
from finite resources.

1134
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:04,403
And also capitalism will always,
always be redirected and criminally 

1135
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:09,174
misused.
And,

1136
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,670
and they're sort of the economics of our
time.

1137
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,740
It sort of for me is demonstrable.
I know stuff.

1138
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:14,760
There are people that say,
oh no,

1139
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:17,010
people are richer now than ever,
but like,

1140
00:54:17,011 --> 00:54:17,844
you know,
staying in La for a while and there's 

1141
00:54:18,811 --> 00:54:22,290
90,000
homeless people in the Greater La area,

1142
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:25,170
it seems like some sort of like the 
apocalypse is creeping in.

1143
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,150
People are richer than they ever have 
been,

1144
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:29,880
but the extreme extremes of inequality 
are high too.

1145
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,700
And there's some evidence that there's 
some evidence.

1146
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:33,563
Well here,
here's an example of how these things 

1147
00:54:34,591 --> 00:54:36,690
might work.
So imagine that people,

1148
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,600
that people are getting richer,
there's absolutely no doubt about that.

1149
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,800
But here's,
here's what we got.

1150
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:42,100
More stuff.
Even though like,

1151
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,610
I'm sure you would agree that carving,
that's what starving,

1152
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:46,920
that's good.
Obesity is a bigger problem in the world

1153
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:49,050
now than starvation.
That's a big deal.

1154
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:52,230
That's a big plus.
But here's the way it still implies that

1155
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:56,280
people are being underserved by the sea,
by their operating systems.

1156
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:57,750
Oh,
but there's no doubt about that.

1157
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,870
And it's still in first inequality also.
Well,

1158
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:01,763
first of all,
there's no doubt that any social system 

1159
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:07,530
has a tyrannical and arbitrary aspect.
I mean,

1160
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,350
that's an architectural training,
right?

1161
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,140
Any of course.
And even now,

1162
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,830
even well functioning systems have a 
tyrannical aspect.

1163
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,263
Not mostly,
or at least merely because they're more 

1164
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,280
native Americans.
Who your gown.

1165
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:22,123
We've not native Americans,
native Canadians that the Kwakwaka'wakw 

1166
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:29,250
then guys like how's their social system
set up?

1167
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,870
Oh it's a catastrophe.
Go on.

1168
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:34,620
Oh well I mean it's a catastrophe for 
all sorts of reasons.

1169
00:55:34,621 --> 00:55:36,050
I mean some of it's true.
Yeah,

1170
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:36,893
it is.
It is.

1171
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:38,323
The situation is very catastrophic.
But you mainly because well the reserve 

1172
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:41,964
system was set up in Canada and it had a
possibility of working when there was a 

1173
00:55:45,691 --> 00:55:48,780
possibility that small communities could
work economically.

1174
00:55:48,781 --> 00:55:51,420
But small communities don't work 
economically anymore.

1175
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,350
Like if you go through Saskatchewan for,
for example,

1176
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:58,860
or central province in Canada in the 
1960s there were thousands and thousands

1177
00:55:58,861 --> 00:56:00,900
of small towns,
mostly Caucasian.

1178
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,950
That is because of their dots.
Capitalism.

1179
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,080
No,
no it's not.

1180
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:05,400
It's,
it's deeper than that.

1181
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:06,870
It's the same prop.
Well here's,

1182
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:09,600
it might be deeper than it,
but in its current form it is company.

1183
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:10,434
Cause I would agree that,
what is capitalism a manifestation of 

1184
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:14,420
greed?
Well,

1185
00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:15,460
you could say,
well,

1186
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,120
it's the same thing that,
but the same thing has happened all over

1187
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:18,954
the world.
Like urbanization is taking places a 

1188
00:56:20,731 --> 00:56:23,500
tremendously rapid rate.
It doesn't matter what the culture is or

1189
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:24,430
the form of government.

1190
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,670
So you think that the politics is 
happening at a lower level.

1191
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,950
The phenomenology,
that's where the,

1192
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,300
where the significant is.
Ha Ha is a bigger time.

1193
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:34,403
And within it,
political systems are just learning 

1194
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:36,750
about.
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't.

1195
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,580
That's man.
All the ones we have in search a fairer,

1196
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,010
more just better ones.
If typically,

1197
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:47,011
if they are empirically not working,
come up with a way to reliably flattened

1198
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,290
inequality,
that would be a good thing.

1199
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,240
But the empirical evidence suggests so 
there's a bunch of things it suggests.

1200
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:56,370
First of all,
if you look at the,

1201
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,760
at the attempts to alleviate inequality 
over the last 200 years,

1202
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,633
whether there were left wing governments
in power or right when governments are 

1203
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:10,270
made absolutely no difference whatsoever
to the degree of inequality,

1204
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,433
the only things that have been reliably 
demonstrated to flatten out inequality 

1205
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,780
are catastrophes,
wars,

1206
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,670
revolutions,
epidemics.

1207
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,833
Um,
there's one other war revolution 

1208
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:23,140
epidemics.
Well,

1209
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:25,240
it's going to be some kind of holsman 
now.

1210
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:26,080
Yeah,
it starts right.

1211
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,060
It's another horsemen,
and I can't remember which it is,

1212
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:28,894
but,
but at a price of the price of radical 

1213
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,380
redistribution seems to death.
Yeah.

1214
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:38,770
There and no one has come up with these 
things because of how power functions.

1215
00:57:38,771 --> 00:57:41,920
Because like in a row,
in an unequal system,

1216
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:44,380
whilst there are many people that are 
suffering,

1217
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:46,060
there are some people that are 
benefiting.

1218
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:49,900
I'm in a tear that benefit from their 
current economic situation.

1219
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:51,820
Um,
I drive a nice car.

1220
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:53,590
I have nice house.
I go where I want.

1221
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:54,910
Well,
let's look at that for a minute.

1222
00:57:54,911 --> 00:57:55,744
Like,
if you think about how that happened in 

1223
00:57:56,771 --> 00:57:58,510
your life,
I bet I can tell you how it happened.

1224
00:57:58,900 --> 00:57:59,790
Well,
I mean,

1225
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:02,530
if this isn't a personal account,
but Bennett Bay,

1226
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:06,700
you hadn't assessed in one dimension,
right?

1227
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:07,623
High success,
but because you were successful in that 

1228
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:09,814
dimension,
all sorts of opportunities came your 

1229
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:13,180
way.
Like my suspicions are that where you're

1230
00:58:13,181 --> 00:58:15,640
sitting now,
you have more opportunities than you can

1231
00:58:15,641 --> 00:58:17,920
deal with it.
Is that correct?

1232
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:18,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

1233
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,110
Right,
right.

1234
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:20,944
Exactly.
Well,

1235
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:21,461
the,
see,

1236
00:58:21,461 --> 00:58:22,294
this is part of what seems to drive 
inequality is that as you get 

1237
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,984
successful,
the opportunities that come your way 

1238
00:58:28,661 --> 00:58:31,000
start to multiply and they don't 
multiply linearly.

1239
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:34,330
They multiply exponentially.
And so when you start moving up,

1240
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,730
you start moving up faster and faster 
and faster and faster,

1241
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:37,773
and then you'll hit a point where you 
have so many opportunities that you 

1242
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:42,760
don't even know what to do with it.
And so it's a nonlinear improvement.

1243
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,160
But the,
the,

1244
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:48,370
the downside of that is you might've had
periods in your life that were like this

1245
00:58:48,371 --> 00:58:49,204
too,
where let's say you start to get 

1246
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:51,484
depressed and then you start to drink 
because you're depressed and then you 

1247
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:54,964
start to isolate yourself because you're
drinking and you're depressed and 

1248
00:58:56,891 --> 00:58:59,560
because you're drunk and depressed,
then your friends start to abandoned you

1249
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,880
and then you lose your job.

1250
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,760
It's like you're not going downhill in a
straight line.

1251
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:07,780
You're going downhill faster and faster 
and faster until you fall off a cliff.

1252
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:11,070
And that seems to be how the world works
is like there's a center point,

1253
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:13,570
it's unstable,
things improve,

1254
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,433
then they improve exponentially and 
things fall and then they fall off 

1255
00:59:16,571 --> 00:59:17,404
exponentially.
And that seems to be what's driving 

1256
00:59:19,091 --> 00:59:22,370
inequality.
You start to succeed and the probability

1257
00:59:22,371 --> 00:59:24,890
that you'll continue to succeed starts 
to expand.

1258
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,100
And we don't know how to control that.
And well here,

1259
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:28,963
here's some other examples of it though,
because I said you couldn't lay it at 

1260
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:33,620
the feet of capitalism.
The same thing happens to cities.

1261
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,290
A small proportion of the cities get all
the people.

1262
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:39,680
So some cities grow like mad and others 
fail catastrophically.

1263
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:40,760
Like,
like Detroit,

1264
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:41,983
it,
it,

1265
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:47,080
it applies to the massive stars.
So there's a very few stars in the Milky

1266
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:49,590
Way that have most of the matter.
Hmm.

1267
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,190
So it applies to the height of trees in 
the,

1268
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,040
in the jungle.

1269
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:53,873
Right.
And do you think if things are 

1270
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:59,690
applicable in cosmology and in biology 
the way that they are,

1271
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:01,793
their application politically and 
sociologically becomes less relevant 

1272
01:00:05,431 --> 01:00:07,710
because you see these phenomena as being
broader,

1273
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:11,100
then you don't know me don't keep an 
interaction

1274
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,800
less relevant.
I just see,

1275
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:19,310
I don't think the left wingers are 
pessimistic enough about the problem.

1276
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,840
They say inequality is a problem.
It's,

1277
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:22,291
yeah,
yeah,

1278
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:23,890
I did call is a problem.
Like it's,

1279
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:26,310
it's a terrible problem.
But then they say,

1280
01:00:26,311 --> 01:00:27,144
well,
it's probably a function of our 

1281
01:00:28,051 --> 01:00:30,390
political and economic systems and we 
could fix those.

1282
01:00:30,391 --> 01:00:31,224
It's like,
no,

1283
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,570
it's not a function of our political and
economic systems,

1284
01:00:33,571 --> 01:00:34,404
or if it is,
it's at such a deep level that we don't 

1285
01:00:35,671 --> 01:00:38,310
know what drives it and we certainly 
don't know how to control it.

1286
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:41,110
Does that,
but does that not mean Jordan that would

1287
01:00:41,111 --> 01:00:45,010
you then reject any attempt to auto 
systems in favor of fairness?

1288
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:47,600
Because it seems to me that the focus is
on like,

1289
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:49,870
and as it would be for clinical 
psychologist,

1290
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,450
individual change.
Now it's part of my personal experiences

1291
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,493
without individual change.
Social change is sort of irrelevant and 

1292
01:00:56,621 --> 01:00:57,454
many great gurus,
which you answered it right then and 

1293
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:00,740
there

1294
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,290
because,
because I am concerned with inequality,

1295
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:05,240
say saying with social instability and 
I,

1296
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,770
and I've thought about it for a long 
time,

1297
01:01:06,771 --> 01:01:07,604
I knew that the left wing approaches 
tended to fail catastrophic and the 

1298
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:13,070
right wing of course isn't particularly 
concerned with inequality.

1299
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:13,630
So that

1300
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:16,050
left wing fails and the right wing don't
care.

1301
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:16,831
Yeah,
that's right.

1302
01:01:16,831 --> 01:01:17,664
That's,
that's fun to see the danger 

1303
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:24,441
sufficiently and the right wing also 
tends to think that the spoils go to who

1304
01:01:24,661 --> 01:01:25,840
deserves the,
yeah,

1305
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:29,040
that's kind of true,
but it's not completely true.

1306
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:32,380
So that's part of that because we're not
all because of course,

1307
01:01:32,381 --> 01:01:33,214
and what I like from a leftist 
perspective would be that we're not 

1308
01:01:35,731 --> 01:01:36,564
starting with from a level playing field
when the system isn't perfect at 

1309
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:40,853
selected.
And this is why I think a spiritual 

1310
01:01:41,851 --> 01:01:42,684
solution,
but it's something that is beneath or 

1311
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:48,810
beyond material is the only way that 
true progress is likely to be achieved.

1312
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:49,793
I was thinking if there's something that
you said before about when we were 

1313
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:53,304
talking briefly about kindness and 
compassion and it occurs to me and this 

1314
01:01:55,631 --> 01:02:00,060
race program I'm sure very simplistic,
but the heroism itself,

1315
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:01,163
by which I mean sacrifice,
the willingness to sacrifice yourself 

1316
01:02:03,871 --> 01:02:04,890
for a greater idea.

1317
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,013
What excites me about the idea now,
and I believe why the phenomena is so 

1318
01:02:08,821 --> 01:02:09,654
loaded,
is if someone is willing to die for 

1319
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:11,523
something,
it's that they believe it's bigger than 

1320
01:02:12,901 --> 01:02:17,010
them and in fact that themself,
their self is not the truest thing.

1321
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:17,963
That there is something greater if I 
will give my life for another person is 

1322
01:02:20,461 --> 01:02:21,294
almost an acknowledgement of oneness.
The temporal illness of the individual 

1323
01:02:24,931 --> 01:02:25,764
eight itself.
And we all worked so hard to achieve 

1324
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:28,464
individuation and I'm sure much of your 
work as a clinical psychologist who's 

1325
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,100
guiding people towards it.
But for me it is just a,

1326
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,093
uh,
temporary resting place because having 

1327
01:02:36,661 --> 01:02:39,150
had the kind of experiences of personal 
humiliation,

1328
01:02:39,151 --> 01:02:40,350
annihilation,
success,

1329
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:43,010
failure for decimation here,
like you know,

1330
01:02:43,011 --> 01:02:44,660
all of these things,
but what,

1331
01:02:44,661 --> 01:02:47,550
what I've been led to and what I 
continue to struggle with this,

1332
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,280
how do I,
how do I serve?

1333
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:52,530
How am I of service?
How do I help her though?

1334
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,270
Do I think that that's,
that is the solution to the problem?

1335
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:56,104
It's like,
I don't think the solution to the 

1336
01:02:56,891 --> 01:03:00,550
problem of inequality is sociological.
I think it's psychological.

1337
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:01,910
I mean,
partly what I'm

1338
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:04,780
dry because it's closer to essence 
because it's my essential,

1339
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:06,493
oh,
because society has to be a reflection 

1340
01:03:08,061 --> 01:03:10,570
of individual psyches or collective 
psyches.

1341
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:13,320
Why is it psychological temptation?

1342
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:15,563
The temptation towards resentment and 
destruction that's associated with 

1343
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:23,541
sociological approaches to inequality is
too great and that as a consequence,

1344
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:25,500
those,
those movements,

1345
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:29,510
10 inexhaustibly to become corrupt and 
destructive began.

1346
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:30,383
I think the orwell put his finger on it 
when he said the middleclass socialists 

1347
01:03:33,721 --> 01:03:37,620
don't like the poor.
They just hate the rich and that hatred.

1348
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:41,430
I think that hatred gets the upper hand 
in sociological movements.

1349
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:45,930
I think that the best approach to 
ameliorating inequality is to strengthen

1350
01:03:45,931 --> 01:03:47,670
the individual.
I mean that and that's,

1351
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:50,670
and that's what I've concentrated on 
doing what we have this program,

1352
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:51,993
uh,
the self authoring suite and there's a 

1353
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:54,624
component of that that helps people 
write an autobiography and another 

1354
01:03:57,121 --> 01:03:57,954
component that helps them write an 
analysis of their personality and 

1355
01:04:00,481 --> 01:04:03,180
another component that helps them write 
out a plan for the future.

1356
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:04,283
And we've used that.
We've studied the effect of having 

1357
01:04:06,361 --> 01:04:10,320
people write out a detailed plan for 
their future and it's a proper plan.

1358
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:10,861
It's like,
okay,

1359
01:04:10,861 --> 01:04:11,694
look,
you,

1360
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:14,550
you get to have what you want three to 
five years down the road.

1361
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,070
You get to have the friends that you 
want.

1362
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:18,180
You get to have the family you want,
you get to have the career,

1363
01:04:18,181 --> 01:04:19,014
you want the education,
you get to take care of yourself 

1364
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:22,314
properly.
You get to withstand the temptations of 

1365
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:28,050
drug and alcohol abuse and other sorts 
of impulsive pleasures.

1366
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,720
You get to make productive and 
meaningful use of your time.

1367
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,910
Okay.
What does that look like for you?

1368
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,280
Write it out,
what does it look like?

1369
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,323
Do you need a vision?
And then you need another vision of how 

1370
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:41,550
terrible things could be if you let all 
your bad habits get the upper hand.

1371
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:42,683
And we've had people do that in an 
experimental situation and most of them 

1372
01:04:45,731 --> 01:04:48,300
are college students.
And the consequences of that,

1373
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:49,620
there were two consequences.

1374
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:50,723
One was general,
which was that university students who 

1375
01:04:54,161 --> 01:04:57,390
were about 30% more likely to stay in 
university and got grades,

1376
01:04:57,391 --> 01:05:01,200
there were were we're about 25% better.
This is a wall of pitting effect,

1377
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:02,243
but even more interestingly,
and this is the coolest thing I think 

1378
01:05:04,141 --> 01:05:06,040
that we ever discovered us in our,
in,

1379
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:10,980
in our psychological research,
we did this research in Holland at the,

1380
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,240
um,
uh,

1381
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:16,230
at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam 
at the Rotterdam School of Management.

1382
01:05:16,231 --> 01:05:17,064
And we ran business students through the
future authoring program for multiple 

1383
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,270
years.
So several thousands of them.

1384
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:26,710
And we stratified them by gender and 
ethnicity.

1385
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,080
Pretty a pretty rough cut.
Men,

1386
01:05:29,081 --> 01:05:34,081
women and then Dutch nationals and non 
Western ethnic minorities.

1387
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,253
Okay.
And so that the performance was like 

1388
01:05:36,461 --> 01:05:38,230
this.
The Dutch women were at the top.

1389
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,440
Then the Dutch men,
then the,

1390
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:44,200
then the non Western ethnic minority 
women,

1391
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:48,880
then the non Western ethnic minority men
and they were behind the Dutch women.

1392
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,380
Bye Bye,
bye.

1393
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,130
They they should about an 80% decrement 
in performance.

1394
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:54,993
Really quite catastrophic.
Two years after they did the future 

1395
01:05:57,491 --> 01:05:59,290
authoring program,
they were ahead of the Dutch women.

1396
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,023
It just blew us away because it was an,
it was a perfect indication of the fact 

1397
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:05,464
that you can use a psychological 
intervention to ameliorate what looks 

1398
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:11,530
like a sociological problem and so I 
think the right,

1399
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,690
see,
I think the right solution,

1400
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:14,643
and this is what I've been saying over 
and over in my my lectures and in this 

1401
01:06:17,051 --> 01:06:17,884
book,
12 rules for life and this is why I 

1402
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:21,010
think it's become so popular.
I said,

1403
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:22,600
look,
you are right.

1404
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:26,020
You are right.
You said earlier in the last question,

1405
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,243
well,
you can't ignore the group 

1406
01:06:28,181 --> 01:06:31,270
classification problem.
You know there's a black experience,

1407
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:33,670
there's a Latino experience,
there's a female experience.

1408
01:06:33,671 --> 01:06:34,780
It's like,
yeah,

1409
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:35,703
that's true,
but you have to decide what level of 

1410
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:38,044
analysis you're going to make primary.
And I think the primary level of 

1411
01:06:41,111 --> 01:06:41,944
analysis is the individual and the 
psychological rather than the group and 

1412
01:06:45,341 --> 01:06:46,174
the sociological.
And I think if you put the individual 

1413
01:06:48,011 --> 01:06:50,800
level first and then you alluded to that
cause it was,

1414
01:06:50,801 --> 01:06:52,990
it was like an intuition that you were 
bringing forward,

1415
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:53,824
which was your intuition has been that 
the right level of progress is made at 

1416
01:06:57,341 --> 01:06:59,830
the level of the individual.
And I think that's true.

1417
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:04,900
I thought that's the end of the level 
where I have personal authority and also

1418
01:07:05,871 --> 01:07:07,970
personal responsibility because the,
here's the thing,

1419
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,220
like here's the rule,
how about this?

1420
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:15,850
Don't recommend any changes that you 
wouldn't suffer for if they failed.

1421
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:19,813
How's that?
And that's the problem with large scale 

1422
01:07:22,431 --> 01:07:23,450
political action.
It's like,

1423
01:07:23,451 --> 01:07:24,950
well,
here's how we should change things.

1424
01:07:24,951 --> 01:07:26,500
It's like,
well they changed them as well.

1425
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,760
It fails.
It doesn't bother me.

1426
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,950
It doesn't hurt me.
I'm not involved in it.

1427
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,070
It's like you should be careful when you
try to change things.

1428
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:35,263
Sure.
You suffered for your own stupid of 

1429
01:07:36,711 --> 01:07:37,311
course.
Of course.

1430
01:07:37,311 --> 01:07:38,144
You wouldn't bet that that also plays 
into the hands of conservatism because 

1431
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,193
you know when you said like that left 
wing change tends to be sort of 

1432
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:46,303
potentially destructive.
These of course these are not just left 

1433
01:07:49,881 --> 01:07:50,714
wing,
right wing radicals to and even not 

1434
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,090
yeah,
there.

1435
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:57,650
And also there is sort of conventional 
politics and the ecological impacts that

1436
01:07:57,651 --> 01:08:00,390
it has the inequality which are like,
whilst your setting,

1437
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:01,263
you continued to say that the,
the problem of inequality is an 

1438
01:08:03,441 --> 01:08:04,800
anthropological,
uh,

1439
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:09,110
biological cosmological physical 
problems to really deep problem.

1440
01:08:09,111 --> 01:08:10,670
It is a deep problem.
And for me,

1441
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:14,750
whenever you get near a problem that has
that level of profundity or ubiquity,

1442
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:16,243
the solution can only be spiritual.
We have to access the transcendent in 

1443
01:08:19,821 --> 01:08:20,654
some way to look for solutions.
And although that sounds a little airy 

1444
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,950
fairy,
why do you believe that?

1445
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:26,270
I mean,
I'm not disputing that,

1446
01:08:26,271 --> 01:08:28,630
but you obviously believe,
I do believe this.

1447
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,740
What,
what drove you to that conclusion?

1448
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:31,603
I've been driven to this conclusion by 
the experiences of personal failure and 

1449
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:39,080
personal limitation by the failure of 
individuation.

1450
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:43,880
By the failure of of my own grandiosity,
the failure of my own ego,

1451
01:08:43,881 --> 01:08:44,714
the failure of fame and power and money 
and sex and drugs that their inability 

1452
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:51,830
of them to reach me in the belly of the 
beast.

1453
01:08:51,831 --> 01:08:52,461
Deep,
deep,

1454
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,710
deep down.
Whether Leviathan is this,

1455
01:08:54,711 --> 01:08:58,190
these cures,
this alchemy was redundant.

1456
01:08:58,430 --> 01:08:59,263
And what I have realized,
I think there's the spiritual journey 

1457
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:03,650
for me,
the hero's journey in like,

1458
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:04,484
you know,
I'm using reference points in which you 

1459
01:09:06,081 --> 01:09:06,914
are an expert and a professor is that 
that the death of the small s self and 

1460
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:15,080
the realization of the capital s self 
means become a servant,

1461
01:09:15,081 --> 01:09:15,914
become a servant of good,
use your abilities to generate the 

1462
01:09:19,581 --> 01:09:20,414
maximum amount of love,
the maximum about of mount of kindness 

1463
01:09:22,941 --> 01:09:27,650
and compassion and to be alert to where 
I can be of most use.

1464
01:09:27,651 --> 01:09:28,484
Now for me,
that can be incredibly limited because 

1465
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:31,880
I'm still a deeply egotistical,
narcissistic,

1466
01:09:31,881 --> 01:09:33,350
flawed,
failing individual.

1467
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,290
But what my focus is,
what my intention is,

1468
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:37,124
what I'm trying to learn to become in 
this journey of self realization is a 

1469
01:09:40,281 --> 01:09:42,230
compassionate and loving man.

1470
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:44,920
So you added something to the tune 
though.

1471
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,510
Well you add useful to that.
Useful,

1472
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:50,010
not useful as a finish.
That's it.

1473
01:09:50,011 --> 01:09:50,844
So the best definition of Christian 
compassion that I ever read was useful 

1474
01:09:54,061 --> 01:09:56,310
and generous.
Right?

1475
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:00,180
Useful and generous.
Right.

1476
01:10:00,181 --> 01:10:02,700
And so I would say the Conservatives in 
air,

1477
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:03,683
the conservatives promote the useful end
of the distribution and the liberals pr 

1478
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,333
promote the generous set.
But I know things need to be brought to 

1479
01:10:10,361 --> 01:10:10,680
you.

1480
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,570
I would say.
And given that the,

1481
01:10:12,571 --> 01:10:13,404
you yourself have said the problem for 
example of hierarchies exist on a far 

1482
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:19,410
broader spectrum than the political that
these than the narrow,

1483
01:10:19,411 --> 01:10:20,244
like when you were saying like on the 
whole left wing Democrat or Republican 

1484
01:10:23,251 --> 01:10:24,084
government or left wing,
right wing governments have produced a 

1485
01:10:25,891 --> 01:10:28,650
similar amount of amount of inequality.
I mean that's sad.

1486
01:10:28,651 --> 01:10:30,150
It's,
I'm not happy about this.

1487
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,260
I know.
Sad thing.

1488
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:32,123
Doesn't it suggest also Jordan that the 
range of solution that were being 

1489
01:10:34,591 --> 01:10:36,900
offered is too limited?
Yes,

1490
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:37,990
it,
I,

1491
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:41,040
I don't think it suggests that.
I think it indicates that,

1492
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,200
yes.
And this is why I think that the problem

1493
01:10:43,201 --> 01:10:46,470
of inequality has to be taken with more 
seriousness than it's being taken.

1494
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,110
And the role of the individual 
[inaudible] obviously you would focus on

1495
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:52,660
this as a clinical psychologist is 
paramount because like,

1496
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,713
cause I kind of believe when I think 
about sort of a sort of a fluctuating 

1497
01:10:56,971 --> 01:11:00,810
vivid grotesque right wing phenomena 
such as Donald Trump,

1498
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,720
I don't blame people for voting for 
Donald Trump.

1499
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,553
I understand why people feel furious.
I understand the emotion of anger and 

1500
01:11:08,521 --> 01:11:09,354
rage and I suspect that all or all that 
plays out in the Zoetrope of the 

1501
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:14,274
material realm is a reflection of the 
activity in the psyche activity in 

1502
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:18,663
emotion.
How could it be otherwise except for 

1503
01:11:19,711 --> 01:11:20,544
your course you say it cause in lobsters
and nature so that suggest it's even 

1504
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:28,290
more profound or the that the psyche is 
deeper than just human,

1505
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,153
right?
The psyche is all the universal 

1506
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:32,124
conscious and unconscious mind.
So I suppose what I suppose what I'm 

1507
01:11:35,881 --> 01:11:39,690
thinking is how,
what my interest is is how can I,

1508
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:41,413
let me ask you a question.
What do you think that you've done in 

1509
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:45,180
the last year?
That's good.

1510
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,280
They are mostly small things.
Acts of kindness.

1511
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,830
I have a daughter.
You have a good relationship with her so

1512
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,970
that seems to be a good thing.

1513
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,833
That's been beautiful.
That's been sort of in fact that is 

1514
01:11:56,281 --> 01:11:57,114
hugely significant.
My new found ability to live at one 

1515
01:12:00,631 --> 01:12:02,820
might refer to as an ordinary domestic 
life.

1516
01:12:02,821 --> 01:12:06,270
My willingness to let go of other 
people's perception of maybe things have

1517
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:08,850
all been hugely significant and my sort 
of,

1518
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:09,933
I would say my dedication to sort of 
self improvement in areas that could 

1519
01:12:12,931 --> 01:12:14,730
still be regarded as selfish is one 
thing.

1520
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:17,400
Still an improvement to sort of take 
exercise to look after myself.

1521
01:12:17,401 --> 01:12:18,234
I'm like drug and alcohol free for like 
15 years and at this point that the 

1522
01:12:20,851 --> 01:12:23,280
epiphany's are beginning to sort of 
coalesce.

1523
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:24,263
The things that that I feel I'm perhaps 
most important is to let go of self 

1524
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:28,240
centeredness.
When I,

1525
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,153
when I conduct myself in a,
when I'm not continually thinking what 

1526
01:12:31,471 --> 01:12:34,500
can I get when I don't look at the 
outside world as a resource when I don't

1527
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:35,820
think,
what can that person give me?

1528
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,740
What can they give me when I think he's 
dead?

1529
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,670
I have a chapter on that and 12 it's 
called,

1530
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,820
it says do what is meaningful,
not what is expedient and to do,

1531
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,350
to view the world as a place of 
resources that can be delivered to you.

1532
01:12:49,351 --> 01:12:53,610
It's in some sense to be expedient is to
take the short term,

1533
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:56,550
it's to take the approach of short term 
gratification,

1534
01:12:56,551 --> 01:12:57,800
something like that.
Yes.

1535
01:12:57,801 --> 01:13:02,040
Self centered is materialistic too.
It is materialistic but it's also,

1536
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:04,730
it's also,
it's not optimal and it's,

1537
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:05,603
it's not wise and the reason for that is
is that it actually turns out like if 

1538
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:11,340
we're going to have,
if we had a continuing relationship,

1539
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:15,390
I would want to try to do a little bit 
more for you than you do for me.

1540
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:16,853
I could do that even purely selfishly 
say because if I did a little bit more 

1541
01:13:19,921 --> 01:13:20,754
for you than you did for me,
you would want to keep interacting with 

1542
01:13:22,771 --> 01:13:23,010
me.

1543
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:24,050
How does that,
all right,

1544
01:13:24,051 --> 01:13:26,430
so cause me and you I think get on 
relatively easy.

1545
01:13:26,431 --> 01:13:28,290
We've found a frequency to communicate 
on,

1546
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,650
but say someone like the woman both high
in openness,

1547
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,110
high in openness is a good service.
Now,

1548
01:13:34,111 --> 01:13:34,944
what about the woman on Channel Four 
news who seemed more agitated and stuff 

1549
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:39,623
like do like me?
So we were actually having a 

1550
01:13:42,181 --> 01:13:43,014
conversation,
we're trying to have a conversation 

1551
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:45,683
that's oriented towards discovering 
something and you think she has a sort 

1552
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:48,924
of a series of linear bar model fruits 
affects and she was just dropping them 

1553
01:13:51,931 --> 01:13:53,610
regardless of what came back.
Definitely.

1554
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:57,420
That's exactly what happened except once
there was once when you,

1555
01:13:57,421 --> 01:13:59,850
and you'll be mean to me and she was a 
bit like founded.

1556
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:00,361
Yeah.
Yeah.

1557
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:01,194
Well when I complimented her on her 
ability to really be an issue on the 

1558
01:14:03,211 --> 01:14:05,880
spot when she said that she was the 
wrong thing to do.

1559
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:07,290
Yes,
yes.

1560
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,680
Now the,
uh,

1561
01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:11,050
you are an academic,
uh,

1562
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:14,110
clinical psychologist,
but in this moment,

1563
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:16,120
do you not feel like it's a question 
that could be,

1564
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:18,140
you could easily post to me to feel 
like,

1565
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,173
I just want this,
like that's the person that's been in 

1566
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:22,990
front of you.
That's the world in that moment.

1567
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:24,910
I don't think you have a particular 
hospital to that person.

1568
01:14:24,911 --> 01:14:26,170
I'm messy,
but like,

1569
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:27,480
uh,
do you not feel like in,

1570
01:14:27,481 --> 01:14:32,481
in that moment it w it would be of value
and of service to nurture that person?

1571
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:34,234
Yes,
yes.

1572
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:35,323
Well,
I had a conversation with a friend of 

1573
01:14:36,231 --> 01:14:37,670
mine,
very smart friend of mine,

1574
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:40,430
his name is Wayne Marecki.
Um,

1575
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,310
he's quite,
he's quite the character wing,

1576
01:14:43,311 --> 01:14:44,144
but he w he watched and I've had people 
watch what I've been doing for the last 

1577
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,650
18 months.
Lots of people.

1578
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:51,110
And they report on what they think about
what I'm doing.

1579
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:53,960
And so I asked Wayne about the interview
and um,

1580
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:55,123
you know,
he was happy about the fact that I 

1581
01:14:56,001 --> 01:14:59,180
conducted myself with a certain amount 
of Carmen detachment and,

1582
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:01,700
but he did say something very 
interesting.

1583
01:15:01,701 --> 01:15:03,560
There was this,
there was the kind of,

1584
01:15:03,561 --> 01:15:04,394
the culmination of that interview was 
where Kathy was challenging me about my 

1585
01:15:08,451 --> 01:15:10,550
right to say things that might offend 
someone.

1586
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:11,623
And I said,
well,

1587
01:15:11,870 --> 01:15:12,591
I said,
essentially,

1588
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:13,424
look,
you've based your whole career and this 

1589
01:15:14,601 --> 01:15:16,460
interview on that.
Right.

1590
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:18,560
You know,
and congratulations to you.

1591
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,100
That's what you should be doing.
And then she was taken aback by that and

1592
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:24,230
I said,
Gotcha.

1593
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:25,813
And she,
she knows she was sort of flustered and 

1594
01:15:26,871 --> 01:15:28,190
she said,
well yeah you did.

1595
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,050
And Wayne said,
you know,

1596
01:15:30,051 --> 01:15:30,884
you could have instead of saying Gotcha 
at that point you could have taken the 

1597
01:15:34,191 --> 01:15:35,024
opportunity there to,
to expand on that opening and to try to 

1598
01:15:39,531 --> 01:15:44,531
have Jason Conversation very north lane 
for not doing that yet Christian thing.

1599
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:48,223
Yeah.
Yeah.

1600
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,850
Okay.
So I thought,

1601
01:15:49,851 --> 01:15:51,530
and I thought about that a lot.
I thought,

1602
01:15:51,531 --> 01:15:52,364
well that,
I think there were limitations in the 

1603
01:15:54,711 --> 01:15:55,544
format.
Like by that time we were about 25 

1604
01:15:57,741 --> 01:15:59,270
minutes into the interview,
you know,

1605
01:15:59,271 --> 01:16:01,400
so it was coming,
it was coming close to an end.

1606
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:02,383
And you know,
sometimes being funny cause I think it 

1607
01:16:04,191 --> 01:16:07,100
was reasonably funny.
It was reasonably witty sometimes.

1608
01:16:07,101 --> 01:16:07,934
That's okay too.
Well that's why comedians are useful 

1609
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,060
because they say funny things,
but this Justin,

1610
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:14,923
yeah,
well hopefully they do and hopefully 

1611
01:16:16,851 --> 01:16:18,200
they can get away with it.
Right.

1612
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,253
And I think that that's often an 
extremely effective conversational 

1613
01:16:23,181 --> 01:16:23,820
maneuver

1614
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:24,653
because he actually,
as a matter of fact you said so who 

1615
01:16:25,591 --> 01:16:26,520
aren't coming to this.
Another thing,

1616
01:16:26,521 --> 01:16:29,580
I'm just frying a few things at you now 
because you know the reason I do this,

1617
01:16:29,581 --> 01:16:31,700
cause I started doing a good degree at a
university of course,

1618
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:34,230
so as called religion and global 
politics and one of the main things they

1619
01:16:34,231 --> 01:16:35,064
taught taught me there,
or one of the things I've intrigued me 

1620
01:16:36,691 --> 01:16:39,270
is the first thing they show you is this
bit of a bull shark.

1621
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,133
There's bear literature by Boucher where
some story can't remember it called the 

1622
01:16:42,481 --> 01:16:46,960
Chinese emperor system of taxonomy where
a show and the stories of the house.

1623
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:47,873
I loved that game and I like,
and it's sort of an part of the courses 

1624
01:16:50,671 --> 01:16:54,600
they took about who gets to determine 
what words like natural or power.

1625
01:16:54,601 --> 01:16:54,991
I think,
you know,

1626
01:16:54,991 --> 01:16:57,600
who gets to determine how those terms 
are allocated,

1627
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,440
who gets to determine what's right 
deemed

1628
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,273
religious,
what's being rejected to build 

1629
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:03,753
[inaudible] because I wasn't going to 
let the radical left just decided the 

1630
01:17:07,101 --> 01:17:10,660
linguistic playing ground and that's,
they were trying to do you see their,

1631
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:14,000
their rationale was we're on the side of
transgender people.

1632
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:14,871
I said,
no you're not.

1633
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:16,730
You're trying to control the linguistic 
territory

1634
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:21,010
in a sense like this is where this 
conversation is a cure.

1635
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:22,043
The parallels that conversation I had 
with Sam Harris cause we have Sam 

1636
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,033
Harris.
What I found myself saying is why are 

1637
01:17:27,171 --> 01:17:28,004
you so worried about this one particular
issue of zealousness or extremism when 

1638
01:17:33,861 --> 01:17:37,280
it seems that power is actually situated
elsewhere.

1639
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:38,091
It seems to me that,
you know,

1640
01:17:38,091 --> 01:17:38,950
I'm lost,
you know,

1641
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:42,500
in that instance I suppose because that 
was the incidence that came your way.

1642
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,280
Uh,
you,

1643
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,470
you as you told me at the radical left,
you know,

1644
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:47,940
imposition of certain rules around 
language that you have.

1645
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:50,670
That was the reason for me plus the fact
that be split.

1646
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:53,600
But you have also continued to Farro or 
plow that far over.

1647
01:17:53,601 --> 01:17:54,434
Haven't you have considered tenue down 
or sort of a line that seems like Telia 

1648
01:17:57,310 --> 01:18:00,710
logically sensible with what happened 
there?

1649
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,330
Like is it continues to be,
he's like in a,

1650
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:03,140
I know what you're saying.

1651
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:05,890
Like I agreed with your analysis of the 
word proverb provocateur.

1652
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:07,820
If you don't,
you know there's a person is provoked if

1653
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:09,260
they're not provoked,
you're not a provocateur.

1654
01:18:09,261 --> 01:18:12,320
So we say difficult labeled to apply to 
anybody.

1655
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:14,560
But it seems to me that you know when 
some,

1656
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,460
when people say,
you know,

1657
01:18:16,461 --> 01:18:21,240
young males are particularly sort of it 
attracted to your work,

1658
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:26,530
I do see that this is a time where males
need guidance and like where there isn't

1659
01:18:28,281 --> 01:18:30,890
the kind of elders,
our elders,

1660
01:18:30,891 --> 01:18:33,050
customs,
initiations,

1661
01:18:33,051 --> 01:18:35,570
routes to masculinity are in short 
supply.

1662
01:18:35,571 --> 01:18:38,420
I can see that there's a real value in 
that,

1663
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:43,310
but I also feel that in this time of 
social contention,

1664
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,173
I then EU politics being part of it up 
and conflict that will ideas that 

1665
01:18:48,741 --> 01:18:49,574
promote unity and the emulation.
If those kinds of boundaries I feel to 

1666
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,830
me it would be particularly and 
especially valuable.

1667
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,083
Do you know,
again,

1668
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,950
the right way to do that is to 
concentrate on the individual.

1669
01:19:03,190 --> 01:19:05,320
And so,
so let me answer that two ways.

1670
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:06,363
The first thing,
the first issue is that it isn't self 

1671
01:19:09,251 --> 01:19:10,084
evident that the reason that my,
what I've been talking about has been 

1672
01:19:14,561 --> 01:19:17,230
attractive to young men.
That might be uh,

1673
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,333
uh,
like a fluke and it might be a fluke 

1674
01:19:20,561 --> 01:19:23,320
because almost everybody who watches 
youtube is male.

1675
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:24,213
Yeah.
So like if I look at my youtube 

1676
01:19:26,171 --> 01:19:27,670
audience,
it's 80% male,

1677
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:30,220
but that's true of youtube audiences in 
general.

1678
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:32,490
So it's just a typical youtube audience.
Right.

1679
01:19:32,491 --> 01:19:34,680
And so what's his that you intuition 
well,

1680
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:37,910
cause I complicated

1681
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,833
did not.
But I do know that since my book has 

1682
01:19:40,421 --> 01:19:42,750
come out,
I've been watching the,

1683
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,930
the demographics of my,
of my public audience that more and more

1684
01:19:46,931 --> 01:19:50,200
and more women are coming out.
So it's now to about 65,

1685
01:19:50,201 --> 01:19:51,610
35 from 80,
20,

1686
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:53,860
and more and more older people are 
coming out too.

1687
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:54,933
So I think a fair bit of it was a 
consequence of the fact that most of my 

1688
01:19:58,361 --> 01:20:01,540
exposure and was to the youtube 
audience,

1689
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:02,374
which happens to be mostly men.
Now I do also think that there a 

1690
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,600
particular crisis with regards to what 
might be described as proper pathways to

1691
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:14,670
masculinity.
I also think that's at play.

1692
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:17,250
So I think there's two factors.
But I also,

1693
01:20:17,251 --> 01:20:20,520
I don't think Kathy Newman kind of went 
after me about this,

1694
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:21,121
you know,
she said,

1695
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:21,661
well,
you know,

1696
01:20:21,661 --> 01:20:23,640
if you're directing your message towards
young men,

1697
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:28,350
which I wasn't assuming that's the case,
isn't that divisive?

1698
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:29,280
And I would say,
well,

1699
01:20:29,281 --> 01:20:31,560
I don't think it is divisive because 
first of all,

1700
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:35,070
the masculine in women also needs to be 
developed.

1701
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:36,420
It's very,
very important.

1702
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:37,523
And the people who are the enemies of 
the masculine in men are also the 

1703
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:44,280
enemies of the masculine and women.
So if you overprotect your sons,

1704
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:46,680
let's say you don't want to,
you don't want to,

1705
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:47,880
you want to,
uh,

1706
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,370
you,
you overprotect them in part and,

1707
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,233
and,
and weaken them because you were afraid 

1708
01:20:52,411 --> 01:20:53,244
of their masculine energy.
You're going to do exactly the same 

1709
01:20:54,511 --> 01:20:56,030
thing to your daughters.
So that,

1710
01:20:56,031 --> 01:20:56,864
that,
that,

1711
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,900
so that,
that the evil is that female,

1712
01:20:58,901 --> 01:21:01,680
a female child would similarly be 
disempowered?

1713
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:02,381
Oh,
definitely.

1714
01:21:02,381 --> 01:21:03,910
Because you know,
the thing is,

1715
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:04,990
this is another thing.

1716
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:08,460
I am a psychometrician that's 
technically my,

1717
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:09,383
my job and we study may our measurement.
Well and like it's a truism of 

1718
01:21:14,881 --> 01:21:19,620
psychometrics that men and women are 
more the same than they are different.

1719
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:20,723
You know,
it's funny because I've been sort of 

1720
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:26,310
positioned as someone who is constantly 
on about the differences between men and

1721
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:28,740
women,
but men and women are more the same than

1722
01:21:28,741 --> 01:21:29,574
they are different.
And what that means is that the 

1723
01:21:31,681 --> 01:21:32,514
development of masculinity and women,
perhaps it's not as important as the 

1724
01:21:35,611 --> 01:21:38,820
development of masculinity in men,
but it's damn important.

1725
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,713
It's like it's a close second.
And so if people are pushing down 

1726
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:47,290
masculinity as a virtuous motive being,
then it's,

1727
01:21:47,291 --> 01:21:49,550
it has a detrimental effect on both.
Next Buddy.

1728
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:50,990
I agree with this,
uh,

1729
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:51,853
but I,
but you would say did the determinately 

1730
01:21:53,271 --> 01:21:54,104
there and biologically that there is,
I think that his masculinity and that 

1731
01:21:57,421 --> 01:21:58,254
thing,
masculinity is present in both females 

1732
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,530
and males.
Definitely.

1733
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,061
Um,
but I,

1734
01:22:02,061 --> 01:22:03,300
I think again,
one of the,

1735
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,193
one of the challenges that this argument
or the appears to be built around is a 

1736
01:22:08,671 --> 01:22:13,560
sort of hierarchy around those traits.
Masculinity being synonymous.

1737
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:15,270
For example,
with power.

1738
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:15,901
Oh,
here's the thing.

1739
01:22:15,901 --> 01:22:18,010
I wanted to bloody ask him,
check this out.

1740
01:22:18,011 --> 01:22:18,844
Cause he was a bit,
I said it on a youtube video on my own 

1741
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:22,620
the other day and a four seat wonder if 
they stand up to scrutiny.

1742
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:24,270
That's,
give it a bit,

1743
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:26,550
check this,
I sit like in Sweden,

1744
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:29,640
they're banning sexually provocative 
advertising and now it's a kind of thing

1745
01:22:29,641 --> 01:22:31,920
you hear a lot about like the 
objectification of women.

1746
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,710
And I said to go,
of course I support that because there's

1747
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:34,553
a male being subjected to lots of 
sexualized images of women has to a 

1748
01:22:38,101 --> 01:22:39,820
degree affected,
uh,

1749
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,250
you know,
particularly when I was younger,

1750
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,233
my,
the logical conclusion to that is 

1751
01:22:44,011 --> 01:22:45,000
pornography,
right?

1752
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:45,923
Yes.
That doesn't really seem to be a good 

1753
01:22:46,981 --> 01:22:48,540
thing.
It doesn't seem to be a good thing.

1754
01:22:48,541 --> 01:22:49,374
Yeah.
I don't look at pornography any more 

1755
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,260
light,
but pornography I think is,

1756
01:22:52,261 --> 01:22:53,310
yeah,
very corrupting,

1757
01:22:53,311 --> 01:22:54,144
corrosive influence for me personally.
It's not something I going to be 

1758
01:22:57,151 --> 01:22:58,910
involved in.
I sit this check base.

1759
01:22:58,950 --> 01:22:59,630
Yup.
I goes,

1760
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:00,463
um,
I feel the use of the female in 

1761
01:23:03,841 --> 01:23:04,674
advertising a in general is the ease of 
the perverted desire to worship the 

1762
01:23:12,851 --> 01:23:13,684
feminine then negate it and neglected.
Feminine has found it's expression 

1763
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:19,023
through consumerism and commerce because
it is not being properly honored 

1764
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:26,220
socially.
What's your heart?

1765
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,750
I made it up.
I would have to think that.

1766
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:30,610
I'd have to think about that a little 
time.

1767
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:34,260
I would have to think about that a long 
time because ideally it's,

1768
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:37,570
it's an idea worth we're thinking about 
for awhile,

1769
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,420
like if there are essential,
if we have a central yearnings,

1770
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:42,450
if we have like in like eeg,
if we,

1771
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:43,323
if the in,
if in indigenous cultures we would have 

1772
01:23:47,771 --> 01:23:52,771
diabetes to represent gender or certain 
energies that are subtler than gender.

1773
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:54,663
If there is a sense that socially those 
energies are not being expressed on it 

1774
01:23:57,551 --> 01:24:01,270
as you've implied with a male pathways,
that's definitely the case.

1775
01:24:01,271 --> 01:24:02,104
So one of the things that I've often 
thought about etiologies is that 

1776
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:05,203
they're,
they're like parasites on religious 

1777
01:24:06,311 --> 01:24:08,470
structures.
And if you're thinking that the,

1778
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:13,660
the movement of feminine imagery up into
the consumerist world is an analog or is

1779
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:15,253
at least in partial partial part,
a consequence of not having a symbolic 

1780
01:24:19,091 --> 01:24:21,550
place where that attraction can be 
expressed.

1781
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:23,310
I think that's probably right.
It's like,

1782
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,920
it's like in the United States is the,
the first family tends to be turned into

1783
01:24:26,921 --> 01:24:28,070
king and Queen.
Yeah.

1784
01:24:28,071 --> 01:24:30,520
Because there's no place for that 
symbolic projection.

1785
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:31,730
Yeah.
The template requires it.

1786
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:34,870
I heard once an analysis of the Soviet 
Union,

1787
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:35,743
uh,
after the revolution that it mimicked 

1788
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,073
the monarchy tyranny that proceeded it 
just in a different format and as 

1789
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:44,380
seeing,
yeah.

1790
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:47,020
That so certain energies,
Holy Trinity even,

1791
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:47,854
right?
Yes.

1792
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:49,330
Mao,
Marx,

1793
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:52,600
Lenin and Stalin depending on the 
trinity.

1794
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:53,793
And some would argue that we know sort 
of like the Christianity couldn't take 

1795
01:24:56,711 --> 01:25:00,490
hold in Latin America until they 
embraced the Pantheism of the saints and

1796
01:25:00,491 --> 01:25:03,310
found and the figure of a virgin until 
they like,

1797
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:04,144
they know that in certain cultures the 
the virgin had to be elevated because 

1798
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:10,060
there isn't a place in the father,
son,

1799
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:12,760
Holy Ghost,
for the divine feminine.

1800
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:13,960
You know,
that's a union idea.

1801
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:14,903
Yeah,
yeah.

1802
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:16,150
Oh yeah,
definitely that,

1803
01:25:16,151 --> 01:25:17,770
that's,
that's an original idea of yoga.

1804
01:25:17,771 --> 01:25:21,910
This is that cool that the trinity is 
missing a core tile and sometimes that's

1805
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:24,100
core tile is filled by the finger of the
devil,

1806
01:25:24,101 --> 01:25:26,020
and sometimes it's filled by the finger 
of the woman.

1807
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,410
So it's like,
it's like the houses in Harry Potter,

1808
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:30,693
right.
There's three good houses and slitherin 

1809
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:32,710
is,
yeah,

1810
01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:34,150
there's in the bottom quadrant,
it's a,

1811
01:25:34,151 --> 01:25:36,580
it's a reflection of the same kind of 
Mandela structure.

1812
01:25:36,581 --> 01:25:38,290
That's pretty cool.
It's very cool.

1813
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:39,963
Very cool.
Have a place at the table for the 

1814
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:42,094
serpent.
You have to have a place that was in 

1815
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:45,610
sleeping beauty,
right.

1816
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,400
In the Disney movie.
They don't let in that they don't crone.

1817
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,313
That's right.
They don't invite her to the 

1818
01:25:50,321 --> 01:25:51,154
Christening.
And so their daughter ends up 

1819
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:53,830
unconscious,
right?

1820
01:25:53,831 --> 01:25:55,840
They don't let the terrible mother come 
to the party.

1821
01:25:55,841 --> 01:25:58,450
So how odder ends up unconsciously now.
Domestic normal,

1822
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:01,750
everyday quotidian lives.
What is the parable mother?

1823
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,480
How does that help section 
overprotection

1824
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,960
down?
I've ever protect the baby.

1825
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:08,120
Late fall over a little bit.
That's right.

1826
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:10,700
You do do the least amount possible for 
your children.

1827
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:12,770
It's something like that.
That's not neglect.

1828
01:26:12,771 --> 01:26:15,320
It's nothing like that.
It's like the old age home adage,

1829
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:16,760
you know,
look,

1830
01:26:16,761 --> 01:26:18,380
I've seen this lots of times with 
parents.

1831
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:21,350
It's like maybe you have to get your kid
dressed up to go out.

1832
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:22,880
Well,
it takes a long time.

1833
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:24,650
If you let your kid do it,
you know,

1834
01:26:24,651 --> 01:26:25,484
it's a lot faster just to do it.
It's a lot faster not to have them set 

1835
01:26:28,281 --> 01:26:30,680
the table.
It's a lot faster to do things for them.

1836
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:32,840
Plus there's,
there's also,

1837
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:35,420
and this is part of the devouring mother
archetype,

1838
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:38,420
is like if you've devoted your life to a
child,

1839
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:41,510
perhaps more than you should have,
let's say,

1840
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:43,880
then it's very difficult to let the 
child go.

1841
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:44,780
What?

1842
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:45,613
What's there left for you.
And so there's this terrible temptation 

1843
01:26:48,441 --> 01:26:51,410
to play.
We'll all do everything for you,

1844
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:54,710
but you never leave me.
And then for the child to say,

1845
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:55,431
yeah,
that's right.

1846
01:26:55,431 --> 01:26:57,230
That's exactly the right face to make 
for that.

1847
01:26:57,231 --> 01:26:58,064
That's a very terrible thing.
And you see that again in Disney 

1848
01:26:59,821 --> 01:27:00,654
sleeping beauty where maleficent has the
heroic prints in the dungeon and it's 

1849
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,120
laughing at him,
right?

1850
01:27:05,121 --> 01:27:06,830
She's not gonna let them go until he is 
ancient.

1851
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,260
And that's,
and that's a consequence.

1852
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:10,323
Can we see the devouring level?
We'll have some good pop cultural 

1853
01:27:12,231 --> 01:27:14,680
examples of the Disney movies all the 
time.

1854
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:15,733
Um,
in,

1855
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,930
in the little,
the Little Mermaid,

1856
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:18,973
Ursula devouring mother,
the devouring mother shows up all the 

1857
01:27:21,771 --> 01:27:23,210
time.
She's the witch.

1858
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:25,700
She's the swamp dweller.
She's the,

1859
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:28,700
she's the evil queen in Snow White was 
the counterpoint.

1860
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:30,540
The fairy godmother.
Fairy God mother.

1861
01:27:30,541 --> 01:27:30,950
Just one.

1862
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:32,300
Yeah.
That's the positive feminine.

1863
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:33,410
And that,
that happened,

1864
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:36,620
that that archetype manifests itself all
over the place as well.

1865
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:37,581
The,
the,

1866
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:38,990
the fairy godmother's a good one.
Yeah.

1867
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,010
And you'll see in,
in,

1868
01:27:40,011 --> 01:27:40,844
in,
uh,

1869
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:42,320
in sleeping beauty,
there's three of them.

1870
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:44,930
Three little fairies that take care of 
the princess and the forest.

1871
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:47,270
They're there.
The archetype of the positive feminine,

1872
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,910
so,
so you always see,

1873
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:50,833
one of the things that distinguishes a 
religious viewpoint from an ideological 

1874
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:58,901
viewpoint is that there's always a 
representation of nature or the unknown.

1875
01:27:59,060 --> 01:27:59,893
Always you need one.
And if that's highly guys think 

1876
01:28:03,951 --> 01:28:07,430
Christianity is the online,
well in Christianity,

1877
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:09,020
I'd have to think about that for a 
minute.

1878
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,350
It partly,
it's the virgin mother.

1879
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:15,020
It's mostly a positive representation in
Christianity,

1880
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:16,393
so and that that would be the 
representation of the benevolence of 

1881
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:21,110
nature.
It's something like that.

1882
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,520
So that's the unknown.

1883
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:23,713
But in a religious representation you 
have the positive and the positive and 

1884
01:28:28,481 --> 01:28:31,220
the negative aspect of the feminine.
That's also the unknown.

1885
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:33,290
You have the positive and negative 
aspect of the,

1886
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:35,120
of the,
of the state.

1887
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,610
That's the wise king and the d and the 
devouring king,

1888
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:41,660
and you have the positive and negative 
representation of the individual and the

1889
01:28:41,661 --> 01:28:45,950
reason it's religious in some sense.
It's hard to explain why in a very short

1890
01:28:45,951 --> 01:28:46,784
period of time,
but a religious viewpoint always gives 

1891
01:28:48,711 --> 01:28:51,230
you a balanced viewpoint.
That's what makes it religious.

1892
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:54,380
It's like there's a positive element.
It's intensely positive,

1893
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,380
but there's the negative counterpart and
there's a positive.

1894
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:01,410
So let me give you an example here.
Um,

1895
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:04,680
I can give you an example of how this 
plays out.

1896
01:29:04,681 --> 01:29:05,514
Architecturally.
The frontier myth that settled the west 

1897
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:10,800
was essentially heroic,
individual positive,

1898
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,490
bringing,
uh,

1899
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,553
the benefits of ordering culture 
positive to the desolate barren 

1900
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:19,380
wastelands of the west.
Okay.

1901
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:21,570
So it's positive individual,
positive culture,

1902
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:23,490
negative nature.
Okay.

1903
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,473
So that's an ideology,
but it's a powerful story cause it's 

1904
01:29:26,671 --> 01:29:29,400
true heroic individual bearer of 
culture,

1905
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:31,740
barren,
desolate wasteland.

1906
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,633
It's true.
But one of the things that eventually 

1907
01:29:35,071 --> 01:29:35,904
generated was a counter narrative.
And that because it was only half the 

1908
01:29:38,011 --> 01:29:38,844
story,
that counter narrative was the 

1909
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:40,254
environmental narrative,
which was rapacious individual bringing 

1910
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:47,060
pillaging society into benevolent 
nature.

1911
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:48,083
And they had to recast the indigenous 
people that lived on those land masses 

1912
01:29:50,911 --> 01:29:51,744
is savage,
is not entitled to the same rights roic 

1913
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:56,533
individually.

1914
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:59,020
There were actually two competing 
tendencies in,

1915
01:29:59,030 --> 01:30:01,690
in the western mind.
One was the noble savage.

1916
01:30:01,691 --> 01:30:03,520
So that was the first son.
Exactly.

1917
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,920
And the other was denison barbaric.
Dan is enough.

1918
01:30:06,921 --> 01:30:07,070
Yeah,

1919
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:09,020
the uninhabited waistline.
So those are both arms.

1920
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:11,023
The romantic idea of the noble savage 
became some sort of whimsical new age 

1921
01:30:14,061 --> 01:30:14,894
thing,
and they have a one and the other one 

1922
01:30:15,811 --> 01:30:18,980
that Dennis in barbarian became 
justification.

1923
01:30:18,981 --> 01:30:20,600
Vagina side.
All right.

1924
01:30:20,601 --> 01:30:21,434
Listen,
we look to wrap up because I can feel 

1925
01:30:21,981 --> 01:30:23,440
the technological anx,
you know,

1926
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,630
a variety of ways,
but a Dr.

1927
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:27,830
Jordan Peterson or professor Jordan 
Peterson,

1928
01:30:27,831 --> 01:30:28,520
I don't know why,
what,

1929
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:31,250
how to big you up enough with the,
with your prologue.

1930
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:32,481
Thank you.
Oh,

1931
01:30:32,481 --> 01:30:33,560
title.
Thank you very much.

1932
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:35,150
I've really found it fascinating 
conversation.

1933
01:30:35,151 --> 01:30:36,810
You have you enjoyed that conversation?
Yeah,

1934
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:38,360
