1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
What point is the distinction occurring 
between sort of a living,

2
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:05,730
vibrant earth which we participate in 
psychically,

3
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:10,470
spiritually and totally and the earth as
a resource and I wondered if that day,

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,880
I wonder if that occurs in the 
transition from Pantheism,

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,723
paganism to monotheism,
which were the sort of sacred endowment 

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,580
of plants,
animals,

7
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:22,800
et Cetera,
becomes these things are,

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,090
as you say,
instrumental.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,780
Do you think that's so significant?
I think.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,180
I think it's both a cause of this shift 
and a symptom of the shift,

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,430
but the more distance we are from 
nature,

12
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:33,264
the more it seems that God is not in 
nature but is kind of the external 

13
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:41,841
overseer of nature and and actual beings
of nature lose their being ness.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,710
A lot of the things that we blame as 
cars are actually symptom.

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,200
How do you mean?
What do you mean by that?

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,150
I mean,
I'm seeing it a lot in,

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,180
in climate change and environmental ism 
now.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,673
I hope it's okay to keep referring back 
to that because my mind is kind of in 

19
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,300
that space,
but that,

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,733
for example,
one of the most alarming things 

21
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:06,810
happening is what I'm calling the insect
Holocaust.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,753
Have you noticed that there's less bugs 
splatter on the window then when you 

23
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:11,420
were a kid?

24
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,253
Yeah.
That less a good covering of Split 

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,570
Telecon Nice of a Steven Spielberg Sky 
splatter.

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,363
Yeah.
It's not your imagination like there's 

27
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,110
been approximately a 75 percent loss of 
flying insect biomass over 30 years.

28
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,090
So confronted with anything like that or
forest fires or hurricanes.

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,970
This mindset of fundamentalism,
of money,

30
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,900
of war has a jump.
Excuse me.

31
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,120
Have some water from this little baker.
Thank you.

32
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,880
It has us jump to the cause.
What's the cause?

33
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,200
Oh,
insect die off.

34
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:54,000
It must be climate change.
Forest fires.

35
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:56,080
It must be climate change,
um,

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,233
to,
to find an enemy is one of the deep 

37
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:05,970
programs of our culture to solve a 
problem.

38
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,670
Like I.
So my son who's five,

39
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,683
got this book from the library about 
superheroes and it has all these little 

40
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:15,330
anecdotes about the avengers or 
something like that.

41
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,680
Uh,
and each story in there,

42
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,370
the template was the same,
a bad thing is happening,

43
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,623
the cause is a bad guy,
and the solution is to defeat the bad 

44
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:28,650
guy by force.

45
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,183
So this,
this is an example of a reductionism 

46
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,460
that also has us reduced the living 
complexity of earth to a single cause,

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,873
which is why I'm wary of putting all of 
the environmental eggs into the basket 

48
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,430
of climate change and seeing if we only 
solve this one thing,

49
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,750
then everything else will be fine.
And then what do we not see in that?

50
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:55,584
Reductionism?
Reductionism always leaves things out 

51
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,900
and in this case it leaves out the 
repeated dousing of the entire landscape

52
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:06,190
with pesticides over the last 90 years.
It leaves out habitat destruction,

53
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,320
it bleeds,
it leaves out deforestation.

54
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,213
Which one thing that came out of my,
my research for this book is that that 

55
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,940
deforestation and land abuse is a much 
bigger cause of the flood drought cycle.

56
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,200
Forest fires and other things.
Then greenhouse gases.

57
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,020
Well

58
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,853
advantage does the climate change 
narrative give the powerful that is not 

59
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:28,874
in their deforestation habitat 
destruction narrative in order for the 

60
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:34,240
climate change narrative to be favored,

61
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,363
it lends itself to quantitative 
solutions that you can make money off 

62
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:38,334
of.

63
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,170
It's always bad quantatative.
What will you explain what you mean?

64
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,801
Well,
you know,

65
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:43,634
if it becomes a matter of,
of say increase increasing carbon 

66
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:47,384
sequestration,
then you can plant biofuels plantations 

67
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:52,310
across Africa,
Asia and South America,

68
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:55,820
which is happening that the numbers look
good.

69
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,713
The metrics look good,
but what's happening on the ground is 

70
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:02,150
subsistence peasants are being forced 
out of their traditional lifestyles.

71
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,330
Um,
pristine ecosystems are being leveled to

72
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:06,164
plant fast growing trees.
A communal land holdings are being 

73
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:13,130
converted into titled The property.
Um,

74
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,850
indigenous people are getting evicted 
from their land,

75
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,110
like when things get monetized and 
reduced to a number,

76
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,910
the things that you cannot reduce to a 
number get left out.

77
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,460
So the,
in general,

78
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:31,040
the,
when we quantify things,

79
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,143
they fit into a society that is built on
measurement and quantification and 

80
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:41,180
ultimately the conversion of all things 
to the number called value.

81
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,230
It's dangerous.
And I mean,

82
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,220
I could go on and on.

83
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,623
I met our goal and he was talking,
as you might imagine about 

84
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:57,090
environmentalism and climate change 
while I was meeting him,

85
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,953
I felt this feeling of deep frustration 
at not that alcohol might not be a nice 

86
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:03,264
guy because it's sort of documentary 
about him once and I saw he's capping 

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,513
and it did seem like a nice guy and he's
captain with pictures of his dad up and 

88
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:11,700
stuff,
human and uh,

89
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,563
but what I felt was that everything he 
was saying was invisibly caveated with 

90
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:18,114
the phrase,
unless it affects the interests of the 

91
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:22,224
powerful,
we must do something about carbon 

92
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,230
emissions unless it affects the interest
of the powerful.

93
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,083
Then we went day.
We must decide unless you energy 

94
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:30,024
concern,
unless it affects the interest of the 

95
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:34,380
powerful.
This thing that I instinctively felt.

96
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,523
It feels like it maybe relates to what 
you just said and maybe have even more 

97
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:39,870
information on that.

98
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,893
Yeah.
I feel a little suspicious of the 

99
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,793
dominant climate change narrative 
because the powerful are so willing to 

100
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:51,084
accept it.
I think it's a lot less disruptive than 

101
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,640
the alternative narrative that I like to
work with,

102
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:03,641
which is the living earth narrative 
which says that the earth is alive,

103
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,623
that it's health depends on the health 
of its organs and tissues and what are 

104
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:11,960
those.
Those are the forests,

105
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,020
the wetlands,
the seagrass meadows,

106
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:17,000
the mangroves,
the elephants,

107
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,740
the whales,
the fish,

108
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,843
the corals,
everything that is destroyed by 

109
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:22,424
development is necessary.
If you are in the carbon mind fret 

110
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,683
frame,
then even if you value a forest for its 

111
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:37,601
carbon storage and sequestration,
once you've reduced it to that number,

112
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,133
you could cut it down if there's say 
gold to mine underneath it or oil and 

113
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:49,181
plant another for somewhere else to make
up for it because it's just the numbers.

114
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:51,200
Right?
Or You could cut it down,

115
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,420
but install lots of solar panels to 
offset that.

116
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,303
That carbon.
We're not treating Earth as alive and 

117
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,890
and precious and sacred by operating in 
that quantitative mindset,

118
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,990
and I don't think that's a big enough 
revolution.

119
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,883
I don't think that's why we're being 
initiated into a new kind of 

120
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:14,030
relationship to earth.
Not initiated into let's be a little bit

121
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:17,600
more clever in working the numbers.
Yes.

122
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,520
Yes.

123
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,353
All right.
