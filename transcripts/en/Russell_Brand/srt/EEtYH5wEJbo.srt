00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,840
Hello,
you're listening to under the skin where

2
00:00:01,841 --> 00:00:06,760
I Russell brand ask what's beneath the 
surface of people we admire of the ideas

3
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:09,220
that define our time.
The history we're told.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,490
This show is sponsored by me and my 
rebirth tour.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,353
I sponsored it.

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,630
Now it's time for under the skin.

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,740
The nine

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,623
is in all of our social activist and 
filmmaker known for political analysis 

14
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:56,120
and criticism of corporate 
globalization.

15
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:58,190
Her books include no logo,
the shock doctrine,

16
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,800
and this changes everything which was a 
New York Times best seller.

17
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:01,634
She frequently appears on global and 
national list of top influential 

18
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:05,810
thinkers.
One occasion higher up than me,

19
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:09,830
which was infuriating and in 2016 was a 
ward and probably all occasions.

20
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:10,664
That's the only time I've been on the 
list and in 2016 was awarded the Sydney 

21
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:16,460
Peace Prize for activism on climate 
justice.

22
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:17,294
Her new book,
which will be talking about in some 

23
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:22,040
depth is no,
is not enough at MCO.

24
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:25,610
Here is this is a look at how we arrived
at this surreal political moment,

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,330
how to keep it from getting a lot worse 
and how if we keep our heads,

26
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,560
we can flip the script.
So primarily in this book,

27
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,730
no is not enough.

28
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,163
You're talking about trump and what 
trump epitomizes and what trump is 

29
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:43,700
perhaps a symptom of something that you 
can pray.

30
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:48,450
See in this new audio form I can try.
Um,

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,433
first of all,
it's great to be with you and I should 

32
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,610
have done some of that.
You could.

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,540
What I'd really love you.
I think you're really beautiful person.

34
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,660
I think you're a body Sattva to use a 
Buddhist term,

35
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,494
a person that's helping other people to 
enlightenment perhaps at the expense of 

36
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:05,740
our own.
What do we want to hear?

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,190
That's actually,
I think the price.

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,950
Like I say that there's people that 
could go over if they want it,

39
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,813
but they,
I know I'll stick around here for a 

40
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,270
while trying to help other people over.
So that's quite a good compliment.

41
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,313
I remember with great affection the 
previous times that we've met the first 

42
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,704
time when I was in an erratic and 
metropolitan whirlwind of romance with 

43
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,540
my future wife and having just in fact 
interviewed Donald Trump,

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,920
primarily motivated then by this curious
impulse that I had of like,

45
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,110
how is this guy so rich when,
to me,

46
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,280
he seems like he's an idiot.

47
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,463
That's why I couldn't understand it.
Of course I understood that someone had 

48
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,540
given him his money,
follow the lead,

49
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,340
but then,
but meeting him,

50
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:42,360
I kept probing him and thinking,
what is it?

51
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,090
How have you got this money?
What's going on?

52
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,013
And that was before he was president.
We didn't know that he was merely a man 

53
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:48,704
in the ascent at that point.
So it seems as good a point as any to 

54
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,443
launch into your book having 
complimented you and my gratitude for 

55
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:59,890
you coming here and being on our podcast
and the niceties that be observed.

56
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,670
So thank you.
Um,

57
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,690
so look,
I,

58
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,790
I wanted to just put trump in some kind 
of context.

59
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,670
This is not looking at the psychology.
Um,

60
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,953
you know,
there's,

61
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,790
I think a lot out there just about sort 
of pathologizing him as this extreme,

62
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,370
extreme individually and he's certainly 
an extreme individual,

63
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,880
but he's also just a symptom of the 
culture in so many ways.

64
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:28,240
He is the fulfillment of so many of the 
most dangerous trends.

65
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,540
I'm just the worst,
the worst of us really.

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,110
And there's this way in which he's so 
bizarre.

67
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,033
And so unlike what we're used to from 
politicians that I think we talk about 

68
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:41,740
him as if he's some sort of Martian,
you know,

69
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:44,260
what did he do now?
Could he really have just tweeted that?

70
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:46,160
I mean,
what a like this is this,

71
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,720
everyone's,
it describes the state they're in as,

72
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,490
as shock,
but I see it as really,

73
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:52,750
it's more like a cliche.

74
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,740
It's a cliched outcome.
Like of course a culture that fetishized

75
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:59,230
as well,
that federal Spanish eyes celebrity that

76
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,920
fetishize is fakeness.
It at every level.

77
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,463
You know,
if you wrote a science fiction novel 

78
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,983
about a world in which the United States
elected Donald Trump as their president 

79
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,010
and you handed it to your editor editor 
would tell you that.

80
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:16,960
It was too cliched and outcome,
right?

81
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:21,961
It's too predictable and outcome,
and so I think trump is the fulfillment.

82
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,723
I think you're right,
was thinking about the theatrical term 

83
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,813
grotesque,
grotesque is merely an exaggeration of 

84
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,204
the ordinary to make it more 
identifiable and recognizable and these 

85
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:36,940
sort of traits were always present under
the Bush presidency.

86
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:42,510
Galumphing individualism was president 
and buccaneer international,

87
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,460
like internationalist attitude don't 
know internationally.

88
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,800
Those interventions about.
So yeah,

89
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,643
the way it's entirely predictable.
One of the things that are like a 

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,433
fingerprint or I suppose it's because I 
have the privilege of a comedic 

91
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:54,750
perspective.

92
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,750
He's sort of something about him that's 
likable comparatively.

93
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,903
You know what I feel that it is,
is that people got odd on sort of 

94
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:06,540
Clintonian Blair,
right?

95
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,443
You know,
at least he's new labor and like this 

96
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,790
kind of charming,
slick,

97
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,160
superficial,
technocratic,

98
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:15,250
bureaucratic,
so vinea of pleasantness,

99
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:19,330
but Marston indifference and ignorance 
to the needs of the majority of people.

100
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,223
That was disingenuous and untruthful and
Donald trump may be many things and 

101
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,660
clearly as your book outlined,
he is those things.

102
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,250
But what you also seems to be is 
authentic in a bizarre way.

103
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,113
He's not logging.
There's something mad about someone's 

104
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,490
lying,
but he,

105
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,080
he's telling you the truth about being a
liar.

106
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,933
It,
you know,

107
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,880
so he gets caught lying all the time,
but he's open about the fact that he's a

108
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:45,580
liar and he's corrupt and he does 
whatever it takes to win.

109
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,410
And so you can't catch them out on 
anything.

110
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,330
And I think that's what people mean when
they were like,

111
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:51,220
well,
at least he's honest.

112
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,900
Like they don't mean he's technically 
honest.

113
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:54,370
They understand that he lies all the 
time,

114
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,880
tick authentically inauthentic or 
something like that.

115
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,570
Um,

116
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,330
but do you think I'm talking to in a 
sense,

117
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,840
no,
me about economy and energy,

118
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,970
but even though,
I mean to get too hippy dippy here,

119
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:05,804
but like when you,
like if you're watching Hillary Clinton 

120
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,620
talk on television,
there's people.

121
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,463
If people were in the lead up to that 
election and then you watched Donald 

122
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,390
Trump.
So there is a,

123
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,073
even in the grotesqueness and evidently 
the content was irrelevant because if 

124
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,440
someone gets some of the more outrageous
things,

125
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:21,080
so you know,
the sexiest things,

126
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,030
the racist things,
if those things are irrelevant,

127
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,990
then what?
Easier.

128
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,880
That's getting traction.
What easier that's reaching people.

129
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:29,630
Uh,
my idea is that it's authenticity.

130
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,010
There's like,
well fuck it,

131
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,840
you know,
sort of think,

132
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,673
oh wow,
this guy is not Hillary Clinton where 

133
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,783
Hillary Clinton,
most people don't seem to know how to 

134
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:36,404
talk like,
well you see them and like tim resume 

135
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,213
talking off the Greenfield.
You think this person is almost not a 

136
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:43,040
human.
They don't.

137
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,023
They don't know Jesus.
I don't know what we're going to do 

138
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,431
that.
Whereas Donald Trump,

139
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:47,780
when he says,
yeah,

140
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:49,250
I was eating chocolate cake.
You something.

141
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,233
This is bizarre,
but there's something about it that's 

142
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,400
not what I've been used to for the last 
24 years.

143
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,353
And I can see how people are really 
disenfranchised and disillusioned might 

144
00:06:58,401 --> 00:06:59,234
find it appealing.

145
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,160
Well,
I think there's also something,

146
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,200
you know,
Hillary Clinton,

147
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,050
Blair,
um,

148
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,650
you know,
these figures are,

149
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,813
they are the symbol of the Davos class,
like the people up on the mountain top 

150
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,840
at those already.
Well,

151
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:17,330
it's the party that not,
I mean,

152
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,193
you were invited,
but most people were not invited to 

153
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:20,924
write that.
It's,

154
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,730
it's the party of this,
this sort of the winners in this,

155
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,720
in this global economy have a small 
group of super winters and,

156
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,723
and huge numbers of,
of locked out people at the bottom of 

157
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:35,264
that mountain.
And so I think the data summit became 

158
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:41,060
this sort of symbol,
and this is why this phrase devost class

159
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,760
came a little bit into currency,
right?

160
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:48,080
It's this world where you had the 
politicians hobnobbing with the ceos,

161
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:51,650
the billionaires and then a list 
celebrities blessing the whole thing.

162
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,680
And um,
and it was,

163
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,610
it was a world that most people had 
absolutely no access to.

164
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,443
Right?
And I think there's something about 

165
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:05,051
trump and the way there was a strange 
kind of generosity to his wealth in that

166
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:09,530
he did invite the world in.
Like,

167
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,423
I mean,
most,

168
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,010
most wealthy people in the world right 
now,

169
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:16,100
the super rich don't want to flaunt 
their wealth.

170
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,953
Like they understand,
like Bill Gates doesn't want us to see 

171
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:19,904
his,
his many mansions and he doesn't know 

172
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,640
gun curing malaria.
He wants us to see his altruism,

173
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:32,210
right?
Whereas trump said to the world,

174
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,770
like,
come into my mansion,

175
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:34,604
right?
I'm going to turn it into a reality TV 

176
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:38,000
show.
Like people were invited into his wealth

177
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:40,340
and there's a way in which I think 
there,

178
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,100
there is a,
there was gratitude for that.

179
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:43,850
He,
he,

180
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,683
um,
and I think that that is something of 

181
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:47,024
what people mean by authenticity.
Authenticity is such a strange word to 

182
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:55,680
use to describe this sort of festival of
fakeness that is the trump family.

183
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,120
Yes.
Um,

184
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:57,811
but,
you know,

185
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:58,644
and I don't think it is a message that 
could have sold if the alternative was 

186
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:02,844
not Hillary Clinton.
I think if Bernie had been running 

187
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,350
against trump,
the absurdity of this,

188
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,163
you know,
this family that shows in their first 

189
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:18,550
televised interview to address Americans
on a series of golden thrones,

190
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,090
right?
Remember that interview that they did.

191
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,220
So he loves the goal.
He's like a

192
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,091
sofa.
Yeah,

193
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:27,060
like an emperor or assaulting.
Interestingly,

194
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,580
the imagery,
the golden in our country,

195
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,623
the image of him with Nigel farage and a
golden elevate something that became a 

196
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,260
kind of an emblem,
but the but the brazenness seems like an

197
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:41,094
authenticity.
How devoid and bereft of hope must we 

198
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,510
be?
How disillusioned and despairing must we

199
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:48,344
have been that people,
insignificant numbers of women and 

200
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:52,194
people from demographics that you would 
imagine it would feel particularly 

201
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:56,460
offended are like,
no,

202
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:56,970
no,
no,

203
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,100
we prefer that.
We prefer that.

204
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,143
And I think there's a very,
very important lesson for the left in 

205
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:03,800
that.
And I don't see the left learning.

206
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,070
Well,
it depends how you define the left,

207
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:08,120
right?
I think there is,

208
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:13,121
I think fairness and sharing kindness.
I think there has been a learning.

209
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,680
I mean,
I.

210
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,513
When I look at the Corbyn campaign here 
and which I think in some ways is a 

211
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:23,630
reaction to trumpism,
right?

212
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,980
I mean this,
this completely unfocused,

213
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:31,160
grouped unselect the Anti brand,
right?

214
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,113
Jeremy Corbyn is,
I mean the person who actually started 

215
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,943
applying the principles of marketing to 
political parties in a serious way was 

216
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:43,970
Tony Blair.
I mean he.

217
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,523
Well,
I mean when I remember when I was 

218
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:46,934
writing no logo 20 years ago,
it was shocking that there was this 

219
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:57,090
politician who used the word branding to
describe a political party.

220
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:59,570
I mean the new labour,
new labour and,

221
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,610
and they,
they were rebranding the Labour party,

222
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:04,310
giving it a new name.
A new logo was like new coke.

223
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:04,970
Right.

224
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,803
And what I wrote no logo is that Tony 
Blair's Labour party was like a labor 

225
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:11,500
scented party.
And,

226
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:12,334
and this was shocking in the 19 nineties
that you would sort of apply the 

227
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:15,344
techniques used to sell dishwashing 
liquid liquid and Coca Cola to a 

228
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:23,540
political party that he was divorcing 
this word labor,

229
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,810
which traditionally meant working people
from,

230
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,730
from it was [inaudible] it and just 
turning it into a brand,

231
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,323
pulling it up from its roots.
And what I found really moving about 

232
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,200
about Corbin's campaign,
watching it,

233
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,430
you know,
online,

234
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,440
because I wasn't here and particularly 
the Ken loach a little films right?

235
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Was that he put workers for the workers,
started in his campaign,

236
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,183
just regular working people and indeed 
public sector workers who have been so 

237
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,110
steadily vilified over the past 40 years
were the stars of his campaign,

238
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:03,310
not him,
you know,

239
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,683
and then you'd hear be hearing from 
nurses and pediatricians breaking down 

240
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:09,334
crying and teachers just talking about 
the real impacts of austerity and then 

241
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:16,450
you just see the logo labor and it just 
meant labor,

242
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,310
but it wasn't,
it just meant workers.

243
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,510
It just meant it meant what it 
originally meant.

244
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:24,970
And so it sort of felt like,
well,

245
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:27,160
I think people are learning the lessons 
of trump.

246
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,860
They might not be learning it in the US 
yet,

247
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,980
but I think I feel like here there was a
reaction against this,

248
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,023
this fakery.
Whereas in the states you have liberals 

249
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:43,420
who think that the solution to trump is 
getting oprah to run against him.

250
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,280
I mean,
seriously or Mark Zuckerberg get get,

251
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,940
get a liberal billionare to run against 
trump and all will be.

252
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:51,030
Well,
if the broader context like,

253
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,570
isn't it like,
um,

254
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,670
I wouldn't Yanis Varoufakis Yanis 
Varoufakis coming in when he was,

255
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,433
he said like,
I think Wolfgang Schauble said the 

256
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,560
democracies.
All right.

257
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,190
As long as you don't change anything.
Right.

258
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,320
When you started out saying about Blair 
in the mentality of branding,

259
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,363
he was doing something.
Of course it was extremely small in 

260
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:12,844
retrospect.

261
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,903
History is totally disgusting.
That was a lovely North American 

262
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:20,890
reaction to some British coffee I'm 
supposed to say.

263
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,400
I think it's lovely.
That's right.

264
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,990
But that's a reaction now I winching and
recalling in.

265
00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:26,771
Hold on,
sorry.

266
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:30,880
I just had to do that bitter espresso.
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:31,714
It was just,
I felt I needed to super caffeinate 

268
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:35,740
myself to your mouth with you.
Reach through your ears.

269
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,530
I shuttered.
It was a shoulder.

270
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,150
Can I shops a funny story about that?
So I,

271
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,640
I,
as you can tell,

272
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:45,080
I'm North American and,
but I,

273
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,220
I did live in this country for,
for one year,

274
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,163
um,
when I was 10 years old and had an 

275
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:52,920
absolutely terrible time.
And,

276
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,640
and I,
I,

277
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:56,410
um,
went to,

278
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,343
uh,
we lived in Oxford and I went to a 

279
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,430
school that I don't think exists anymore
called Bishop Kirk.

280
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,990
We had that burned down because of you.

281
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,473
But see what North American kids do to 
bond is like the easiest way that you 

282
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:15,790
can make friends as a kid in North 
America is to trash the food,

283
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,010
you know,
at the school cafeteria or,

284
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,020
or it's summer camera,
whatever it is.

285
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,190
That's,
that's how,

286
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,570
that's one of the ways you,
you bond.

287
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,890
And so my first,
yeah,

288
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,490
uh,
we,

289
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,630
we went to the cafeteria and they gave 
us some terrible food and they,

290
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,100
I remember that,
that the pictures of custard,

291
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:33,934
which was a new phenomenon to me,
pewter pitchers of custard and I sat 

292
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:41,770
down at the table of my new would be 
friends at age at,

293
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:44,310
I think I was nine at this point,
not yet 10.

294
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,660
And I said,
this is disgusting.

295
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,280
A little girl named Katie Bennett,
who was the vicar's daughter,

296
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,110
looked up and said,
I think it's lovely.

297
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,943
That's when I realized I wouldn't have 
no British friends even when you had 

298
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,620
been raised by wolves.
Definitely,

299
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:01,454
yeah.
As you criticized our pitchers of 

300
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:04,160
custard,
our listeners,

301
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:07,010
we're off to voting booths and ticking 
the box.

302
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,300
Mark the UKIP.
They're lovely.

303
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,873
Lovely.
I can have a sip of this coffee again 

304
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,630
and then say it.
Nicer reaction.

305
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,093
I think it's a lovely well done,
but that was a little bit of a swallow 

306
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,650
that looked like you were disgusted.
Naomi Klein,

307
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,770
so you were there very much like the 
little boy,

308
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:27,604
the emperor's new clothes you wear.
The little girl that pointed out that 

309
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:34,040
the custard was actually disgusting.
Now I remember reading in,

310
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,013
I read no logo when it was the coolest 
book to read at the time and I was a 

311
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:38,974
heroin addict at that time,
so some of the more dense passages were 

312
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:44,920
tricky and I was already in Cuba while 
making,

313
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:47,020
as I'm sure I've told you,
a chewing gum commercial,

314
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,220
so it was felt somewhat conflicted.
I was in a really no logo which had been

315
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:52,510
reading before I left.
I was reading it.

316
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:55,450
I was making a chewing gum commercial,
the most vacuous of all products,

317
00:15:55,451 --> 00:15:56,284
of course,
unnecessary mimicking of mastication 

318
00:15:58,301 --> 00:15:59,134
while the world staffs and I was in Cuba
where unlike a sort of where there was 

319
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:06,640
the experiment of socialism was sort of 
withering before the eyes,

320
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:07,474
but still something very beautiful and 
incredible and you I suppose in that 

321
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:13,600
book,
No logo,

322
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,910
bringing capitalism to Cuba personally.

323
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,130
I've personally doing my level best.
I was like an agent in a sense to try to

324
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:21,250
try to get naked.
Come on guys,

325
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:22,120
give it a go.
It's not that bad.

326
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,420
They in my fraternity in solidarity,
get that mural down.

327
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,510
Have you tried to delicious coke my 
shop.

328
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,870
I'm like,
try this Bacardi.

329
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:33,730
You'll love it.
It is an insult.

330
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,640
Now tap.
I'm like,

331
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,973
it's like when you talk there about Tony
Blair coopting the language of branding 

332
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:45,010
and consumerism going and applying it in
a political sphere.

333
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,233
Isn't it almost like that the political 
sphere is an enclave within the uber 

334
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:50,404
context of consumerism and capitalism,
so of course that language is going to 

335
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:54,244
have a greater efficacy than a sort of a
particular topical political language 

336
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:03,310
and ideology because we're not living in
a political culture.

337
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,400
We are living in a consumer culture,
so that language,

338
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,730
those images,
that kind,

339
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,520
that kind of discourse is going to be 
more effective because we don't,

340
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,920
we all agree now the other than sort of 
like,

341
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:15,754
uh,
like in the last election in this 

342
00:17:16,271 --> 00:17:18,760
country is cause for optimism in a sense
because you sort of think,

343
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:19,594
oh,
people who vote in our kind of kindness 

344
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:23,440
and people have had enough and people 
are sick of the old models,

345
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,274
but you know,
ultimately things are continuing in the 

346
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:27,340
same way,
isn't it?

347
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,900
Because what we're really,
we live in a consumer culture as opposed

348
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:32,734
to a democratic culture.
I just wonder if it isn't cyclical like 

349
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,850
Wah Wah,
whether we've just maxed out on.

350
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,250
I mean,
this is way I hope.

351
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,130
I hope that Donald Trump is as far as

352
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,130
we're going to take this extraordinary 
experiment of,

353
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,633
of,
of selling absolutely everything in 

354
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:00,120
life,
a corporatizing,

355
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,540
every bit of the comments,
every bit of public space and yes,

356
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,733
then applying the treating politics as 
if it is a corporation and applying the 

357
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:14,640
rules of marketing and branding to 
politics is a natural extension of that.

358
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,103
But I think,
I think it's changing and I think there 

359
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:18,864
is room for a,
another kind of another kind of 

360
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:22,764
political project.
I always felt when I was writing no 

361
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:25,764
logo,
that there was something inherently 

362
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:27,774
hopeful in the fact that companies like 
Nike and starbucks and apple were using 

363
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,790
ideas like revolution,
community transcendence to sell consumer

364
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:43,680
products that could never deliver these 
things.

365
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:44,730
Right.
Um,

366
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,983
and the fact that this started to happen
at the height of the neoliberal period 

367
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:50,880
at the,
you know,

368
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,713
at,
at the,

369
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,680
at the fulfillment of the Reagan 
Thatcher Project,

370
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:58,950
I mean this is when it up to the 
eighties,

371
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,920
the model was,
you know,

372
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:00,754
you make a product a and as a 
corporation you are in the business of 

373
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:07,110
making products and selling those 
products.

374
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,943
And you would then slap a logo on it to 
differentiate it from other products in 

375
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,300
the marketplace and buy advertisements 
and tell people about it.

376
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:17,670
But what changed in the nineties is that
these companies,

377
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:21,670
and this is what no logo is about,
is what the meaning of this flip of,

378
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,840
of companies like Nike emerging and 
saying,

379
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:25,411
well,
actually,

380
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:28,090
we're not a shoe company.
We're not a what,

381
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:29,490
you know,
we're not a trainer company.

382
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,820
We are about the idea of transcendence 
through sports,

383
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:33,654
right?
We are about the idea of you being your 

384
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,590
best of,
uh,

385
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,830
of,
uh,

386
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:40,380
of any kind of,
uh,

387
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,730
you know,
being your best.

388
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:42,870
Just do it.
That's what,

389
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,733
that's what it was about.
Starbucks announced that the meaning of 

390
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:48,510
their brand was the third place,
not home,

391
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:49,710
not work,
but community,

392
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:51,180
a place where we gather,
right?

393
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,973
And this was the period where apple 
started using the iconography of every 

394
00:19:57,151 --> 00:20:00,510
revolutionary movement and Gandhi,
Martin Luther King.

395
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,553
Um,
you know,

396
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,090
as an,
it just said,

397
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:04,140
think different,
right?

398
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:06,000
And these huge billboards.
So,

399
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,860
I mean,
on the one hand you can wring your hands

400
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:08,251
and say,
oh,

401
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:10,170
they're coopting all of our ideas.
Right?

402
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,004
But I always found it quite hopeful 
because with all the best market 

403
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:14,814
research,
what they were finding was that we 

404
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:20,130
wanted more than just trainers and 
laptops and,

405
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,043
and lattes and for capitalism,
this is a great recipe because it keeps 

406
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:27,090
you shopping because as soon as you,
um,

407
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,093
you know,
as soon as you unwrap this new thing 

408
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:32,130
that was supposed to bring you community
and revolution,

409
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,270
you're immediately dissatisfied and have
to shop some more.

410
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,810
So that's great for an economic system 
built on growth.

411
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,213
But it does mean that that part of 
ourselves that longs to be part of 

412
00:20:41,371 --> 00:20:42,204
something bigger than just our atomized 
existence and shopping is parental 

413
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,660
perennially unfulfilled.

414
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,460
So for,
for,

415
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,030
for me as a political animal,
I always thought,

416
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:56,380
well,
we should thank them.

417
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,930
They've done our market research for us.
Um,

418
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:04,050
and so it is the role of social 
movements to rebuild a,

419
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,870
uh,
uh,

420
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,480
opportunities for people to actually get
real community,

421
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:08,314
right?
Because it's not a coincidence that 

422
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:11,650
these companies started selling these 
ideas.

423
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,850
At the very moment when every public 
institution,

424
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,100
um,
every,

425
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,520
every place where we used to get that 
sense of belonging,

426
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:23,350
whether it was organized religion,
you know,

427
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:26,740
whether it was the public square,
all of this is being eroded.

428
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:28,750
So now we're going,
we're,

429
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,620
we're getting it in a temporary state 
through shopping.

430
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,630
Um,
but you know,

431
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:35,464
I think we are at a moment where we're 
starting to see signs that we're 

432
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,460
actually getting it from rebuilding our 
sense of community and belonging.

433
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,830
No.
If the accompanying component,

434
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,430
all of the advent of capitalism,
some grotesque,

435
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,563
a Uber instantiation of which we are 
currently uber the car that really now 

436
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,470
the,
the,

437
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,150
the,
they have now the,

438
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,283
those synonyms have dovetailed.
So this sort of Uber version we labor 

439
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,440
beneath the,
the,

440
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:07,830
the,
uh,

441
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,830
the accompanying idea of socialism has 
possibly be.

442
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,630
I think it'd been discredited because I 
don't think you can,

443
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:16,990
like,
you know,

444
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,800
when you look at sort of perhaps British
socialism,

445
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,733
which is the famous people famously,
there's as much to methodism as marks 

446
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,380
one recognizes that there's not the 
soul.

447
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,330
There is not just one epistemology for 
the idea of fairness and kindness.

448
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:33,460
There is not just one lineage,
not just one room,

449
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,210
but what I feel is that battle has been 
won and I retro spective,

450
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:47,230
resurrection of those old ideas will not
be fulfilling,

451
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,910
but precisely the phenomena that you 
speak of when you say,

452
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,433
oh,
there's this perennial yearning for 

453
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:59,860
belonging now that can be co opted by.
Capitalism can be co opted by,

454
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:02,380
consumerism that you can attach the idea
of,

455
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,260
I want this new phone to the I am an 
individual.

456
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:06,220
I am free.
You can.

457
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,803
What is the indigenous feeling and how 
can the indigenous feeling be properly 

458
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:11,344
utilized?
I don't think by mechanistic or 

459
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:15,550
materialistic idea when we are dealing,
I think with metaphysics,

460
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:17,770
when we're dealing in fact with the 
human spirit,

461
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,380
when we're dealing with something,
even when spoken of in secular terms,

462
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,880
that is a my view,
undeniably a spiritual idea,

463
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,680
but it's also a scientific idea.
I mean the reality of interconnection,

464
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,830
the reality that we are not atomized 
individual,

465
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,683
that we are exist within webs of 
connection with other human beings and 

466
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:40,574
with the natural world.
We exist in relationships of dependence 

467
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:44,960
and interdependence.
How do you mean by that?

468
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,250
Do you mean by that knowing that we 
can't exist without clean water,

469
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:50,084
we can't exist without healthy soil.
We can't exist without an atmosphere 

470
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,400
that creates a bubble that is safe for,
for,

471
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:01,040
for humanity,
and that it's a very fragile state.

472
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,690
Right?
So we can tell ourselves a narrative,

473
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,310
and we talked about this last time,
right?

474
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,373
I mean the narrative that we have been 
telling ourselves since the dawn of the 

475
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:11,204
scientific revolution,
which is a narrative of dominance and 

476
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:14,204
apartness from nature that's in the,
in the span of human history began with 

477
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,020
agriculture or industry.

478
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,460
Did you just say,
um,

479
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,130
I said scientific revolution,
but I mean,

480
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,920
I think it's an interplay between three 
forces.

481
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:28,754
One is Judeo Christianity and,
and the scientific revolution and all 

482
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,750
kinds of new,
uh,

483
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,913
ideas that put humans on a sort of ego 
trip and imagining that all would be 

484
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:44,324
known one day.
And then key technologies that actually 

485
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:49,034
seemed to make the dream of domination 
real and the key technology and all of 

486
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,624
that was the steam engine where you can 
tell yourself a story about who you're 

487
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,730
going to dominate nature all you want.
But until the steam engine,

488
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:05,390
that's a fantasy because you can only 
sell your ships when the wind blows.

489
00:25:05,391 --> 00:25:09,230
You are in a relationship,
a dialogue with the natural world.

490
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:13,160
You need wind in order to sale.
You can tell yourself a story,

491
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,090
uh,
uh,

492
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,990
of dominance,
um,

493
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,640
about your,
your,

494
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,400
your,
your,

495
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,250
your factory.

496
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,000
But the fact is before the steam engine,
you needed rushing water.

497
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,680
You need a water,
a water wheel that,

498
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,543
that,
that needed the water at a certain 

499
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:27,291
level,
right?

500
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,180
So there was a negotiation with the 
natural world.

501
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:31,310
And I think the power of the steam 
engine,

502
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,563
um,
was this idea that now you really are 

503
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:37,094
God.
Human beings really are God in that you 

504
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,020
can sell your ships whenever you want.
You are the boss of nature.

505
00:25:42,021 --> 00:25:44,240
And this is the way the steam engine 
would market it.

506
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,690
And so I think it was,
I think you had,

507
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,563
was it,
you'll now I'll pull to try and know 

508
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:54,430
about kind of thing about power and 
autonomy that you,

509
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,313
you are now the boss of the natural 
world and also more of a boss of your 

510
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:01,540
workers because when your factories are 
immobile,

511
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,670
we mean you can build them wherever 
because you have portable energy,

512
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:07,040
you're not,
you don't build it where,

513
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,903
where the,
where the water is and then you're kind 

514
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:10,640
of captive to your workers.

515
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,630
You can,
uh,

516
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,410
you can be more abusive boss.
You can go where,

517
00:26:14,411 --> 00:26:16,270
where there's a surplus of labor and you
know,

518
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:21,300
a lot of what I'm talking about comes 
from some terrific research by a Swedish

519
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:23,650
historian named Andreas mom.
Um,

520
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,553
so I think,
I think it was a gradual process where 

521
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:30,440
you had the ideas but the ideas weren't 
real until you had the technology.

522
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:34,220
But now we're in this era where it turns
out we were never the boss.

523
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,083
I mean,
this is why I believe climate change is 

524
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:40,520
a spiritual crisis and a narrative 
crisis as well as an ecological crisis.

525
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:42,890
Because what the natural world is 
telling us,

526
00:26:42,891 --> 00:26:44,520
you know,
when asphalt

527
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,180
is melting and Cambridge in Arizona this
summer,

528
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,223
um,
and when Goldman Sachs is buffeted by 

529
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:54,120
Super Storm Sandy is,
you will,

530
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,670
you are not the boss.
Every action has a reaction.

531
00:26:56,671 --> 00:26:58,650
You are still in dialogue with the 
natural world.

532
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,600
Timeframe is altered.
Exactly.

533
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:02,720
So it was not,
there was,

534
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,593
there was about 200 years where we could
tell ourselves this narrative of 

535
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:09,210
apartness and separate NASPA.
But this is why I say it's,

536
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,150
it's not just,
it's not just a spiritual story.

537
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:12,984
And I think the reason why civilizations
understood this for so long is because 

538
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:20,400
they were living at relationships of 
interdependence with nature.

539
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:20,990
Yes.

540
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,823
And a lot of that folk mythology and a 
sort of a early pre monotheistic 

541
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:27,194
religion contained within it.
The ideas that we are rediscovering and 

542
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:33,080
indeed rebranding as scientific 
discoveries.

543
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,450
They were already there.
They were already present.

544
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,060
People talk of mindfulness now is like,
oh,

545
00:27:38,061 --> 00:27:40,700
it turns out that mindfulness does 
really help high heart disease,

546
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,563
but if you can just extract it from all 
this Mumbo jumbo about one living 

547
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:45,614
consciousness manifesting itself on the 
material plane or in a rather more 

548
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,343
potent and shorter three letter words 
and I think that is very difficult to 

549
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,703
introduce a narrative that will 
supersede the narrative that you 

550
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,253
articulated in no logo and subsequently 
described the mutations in much of your 

551
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,800
later work without a story that has I 
more vital visceral,

552
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,840
deeper,
ancient,

553
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,900
potent human truth about one Sun God and
the nature of consciousness and the true

554
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:25,154
nature of interconnectivity and I think 
that the response to sort of the this 

555
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,030
was that knows anything.

556
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:36,050
The deer of capitalism has got to be a 
similarly potent and motivating idea and

557
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:37,274
your point that the fact that apple and 
Nike have to refer to in order to 

558
00:28:41,211 --> 00:28:46,211
motivate people to buy unnecessary and 
in some cases brilliant trainers is is a

559
00:28:46,701 --> 00:28:47,534
reference to oneness.
God's community profits with a Ph in 

560
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,150
that for me is will.
We have to go back to that source.

561
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:56,990
The answer is not,
you know,

562
00:28:56,991 --> 00:28:57,824
like for me like,
and I know next to nothing about 

563
00:28:58,881 --> 00:28:59,714
Marxism,
but it was the thing that sort of comes 

564
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:02,150
up a lot in this podcast.
Perhaps it's good to,

565
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,490
I keep saying it,
but when mark talks about alienation,

566
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,353
when he's talking about the spiritual 
problem of a mechanized and fully 

567
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:13,631
industrialized culture that is not 
controlled by its labor force,

568
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:17,540
that it's just that in itself is a 
problem of the spirit and the,

569
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:20,660
my personal frustration around the 
opponents of,

570
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,780
you know,
sort of like the,

571
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,623
the sort of,
the lighter side of the neoliberal 

572
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,033
project is unwilling to not backtrack 
but to embrace the spiritual side of 

573
00:29:31,851 --> 00:29:34,960
this because the new age stuff sounds to
me a bit sort of God,

574
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,440
not back crap,
but like,

575
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,274
you know,
but to recognize that there is room in 

576
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:41,230
this discourse for what is this,
what it,

577
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:42,340
that we're fighting for?

578
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,233
Why is it,
why did it matter that we're human 

579
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:45,364
beings?
Why does it matter that human beings in 

580
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:48,910
the planet is in trouble?
Who Cares?

581
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:54,060
How do we avert avoid nihilism unless 
it's with some deeper spiritual truth?

582
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,301
Well,
I mean,

583
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:01,134
I think there's a,
there's a little bit of a difference in 

584
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:05,904
North America than here because of the 
role of indigenous leadership in 

585
00:30:13,741 --> 00:30:18,670
progressive movements,
particularly in the climate movement and

586
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:19,860
in the environmental movement.
I mean,

587
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,920
every single major battleground against 
a new mine,

588
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,913
against a nuclear waste dump against a 
new pipeline is a fight that has 

589
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:33,020
indigenous people at the forefront.
Um,

590
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,990
whether this is true in,
in Canada where I live,

591
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:38,660
it's true in the United States.
Uh,

592
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,500
it's true in Australia and New Zealand.
Um,

593
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,130
and,
and in most parts of the world,

594
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,660
um,
it's true in India.

595
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,210
That's true all over Latin America and 
you know,

596
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,183
there are.
And so what's been interesting to me as 

597
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,100
somebody who,
you know,

598
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:56,934
I,
I come more from the economic side of 

599
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:00,780
the left,
Tino,

600
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:05,250
my early writing was all focused on 
labor and human rights,

601
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,080
less,
less so the environment.

602
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:12,770
But for the past decade or so,
I've been very immersed in,

603
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:13,843
in the climate movement,
which I think is deeply interconnected 

604
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:17,454
with all of those other issues.
And I find it really exciting to watch 

605
00:31:21,691 --> 00:31:26,691
the ways in which settler movements,
movements of,

606
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,943
of nonindigenous people are being 
impacted by exposure to an indigenous 

607
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:38,390
worldview that has the oneness that 
you're describing at its center,

608
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:41,220
right?
Um,

609
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,323
you know,
if you're fighting a pipeline at 

610
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:47,520
standing rock,
you are fighting that pipeline according

611
00:31:47,521 --> 00:31:50,610
to the rules of the community there.
And they have the rules up,

612
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,693
uh,
you know,

613
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:56,750
on the side of the various structures in
the camp that say you are in ceremony.

614
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,520
This is not,
we are not protested.

615
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:01,620
We are protectors.
We're water protectors,

616
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:06,180
meaning we are protecting living systems
that protect all of life.

617
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,103
And when we march up to the police sign,
that is an act of ceremony that is not 

618
00:32:12,421 --> 00:32:13,500
an act of protest.

619
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,540
Right?
Um,

620
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,620
and it's,
um,

621
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,190
and,
and it creates,

622
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,043
you know,
one of the interesting conversations I 

623
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:21,960
had at standing rock and every chapter,
but this in the book,

624
00:32:21,961 --> 00:32:24,370
but I didn't describe this,
um,

625
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,670
conversation.
There was a,

626
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:31,790
a guy of a poet who I ran into there and
he'd been in many different left spaces,

627
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:34,674
protest spaces.
And he was just talking about how 

628
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:36,924
different this was,
and one of things he said was really 

629
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:40,724
different was that he said,
every movement that I've been a part of 

630
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:43,784
has fetishized use and this,
this idea of just sort of perennially 

631
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:50,930
starting over and just kind of hating 
old people.

632
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,240
Whereas this is a culture that respects 
wisdom,

633
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,770
hard won wisdom of elders,
not to say all older people are right,

634
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,663
but that there was,
it was a deeply intergenerational 

635
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:06,080
movement that,
that young people were at the forefront,

636
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:08,610
but elders were,
were,

637
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,780
were teachers and leaders as well.

638
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,833
Um,
and it's just one of the ways that I 

639
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:17,450
think the culture of the left is slowly 
changing.

640
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,000
I think that's really important.
What you just said.

641
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,760
I don't have a hood that before I was 
aware that the,

642
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:23,763
a pipeline,
a ceremony ceremony instead of protest 

643
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,020
and immediately you,
her,

644
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,350
instead of protests,
protests,

645
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,890
that's really good because you're 
denying the conventional lexicon,

646
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:37,724
which is what frames is.
You'll just protesting against this 

647
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:41,234
natural progressive thing that's 
supposed to be happening rather than 

648
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,330
we'll protecting.
Yeah,

649
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:45,164
you're coming from a place of love.
You're coming from a place of love for 

650
00:33:49,581 --> 00:33:53,570
this land,
for these living systems that no one can

651
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:56,030
do without.
And um,

652
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,890
and,
and yes,

653
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,830
in order to do that,
you have to be against something.

654
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:01,664
You have to be against this pipeline 
that is threatening the only source of 

655
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:05,780
drinking water for this community.

656
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,790
But it's not driven.
It's a,

657
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:08,624
it's a,
it's a sort of a constant reminder that 

658
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:12,950
it isn't hate that is dry.
It doesn't,

659
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:17,300
hatred of these oil companies are,
although,

660
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,860
although there's anger there and,
you know,

661
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:20,780
and there was opposition there,
um,

662
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,590
but the but it,
but it's serving this broader love.

663
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:24,990
And,
and,

664
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,890
and this is one of the things that,
you know,

665
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,720
people ask me stuff,
how do you,

666
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,980
how do you stay hopeful and all of this 
in the movement.

667
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:31,814
And I think the reason why that question
comes up so much is because so many 

668
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:38,420
people who are in spaces of opposition 
or kind of pickled in anti,

669
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,590
you know,
in,

670
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,930
in that space for understandable 
reasons,

671
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,970
right?
But in these,

672
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,833
her frontline environmental battles,
they really are so often about 

673
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:55,150
communities falling more deeply in love 
with the place,

674
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:55,820
you know,
with,

675
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,530
you know,
maybe it's their coast,

676
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,401
um,
you know,

677
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:01,700
understanding how dependent they are on 
the streams and,

678
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,520
and,
and oceans that surround them.

679
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,103
And,
and learning about the interdependence 

680
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:09,914
that was always there before,
but which we were ignored in our little 

681
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:13,124
bubbles.
So the contingent of the culture that 

682
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:21,191
has become prevalent that we live in the
from dislocation is a dominant idea that

683
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:24,590
you have no integral relationship to 
your land.

684
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:28,310
You don't mind,
is distinct and superior to environment.

685
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,670
It is a resource for us to be used for 
us to use,

686
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,670
uh,
the challenge of,

687
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,370
again,
if these ideas are stitched into ancient

688
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,203
cultures,
what else is there in there that we are 

689
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,293
the gate in?
What else in there are we neglecting 

690
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,480
wherever it's,
oh,

691
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:46,314
mindfulness is good for your heart or we
are one with our environment or the 

692
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:51,550
shape,
uh,

693
00:35:51,551 --> 00:35:52,384
the,
uh,

694
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,600
gay in marginalizing and humiliation of 
the Shaman by the settler cultures.

695
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:01,290
When hunter gatherer of packs were 
wrangled,

696
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,213
coiled and dis empowered.
So that cultures could be grounded so 

697
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:10,350
that the earth could be subjugated and 
our ability to live between realms,

698
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,380
to imagine new societies,
new ways of being like even by rejecting

699
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:18,010
the language,
drumming up,

700
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,570
drumming,
dancing,

701
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:23,840
these were all banned for indigenous 
indigenous drumming.

702
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,600
Got Rid of all

703
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,790
their ceremony,
their music,

704
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,050
which yeah,
kill the culture.

705
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:29,640
And it's happened again and again.
And who did we do it to?

706
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:31,470
The British bright.
Basically everyone that we,

707
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,370
the ones doing it.
Actually Irish dumped by my.

708
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,340
That was,
I just got.

709
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,173
We were trying to artist.
What about those lovely trains we give 

710
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:39,730
to the people of India?
They loved those trains come on.

711
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,130
And as a child,
what about culture?

712
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:45,350
Try and look at the tray about fish.
Newt.

713
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,223
Well,
if they're everywhere they'll be on the 

714
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:47,484
train.
Stop Moaning.

715
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,103
Yeah.
It's uh,

716
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,410
it's um,
I think this is important.

717
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,253
No,
me and I don't know quite how to make 

718
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:57,204
such a potent idea.
Palatable to secularized people without 

719
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:05,901
making it sound a bit crap and Hesi and 
don't do what you're trying.

720
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,640
I really am trying to bring some of the 
glory of God back into this,

721
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:13,680
a bit of fuel area,
bit of righteousness,

722
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,140
a bit of power,
a bit of archangel energy,

723
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,060
some flaming swords,
but like,

724
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:19,370
you know,
like nondenominational,

725
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:19,830
of course.

726
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:20,663
I mean I feel like every culture in the 
world should find what connects them to 

727
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:24,110
the land,
connects them to the one that's connects

728
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:24,944
them to one another.
And also I feel like I have to make it 

729
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,750
bureaucratic and political for a moment.
Why the hell not that.

730
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:30,584
How is any sort of centralized system,
any post Westphalian clap trap about 

731
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:38,150
nations ever going to work when people 
can't be tied up in a Daf flag anymore.

732
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,440
It's too bigger idea served its 
function.

733
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,453
Nationalisms broke globalization of the 
type that we've had so far hasn't 

734
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,340
Balderdash and has led to this 
reemergence,

735
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:48,174
hasn't it?
Of um,

736
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,240
trumpkins Pumpkin as I like to call him.

737
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,790
Well,
I mean this is,

738
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,550
this is,
I mean we have to figure it out in a,

739
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,600
in a big hurry because we,
you know,

740
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:03,770
the climate clock has striking midnight.
We don't have a lot of time to,

741
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,260
to have a wakeup call.
It's interesting,

742
00:38:06,261 --> 00:38:08,210
you know,
when I was writing my previous book,

743
00:38:08,211 --> 00:38:11,070
this changes everything.
I mean,

744
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,180
my working title for that book was the 
message,

745
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,840
um,
because told you not to do that.

746
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,510
The problem is when you,
when you search on the message,

747
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:22,460
you just get all this Bible stuff,
you know,

748
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:25,160
I mean it's just,
it's just really creepy.

749
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,660
Um,
but,

750
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,970
but the idea,
the message,

751
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,213
but the message was going to be here.
Homework was going to be messages that 

752
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:38,660
climate change isn't an issue.
It's a message that is speaking to us in

753
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:39,494
the language of floods and fires and 
storms and it's telling us to wake up 

754
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:48,100
and it's telling us to evolve and it's 
telling us that this system is broken.

755
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,110
Right?
And I think we are in this,

756
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,020
at this moment of overlapping system 
failure.

757
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,460
Uh,
I think inequality is,

758
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,220
is an extraordinarily.
It just completely untenable levels.

759
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:05,020
I think thousands of people drowning in 
the Mediterranean is also a message that

760
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:05,854
this is completely untenable.
I think grenfell tower is a message and 

761
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:13,570
people are.
I think if there's some hope,

762
00:39:13,571 --> 00:39:14,404
maybe it's that people are understanding
more and more these crises are messages 

763
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:24,040
of system failure as soon as that fire 
happened,

764
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,903
right?
I mean,

765
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,690
it was,
it was understood as being so far beyond

766
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,620
this one building,
but an expression of all of these failed

767
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,580
ideas,
right?

768
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,703
Um,
and this and this failed worldview and 

769
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:39,160
the cruelty at the,
at the center of it.

770
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,830
Um,
so people are getting that in an instant

771
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:42,664
now.
Right?

772
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,960
So I think,
I think there,

773
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:48,580
I think that it is possible to have kind
of punctuated transformation,

774
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:52,510
these moments where suddenly things 
start changing very quickly.

775
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,820
Um,
and you know,

776
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:59,821
if we look at moments where there has 
been a radical progressive change,

777
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,390
it does tend to happen all at once.
Does it?

778
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:05,410
When did it?
Well,

779
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,890
um,
you know,

780
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,160
in,
after the,

781
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,790
in the midst of the Great Depression 
after World War II,

782
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,340
after depression,
do suppression,

783
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,760
new deal,
social security,

784
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,580
um,
after the second world war,

785
00:40:21,581 --> 00:40:24,430
public health care and yet,
um,

786
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,240
and,
and then the environmental law laws,

787
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:31,540
the legal infrastructure protecting 
endangered species.

788
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,430
I mean this,
this happened one like,

789
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,473
like just a flurry of laws,
the things with big responses to like 

790
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,610
everyone's fogged out,
you know what I mean?

791
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:41,920
Lots of luck.
I don't know much about what happened in

792
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:42,754
the Great Depression,
but then you think there was a huge 

793
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:44,870
number of people like,
oh,

794
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,753
we better start now because there's too 
many of them on my off the Second World 

795
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,330
War.
Oh,

796
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,870
we've just killed millions of people.

797
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,580
We better do something.
So it's like these things are like isn't

798
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,580
in a way while suicide,
numerous positive benefits,

799
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,820
just a way of power maintain in itself 
like centralized power going,

800
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:03,010
well this is the bare minimum we can do 
the bare minimum we can do.

801
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:03,903
There's just got a bit higher for a 
moment they're going to need to help 

802
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:06,334
service.
But after that we can probably carry on 

803
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:08,930
doing what we're doing,
isn't it?

804
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,850
What we actually need is a massive 
deconstruction of power.

805
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,863
Like isn't it like anything that.
Wouldn't it be good to have some big 

806
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:17,194
jazzy global campaigns?
I'm a very visually effective and 

807
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:22,580
potent.
Like we are going to destroy apple logo,

808
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,433
that kind of thing.
Like we're going to take one big 

809
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,770
corporation and we organize a global 
movement,

810
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:27,604
destroy.
It probably sounds a bit less popular 

811
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:29,404
and brilliant products got off that 
phone or gm or something where you can 

812
00:41:32,831 --> 00:41:34,100
say like that thing

813
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,880
that's digital,
you know,

814
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,760
so fruit globalize,
attacking of the brand,

815
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,560
protesting,
like just to demonstrate,

816
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,610
but at the same way like to demonstrate 
the potency of mobilization,

817
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,360
to take one,
one victory to one symbol,

818
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:50,000
one thing go right.
Why don't we attack that thing?

819
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:54,410
That was the plot of the TV show.
What was that hacker show?

820
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,110
Russell branch.
Was it what Mr.

821
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,303
Mr.
Robot.

822
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,690
Mr Roberts said what happened?
Did it go well for Mr.

823
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:07,450
Robot was the second series of Mr.
Robot,

824
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,293
get back to me.
Tell me if the revolutionary idea of 

825
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:12,620
bringing down one massive bluechip 
corporation works.

826
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,970
Not Easy.
A good idea,

827
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,893
Naomi.

828
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,270
I mean I was interested in your 
conversation with geodes about just,

829
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,163
you know,
where is the power and the being in 

830
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:26,594
these rooms filled with supposedly 
powerful people in the power isn't 

831
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:29,744
there,
you know?

832
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,640
And,
and yeah,

833
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:32,474
I think if,
if people could see a deconstruction of 

834
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:37,970
one of these symbols of what he calls 
the deep state,

835
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,510
it,
it could be quite empowering.

836
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,540
But I also think it can,
I think this spell of powerlessness,

837
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:48,284
I mean this,
this extreme era of corporate power 

838
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:53,300
that,
that,

839
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,540
that in most parts of the world is 
called Neo liberalism.

840
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,310
I mean,
that really is dying.

841
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,263
And,
and,

842
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,920
or is it mutating,
do you think?

843
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:01,640
How do,
what do you,

844
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,870
what evidence is there a bit dying?

845
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:04,560
Uh,
it's,

846
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,453
it's,
it's a Zombie ideology because as it 

847
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:10,160
advanced,
this was it.

848
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,063
This was a project of ideas that had 
true believers that would sit down and 

849
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,580
earnestly tell you that if we 
privatized,

850
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,340
you know,
the,

851
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,620
the rails for energy and water,
good things will happen,

852
00:43:22,621 --> 00:43:23,880
right?
They will work better,

853
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:24,960
they will be cheaper.
I mean,

854
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,033
there aren't,
there's nobody left to defend 

855
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,610
deregulation,
privatization,

856
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,370
low taxes and cuts to social spending.
It's,

857
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,223
it's stumbling around.
And I think you accurately described as 

858
00:43:36,211 --> 00:43:38,250
kind of a Zombie ideology,
right?

859
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,113
Because it has its own momentum.
But this is why we're in this very 

860
00:43:42,691 --> 00:43:43,524
dangerous moment because there is a 
vacuum of ideas and these very 

861
00:43:46,471 --> 00:43:47,304
dangerous,
right wing white supremacist type or 

862
00:43:49,741 --> 00:43:54,741
misogynist ideas are surging represented
by the donald trumps of the world.

863
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,120
And the meeting the pens,
there's enough of them.

864
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,130
Or is it because we live in bubbles all 
day?

865
00:43:59,160 --> 00:43:59,993
All I'd ever meet him.
I never made people who actually 

866
00:44:01,231 --> 00:44:03,210
sincerely go.
Now he's a that Donald Trump.

867
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,460
I never meet them or they just say,
don't say out loud.

868
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,210
What's going on?
Well,

869
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,260
they're,
they're out there.

870
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,340
They're out there in the voting.
Well,

871
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,593
I mean,
I think the forces that he's tapping 

872
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:17,040
into never went away.
He didn't create it,

873
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:17,950
right?
Um,

874
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,580
but,
but this vacuum is potent.

875
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:21,443
It's dangerous,
but it also is filled with 

876
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,330
possibilities.
And um,

877
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,253
and so,
and I feel like it's this very slow 

878
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:33,020
decomposition,
this slow and the part of the neoliberal

879
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:37,990
project that is slowest to die is not 
the policies we can.

880
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:38,851
I mean,
look,

881
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:39,684
I was on the BBC this morning.
We were talking about the fact that the 

882
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:47,520
Tory government here is talking about 
abolishing tuition fees.

883
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,670
I mean,
there's nobody left to defend austerity,

884
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,160
but the.
I think the,

885
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,073
it turns out that the piece of it that 
was sturdiest was there is no 

886
00:44:58,291 --> 00:44:59,520
alternative,
right?

887
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,953
More on the imagination is what 
outlasted the policies themselves and 

888
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:06,114
that's what starting to lift because you
have this whole generation of young 

889
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:09,564
people who didn't get the indoctrination
that you got and that I got because 

890
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:14,424
their whole adult life is post 2008 
financial crisis when all the true 

891
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:19,434
believers fled for the hills.
They are still trying to oppose brutal 

892
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:25,830
imposed brutal austerity on Greece and 
Spain.

893
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:26,873
But there's nobody out there saying this
is going to be good and don't you dare 

894
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:31,270
think anything else.
Right?

895
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,460
So they're free.
They're much freer than we were.

896
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,103
They never got the hard sell on 
resentment and I think I'll give him a 

897
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:43,180
bit of an indoctrinating myself.
No,

898
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,790
I mean,
what do you mean by the inner trump?

899
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:46,170
What do you mean by the trump within?

900
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,190
Well,
I mean this comes back to,

901
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:51,423
you know,
this idea of treating trump as totally 

902
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,690
other.
And when I,

903
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,220
when I first started working on this 
book,

904
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,103
I just happened,
I was at a literary festival and they 

905
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,600
seated me next to a real Hillary Clinton
Democrat.

906
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,160
Um,
and,

907
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:09,910
and I explained the book I was working 
on and you know,

908
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:10,763
trump as sort of the,
the logical conclusion of all of these 

909
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:16,014
trends.
And she was sort of nodding along and 

910
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:19,211
then I,
you know,

911
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:19,831
I said,
you know,

912
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:21,750
this is,
this is,

913
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:23,760
these are American trans.
And she was like,

914
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:25,530
no,
it's not like we're Obama,

915
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,483
you know,
and she wanted to just completely 

916
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:30,060
disavow trump,
you know,

917
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:33,090
that he was,
it was only red states.

918
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:34,350
It was only the,
right.

919
00:46:34,351 --> 00:46:37,300
It had nothing to do with the broader,
the,

920
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,510
sorry,
the broader culture.

921
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,230
Um,
so I just don't buy it.

922
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:44,123
I mean,
I just see him as just this 

923
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:48,870
manifestation of everything that is 
going wrong in our culture.

924
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:51,190
Just this for our fractured attention 
span.

925
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:56,190
The fact that he doesn't read just the 
word,

926
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:58,680
give it to me in a list.
You know,

927
00:46:58,681 --> 00:47:02,120
Alyssa is what he's,
he's,

928
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:07,870
he's a good.
Is growing punishment.

929
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:11,150
Make another list.
That'll be a good experiment.

930
00:47:11,151 --> 00:47:11,660
Well,
uh,

931
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,720
don't do things that run shorter list 30
things that room

932
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,323
that is fascinating,
but he is symptomatic or not that 

933
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:20,723
because how could it be otherwise?
I mean like what people's unwillingness 

934
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:28,320
through revise the Obama presidency 
because not now obviously comparatively,

935
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:30,250
superficially,
personally,

936
00:47:30,251 --> 00:47:32,770
he seems like some sort of gorgeous 
Christ.

937
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:38,010
But actually what he was doing was 
laying the foundations for what happened

938
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:43,380
subsequently because you can't ask trump
if what happened before it was nice.

939
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:44,211
Oh,
and you know,

940
00:47:44,211 --> 00:47:45,770
I think with the,
part of the,

941
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:46,604
part of my argument that is,
is most uncomfortable for American 

942
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:51,323
liberals is,
is the argument that I don't think we 

943
00:47:55,101 --> 00:47:59,250
could have trump without Bill Clinton 
and bill gates because the,

944
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:04,460
those two men more than any others 
fostered this idea that billionaires are

945
00:48:04,671 --> 00:48:05,850
gonna save us,
right?

946
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,780
We don't have billionaires are countries
doing it.

947
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,910
Richard Branson,
he was going to fix climate change right

948
00:48:13,911 --> 00:48:15,760
in his spare time.
And um,

949
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,130
and Bill Gates is going to fix malaria 
and we don't need,

950
00:48:19,131 --> 00:48:19,964
you know,
he had bill gates now has more power 

951
00:48:21,111 --> 00:48:22,520
than the World Health Organization.

952
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:22,980
No,
me,

953
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,780
I went to this island,
Richard Branson's island,

954
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,400
right.
You owned it.

955
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:33,720
It was in the British Virgin Islands.
It was a tax haven and on it there was a

956
00:48:33,721 --> 00:48:34,554
symposium being held that was about how 
are we going to make the world a better 

957
00:48:38,811 --> 00:48:42,800
place and one of the things I said so 
while on the island and which expediated

958
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:46,760
by hasty departure by teddy atlas,
lower like one.

959
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:47,893
This is a tax haven in it.
Why don't we just live like operate 

960
00:48:52,381 --> 00:48:53,214
within the.
Even the existing systems will be 

961
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:55,554
slightly better than this one and my 
friend actually said like during the 

962
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,440
eighties when everything was whoosh 
crash,

963
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:02,250
Bang,
Wallop,

964
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,083
Richard Branson was bombing about not 
air balloons and speed boats and 

965
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,800
everyone's shitting themselves.
He's like,

966
00:49:07,801 --> 00:49:10,280
I don't know,
perhaps we should legalize drugs and you

967
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,114
know,
have a sort of a bit more concerned for 

968
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:15,540
the environment,
which is again an attempt to rebrand,

969
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:20,570
cooperate and appropriate the conscious 
energies of an awakening people,

970
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,240
but of course trump is intimately 
connected to a Bama,

971
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:25,074
to Bill Gates to Bill Clinton because it
is one interconnected system that's 

972
00:49:27,661 --> 00:49:28,494
feeding off itself.

973
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,360
Now the other risk we have is getting 
like,

974
00:49:30,361 --> 00:49:31,194
you know,
wandering into what our call with love 

975
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:34,590
and affection,
the ICC paddock,

976
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,620
where David Eick,
we're like,

977
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,613
like were sort of like if you've talked 
to much about sort of interconnected 

978
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:43,050
global systems that feed each other,
hold each other together,

979
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,740
have operated for a long time.
People's,

980
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,470
let's go,
hang on a second.

981
00:49:46,471 --> 00:49:50,190
This is a big crack pot.
So I'm very much value research based,

982
00:49:50,191 --> 00:49:51,024
empirical,
secular sounding data because I think 

983
00:49:53,641 --> 00:49:54,474
it's vital to be taken seriously,
but somehow there has to be a marriage 

984
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,213
between this sort of,
this academic data based researched 

985
00:50:04,291 --> 00:50:09,291
proper academic staff and the power of 
interconnection with people,

986
00:50:09,421 --> 00:50:13,170
the ability to stir viscerally human 
beings,

987
00:50:13,171 --> 00:50:15,390
to make them die,
live,

988
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,070
love,
sacrifice,

989
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:20,370
which they're not going to do for 
academia.

990
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,290
I think you,
I think you're right.

991
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,180
I think you're right.
And,

992
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:27,383
and I,
we live in a beautiful moment where 

993
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:31,900
these words worlds are converging.
Uh,

994
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,013
and you know,
I think that what we're learning from 

995
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:38,900
science is intensely beautiful and 
spiritual.

996
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:43,040
We talk about it as if it's something 
dry and remote.

997
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,980
Um,
but this is the study of life.

998
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:47,340
Yes,

999
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,300
but because I suppose that that in 
itself got colonized.

1000
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,950
The idea of scientific,
uh,

1001
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:52,784
endeavor became mechanized.
The way that's the most research is 

1002
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:57,100
funded is like,
if you look at the,

1003
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,340
where the funding comes from,
who's,

1004
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,350
who does the grail serve,
who does the grail serve Naomi.

1005
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,380
Now my producer,
he's not my producer.

1006
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:07,243
He's a free independent human being who 
happens to be producing this show is 

1007
00:51:10,281 --> 00:51:14,450
holding up a bit of paper that says No.
Basically whiteboard says change.

1008
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,100
Or I come a normally we can do this 
together.

1009
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,260
Resistance,
black lives matter,

1010
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,540
recapturing the imagination.
And if he's not,

1011
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:23,390
imagination isn't recaptured by my 
religious ranting.

1012
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:24,224
I thought that was wrong with him and 
Naomi's leap manifesto that's covered 

1013
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,680
these topics before you go off to your 
next appointment,

1014
00:51:30,681 --> 00:51:31,514
probably the mainstream media little 
snip your words of wisdom into some 

1015
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:39,830
actually meeting with some black lives 
matter activists about Grenville Tower.

1016
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,753
Oh yeah.
This is my cell out appointment of the 

1017
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:45,070
day.
This and that.

1018
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,940
It's not true with an entered Martin 
this morning.

1019
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,313
There you go right there.
So it's in a way you're creating 

1020
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,490
steadily more authentic,
you know,

1021
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,333
you to talk to other black lives matter,
you're gonna have to commune with pure 

1022
00:51:54,021 --> 00:51:54,854
consciousness.

1023
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:56,721
No,
I,

1024
00:51:56,721 --> 00:51:57,650
I,
I,

1025
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,073
I think what that is a reference to as a
section in the book about the fact that 

1026
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:08,750
social movements really are recovering 
the utopian imagination,

1027
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:12,050
really dreaming and public,
not just being an opposition.

1028
00:52:12,051 --> 00:52:12,884
And one of them most inspiring examples 
of this is the movement for black lives 

1029
00:52:15,981 --> 00:52:17,300
and in the,
in the United States,

1030
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:21,710
which came up with this policy platform 
called the vision for black lives,

1031
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,300
which is,
it's a,

1032
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:27,530
it's a political platform without a 
political party.

1033
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:28,783
It's,
it came out about through a very 

1034
00:52:31,311 --> 00:52:36,080
participatory grassroots process.
It is the,

1035
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,173
it is a response not only to police 
violence though though it is that it 

1036
00:52:41,811 --> 00:52:45,620
covers everything from abolishing 
prisons,

1037
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:49,190
the war on drugs,
restructuring the tax system,

1038
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:51,680
reparations for slavery.
And it's very,

1039
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:52,514
very bold.
And this is what we haven't seen from 

1040
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:56,780
progressive movements is coming together
and saying,

1041
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:57,220
well,
what,

1042
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:01,180
what does the world look like after we 
win a vision?

1043
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:02,283
Um,
and this is why I say the last piece of 

1044
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:08,530
the neoliberal project to die is this 
war on the imagination and the,

1045
00:53:08,531 --> 00:53:12,410
the leap manifesto is it is a project 
that I've been involved in in Canada,

1046
00:53:12,411 --> 00:53:15,020
which was an attempt to do this a couple
of years ago.

1047
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:20,021
We helped host a meeting of 60 movement 
organizers from a broad cross section of

1048
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:22,400
movements,
indigenous rights,

1049
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,200
food justice,
climate,

1050
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,610
labor,
uh,

1051
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,950
some,
some faith organizations coming together

1052
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,980
and just trying to agree on the yes.
And,

1053
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:33,843
and,
and what was so interesting about that 

1054
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:38,100
at meeting was just how hard it was to 
be honest.

1055
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:39,660
You know,
that that muscle,

1056
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:42,630
we didn't have a muscle memory of 
agreeing on what we want.

1057
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,170
We had a memory of coming together to 
oppose things.

1058
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:48,930
We'd come together to say we don't want 
this free trade deal.

1059
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,120
We hate this politician.

1060
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,340
We don't want this austerity bill.
Um,

1061
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:57,330
but we did not have experience of like,
well,

1062
00:53:57,331 --> 00:53:59,220
what does it look like when we win?
What is,

1063
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,920
what do we,
what do we agree on about what the world

1064
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:02,754
should look like in the future?
And one of the things that we had to do 

1065
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,613
was not rely on some easy nostalgia of 
just like this idea that everything was 

1066
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,414
great in the 19 seventies because the 
indigenous people in the room and the 

1067
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:18,300
people representing immigrant 
organizations in the room,

1068
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:19,134
we're just having none of that.
Like we're not romanticizing the 

1069
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:22,254
seventies.
So we're going to have to gain our left 

1070
00:54:26,461 --> 00:54:28,380
movements have done that for far too 
long.

1071
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:30,720
Right?
So we're going to have to be inspired by

1072
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,930
a world we haven't seen yet.
We haven't created yet.

1073
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,071
Um,
so yeah,

1074
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:37,140
if people are interested they can go to 
the leap.org.

1075
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,090
I'm interested and I'm a people and I 
include the whole manifesto at the,

1076
00:54:42,091 --> 00:54:43,680
at the end of the book too.
It's not long,

1077
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:45,960
it's 1400 words.
If people are rewriting it,

1078
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:49,500
that some people are using it to run 
slates of candidates to take over.

1079
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:52,520
City Council will use that.
And it's just,

1080
00:54:52,521 --> 00:54:53,354
you're not waiting for a politician to 
come along and figure all this out 

1081
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:58,703
because I think we are in a moment where
people are maybe a little vulnerable to 

1082
00:55:02,371 --> 00:55:06,870
save yours.
And a lot of trouble because,

1083
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:07,500
let me tell you this,

1084
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,333
but by the way,
my joke about your Messiah tour is not 

1085
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:12,280
finished.
It's a long shot.

1086
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,330
It's people like you who I worry about.
I don't know.

1087
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,890
That's a bit of archive that's going to 
get pulled up in 20 years.

1088
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:23,100
Here's Naomi Klein is fueled in a brand 
archive is a.

1089
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,700
don't call me that in public.
No,

1090
00:55:27,701 --> 00:55:30,070
sorry.
So okay.

1091
00:55:30,071 --> 00:55:33,070
I think the main things I've learned 
from this conversation and really,

1092
00:55:33,071 --> 00:55:37,150
really enjoyed was allowed to miss him.
I lot the idea that we got the twitching

1093
00:55:37,151 --> 00:55:37,984
Zombie corpse of capitalism lunging 
about now lashing about all baffled and 

1094
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:45,640
confused and bereft of ideas that 
there's a necessity for New Vision.

1095
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:46,623
And I think that we got from Naomi 
client and what you were saying about 

1096
00:55:48,921 --> 00:55:49,754
like some of those protests we have 
indigenous people is a reimagining of 

1097
00:55:52,241 --> 00:55:56,380
interconnectivity and oneness,
which previously has been regarded.

1098
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,320
The terrain of what I noticed you call 
faith organizations.

1099
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:00,243
I think more of them kind of summarize 
where people diverse people to come up 

1100
00:56:02,411 --> 00:56:07,411
with an opposing on subsequent vision.
He's a real powerful.

1101
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,003
I like that and we're going to look at 
leap dot Org and learn more to see if 

1102
00:56:12,071 --> 00:56:13,840
people can run that.
Watch out for.

1103
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:15,240
Don't follow leaders.
Watch your pocket.

1104
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,083
Me Watch out for Messiah Masonic figures
that some of the other things we've 

1105
00:56:18,251 --> 00:56:19,084
learned as well.
Is it?

1106
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:24,190
Yep.
I'd have free people like don't point

1107
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,140
is rude to point and say you enjoyed 
that big bucket of customers.

1108
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:31,990
Just stop complaining.
Naomi about Britain.

1109
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,470
We've opened our doors to you.
We've shared.

1110
00:56:34,471 --> 00:56:37,360
Knew nothing but love.
That's Naomi Klein there.

1111
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:40,030
Thank you for being such a wonderful 
guest as always.

1112
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:41,170
Thank you.
So that was fun.

1113
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:45,100
That show was sponsored by me and my 
rebirth to the next couple of shows.

1114
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:45,940
As I've said,
it's sold out,

1115
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:47,430
but if you want to go and see me and 
grim.

1116
