1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,260
Given that your person who tells stories
in the way that you do,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,863
it's not like people just liked guns.
Why is this idea so irresistible to 

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,820
American people?
Why?

4
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:11,980
Why isn't it like,
you know,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,610
like you see sort of like a speech after
sandy hook or wherever.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,633
And is that all right?
That's the day now where we don't have 

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,020
guns anymore,
but it's just like,

8
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:20,410
no.
Why?

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,990
Why is this so powerful?
What does it mean to their,

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,853
which is a,
which is an excellent question and I 

11
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:35,260
guess one of the best ways to explain it
would be,

12
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:36,094
and you touched on it there in terms of 
tapping into some core things about how 

13
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:40,744
America feels about itself.
They've got nothing to do with guns but 

14
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:45,760
work quite well with guns.
So,

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,550
um,
when I used to go to the NRA,

16
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:52,030
I went to a couple of NRA convention,
the National Rifle Association,

17
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:57,031
which is the gun lobby and the vibe,
like weird,

18
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,610
weird.
I'm kind of,

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,820
um,
so a lot of white guys,

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,600
that's the kind of 90 percent of the 
demographic,

21
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:08,660
probably more,
although they're trying to push guns in,

22
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,573
in more in women's direction,
so lots of pink guns and nice things 

23
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:17,120
that you can carry your gun in and kind 
of ways to look pretty with your guns,

24
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,970
stuff like that.
But um,

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,200
um,
lots of white guys and it almost kind of

26
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,150
almost sexual relationship to these,
to these weapons,

27
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:28,984
you know,
they're kind of the stroking them and 

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,513
kind of,
you know,

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,610
the,
the,

30
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,480
the,
the,

31
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,580
pouring them basically.

32
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,590
And I would really play up my 
englishness in these things.

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,300
I mean,
first of all because it,

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,833
you know,
it helps and secondly because it 

35
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:47,254
mitigates the blackness.
But you throw me now and I'm like 

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,330
Downton Abbey coming out of your mouth,
you know,

37
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,520
from Steven and I've got another puff 
daddy.

38
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:05,670
I'm looking at Puff Daddy,
but I'm hearing Downton Abbey.

39
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,250
If I could explain stevenage too,
then that would sort everything out.

40
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,080
So every,
most stevenage is a shitshow.

41
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,703
You can continue with your prejudices.
Crazy in Essex to stevenage and I that 

42
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,410
understand this,
or rather I don't understand this,

43
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,500
I'm explaining it to me and to a person 
they were off to the races.

44
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,980
They'll say,
are you married?

45
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,473
Do you have children yet imagined 
someone broke into your house and they 

46
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:34,714
wanted to rape your wife and kill your 
children and take everything that you 

47
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:40,900
worked for what you're going to do.

48
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,193
Uh,
you can,

49
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,440
uh,
waiver sticker them.

50
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,310
You're going to call the cops and wait 
for the cops to come,

51
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,240
or you're going to defend your family 
and defend what you meant.

52
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,510
And so it speaks to your kind of 
masculinity.

53
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,940
Homestead,
a small government individualism,

54
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,170
a notion of kind of might being right,
defendable shows.

55
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,360
Now the reality is,
well,

56
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,190
there are several kinds of facts that 
contradict that.

57
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,670
Especially most people who were shot 
dead killed themselves.

58
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,443
Second day after that,
you're much more likely to be shot dead 

59
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:21,190
by someone you know,
someone you've done so well I should say

60
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:22,450
is,
are you married?

61
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,081
Yes.
Well,

62
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:27,820
watch out for your wife.
And so,

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,680
um,
they are,

64
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,160
um,
survey evoke these,

65
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,690
a very primal yes,
um,

66
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,750
things in the culture and when 
confronted with that,

67
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,860
if you start talking about background 
checks and um,

68
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,363
you know,
banning semiautomatic weapons and stuff 

69
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:50,664
like that,
it's not really a match for the basic 

70
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,630
ideas of American individualism,
small government masculinity and so on.

71
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,790
You're talking about tinkering.
We think so they,

72
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,683
they have a powerful narrative that they
can tap into and the gun control people 

73
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,653
done.
