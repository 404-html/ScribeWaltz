1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,310
If you are not part of the elite,
the elite,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,630
then whether you are being exploited or 
whether you are irrelevant,

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,180
I don't like those options.
I would.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,133
I would like to even increase smile,
but still there is a big difference 

5
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:18,630
between exploitation and irrelevance.
When you're exploited,

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,703
you're still powerful.
You are powerful as long as it to be 

7
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:26,400
exploited.
Parents in your rotation,

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,710
they need you.
I mean if you're exploited,

9
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:32,430
for example,
you can go on strike and they care about

10
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:35,340
it because they need you.
They need you to work in the factory,

11
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:37,890
have to serve in the army.
When you're irrelevant,

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,190
you are much less powerful,
irrelevant.

13
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:43,500
People can't go on strike.
I mean if they go on strike,

14
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,600
who cares?
Now you can't go on strike,

15
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:49,560
but you do need to organize now this and
this narrative that the glorification,

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,483
the narrative where the worker is 
central because their worker is 

17
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:54,060
necessary.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,013
This narrative is constructed out of 
politeness but mainly in order to 

19
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:04,110
exploit the worker and whilst you may 
have a personal sense of engagement of,

20
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:04,944
Hey,
I'm like that guy with a sheaf of wheat 

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,740
ain't live grand.
You still are simply a resource now,

22
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,883
but again,
you are an important resource and have 

23
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:18,510
purpose.
You saying on a spiritual level?

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:18,731
No,
no,

25
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:19,564
no.
I mean from the point of view of the of 

26
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:21,794
the political and economic system,
you are important and the fact is they 

27
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:26,574
do invest in you.
Even if you live in a place like Nazi 

28
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,050
Germany,
as long as you're not a Jew or something

29
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:34,830
like that,
Hitler would invest in your health,

30
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,960
in your education,
would build sewage systems in,

31
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:42,961
in the slums because Hitler needs you 
eventually to work in the factory and to

32
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:46,290
serve as a soldier in the Wehrmacht.
Otherwise,

33
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:50,910
Germany wants to be strong,
so even within fascism,

34
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,773
aside from the obvious things about 
fascism that that needs to be rehashed 

35
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:58,240
because they sound sort of evidently a 
bomb.

36
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,020
Annabelle,
the positive thing about fascism,

37
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:01,854
the ID,
the idea about us human beings 

38
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:06,900
functioning as a unit,
that is not a lie.

39
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,970
It's not an exploitation that's not 
exploitative in,

40
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:10,804
in the same way as a capitalist system 
exploits people by selling the 

41
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:15,450
deception.
Oh,

42
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,410
you know,
why don't we work?

43
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:18,180
It would be good when really it's 
entirely.

44
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,520
Your labor is a resource for us in 
fascism.

45
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:21,354
Isn't there a sense that there is an 
earnest belief that the included group 

46
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,683
are valuable?
It's not insincere and you're not being 

47
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,223
duped or product.
Hitler wasn't going those stupid blonde 

48
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,830
blue eyes.
He means he means it.

49
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,070
It's sincere.
Oh,

50
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,010
that's a big question.
I mean,

51
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:42,060
it's,
when you look at the fact is it's really

52
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:46,050
a myth,
but certainly there is a domain,

53
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,640
the sincerity of fascism or the 
sincerity of fascism,

54
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:51,474
of really caring about the individual 
German housewife and her children are 

55
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,983
just a means to mobilize population to 
suit the needs of the powerful in the 

56
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:02,740
end.

57
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,840
I mean,
you see it in fascism like in,

58
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:06,310
in,
in many other regimes.

59
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,683
And um,
and of course there are always the 

60
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:13,330
excluded excluded ones.
Fascism in order to function.

61
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,960
Fascism always needs enemies.
And traitors.

62
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,500
My list of potential ideas,
again,

63
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,580
there is a lot of misunderstanding about
fascism,

64
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:29,581
which is I think one of the reasons you 
see a real resurgence of certain fascist

65
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,454
tendencies to danger for.
One of the misunderstandings is that 

66
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:35,320
there's a kind of romanticism for the 
inclusive group and if you have enough,

67
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:36,154
this is just the opposite,
that I think that when we tried to and 

68
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,023
after the Second World War we were,
it was a central theme in every 

69
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:46,420
education system in the west,
uh,

70
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,510
to warn people about fascism.
But I think we,

71
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,373
we didn't do a good enough job because 
we presented fascism as a kind of 

72
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,940
monster and we vilified.

73
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,873
I mean,
we didn't explain what was attractive 

74
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:05,440
about it.
And what was attractive about fascism is

75
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:08,020
that he told people,
you are,

76
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:10,300
if you belong to the group,
to the right group,

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,820
you are the most important thing in the 
world.

78
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,890
You are the most beautiful thing in the 
world.

79
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,630
When people looked in the Fascist Mirror
in the 19 thirties,

80
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,650
if a German in and looked in the mirror,
he did not see a monster.

81
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,710
He sold the most beautiful thing in the 
world.

82
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,693
This is why it was so attractive 
comparable to the worker in the wheat 

83
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:31,864
sheaf propaganda poster.
You have an identity that is meaningful 

84
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:35,254
to your culture.
Your individual identity has value in 

85
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:38,704
the collective identity,
whether that's your area and looking in 

86
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:45,430
the mirror or your a communist,
toiling in the field or factory.

87
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,290
You have purpose.
You have meaning.

88
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,124
They seems to be a resource that's 
important when organizing society or 

89
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,070
system.

90
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,300
Yeah,
and and you know,

91
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:52,650
it,
it,

92
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,170
it,
it,

93
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,003
it,
it flatters people and people like to 

94
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,410
hear that sort of a human resource,
isn't it?

95
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:01,390
I mean when we're looking at.
It's difficult,

96
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:02,224
isn't it,
when talking about extremist ideologies 

97
00:05:03,421 --> 00:05:08,421
such as fascism and communism as we've 
experienced it because as you just said,

98
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:12,880
we extract,
we extract from.

99
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,050
We don't include what must be attractive
about it and there is nothing wrong with

100
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,870
people feeling purpose or valued in the 
collective.

101
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,260
There is something wrong with people 
persecute in an but.

102
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,510
But,
but because we made this,

103
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,380
we wanted to warn people about fascism.
We did it.

104
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,710
We didn't really explain what was 
tempting about it.

105
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:34,780
Why do people go after it?
It's a bit like,

106
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:37,410
you know when,
when I read Harry Potter,

107
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,250
when I watched star wars or things like 
that,

108
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,084
they always make the same mistake that 
they depict the bed guys is just 

109
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:49,240
terrible and ugly and repulsive and then
are left with the sense,

110
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,220
why would anybody follow voldemort?

111
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,520
Why would anybody follow Darth vader?
These guys,

112
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,070
they are ugly.
They are mean even to their own.

113
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,970
There are mean and cruel and then you 
don't understand what is seductive about

114
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:02,804
the dark side and the thing is the dark 
side is very seductive because for the 

115
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:10,550
people in it,
it's very beautiful.

116
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,170
Again,
you look in the mirror,

117
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,210
you see the most beautiful thing in the 
world.

118
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,193
This is something that you know,
traditional Christian art understood 

119
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,333
much better than modern science fiction.
You mean that the devil would be 

120
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,780
beautiful.
The devil is beautiful.

121
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,070
This is.
Otherwise,

122
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,933
who would it be tempted.
So now we have an intelligent oration 

123
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,500
that grew up with the idea of fascism is
the ugliest thing in the world.

124
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,693
And then when,
when they start to adopt fascist ideas 

125
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,550
and they look in the mirror,
what the CS,

126
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,393
not a monster,
what they see is something very 

127
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,010
beautiful.

128
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,380
And then they reached the conclusion we 
can't be fascist.

129
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,131
Yes,
yes,

130
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:48,230
I understand.
When you want people to be vegetarian,

131
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,720
it can't.
You can't say bacon tasted awful.

132
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,673
You have to go look.
Bacon's great where we just can't eat 

133
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:55,430
it.
You okay?

134
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,380
And the same with drugs.
Look heroin,

135
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,903
a lot of fun,
but I'm sorry we can't take care of in 

136
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,110
anymore.
It's off the agenda and what?

137
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:05,450
Those things are resourced by.
His pleasure,

138
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,100
pleasure,
power.

139
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,040
These energies are attractive or these 
ideologies,

140
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,720
they move through our consciousness.
No,

141
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,020
they all have at some point interacted 
with human consciousness.

142
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:16,850
They are an expression of our 
consciousness.

143
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:17,684
They seem to be universal's.
There seem to be perennial themes that 

144
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:21,650
are emerging.
We want to belong to the collective.

145
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,680
We want to feel valued.
We want to feel purposeful,

146
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,910
antithetical.
In fact,

147
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,783
the dystopia that you're describing 
where a useful class will vein flight 

148
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:35,000
and to an unmanageable degree,
isn't it?

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,640
Then when we're looking at the systems 
that have failed and the systems they're

150
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,520
succeeding and what we have learned and 
what we're beginning to understand,

151
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,013
it isn't our obligation to begin to 
present alternative ideas that somehow 

152
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:50,114
embrace these ideas of purpose,
a essence and where possible throw off 

153
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:02,140
the imaginary shackles of the systems,
preexisting requirements I eat.

154
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,613
Your value is as a worker.
Every single one of us in this room 

155
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,960
right now is here because of our value 
as a worker.

156
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,670
You May,
Jenny,

157
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,800
every single person he is being paid to 
be here,

158
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:14,870
right one way or another.
And like,

159
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,713
you know,
well you love your husband got your 

160
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,753
husband's in the room,
but you've already made these come up 

161
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,220
all the best buy beers.
So like,

162
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:23,054
you know,
but like none of us or like the most 

163
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:28,130
important things in my life are not my 
values as a man doing a podcast.

164
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:29,150
It,
my children,

165
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,580
my wife and all human beings know this,
that,

166
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,640
that love is something that can be 
realized through work but need not be.

167
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,930
And often is it.
