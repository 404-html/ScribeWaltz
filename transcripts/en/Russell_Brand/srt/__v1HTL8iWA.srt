1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,013
You are listening to Russell brand on 
under the skin with me today is my 

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:06,330
guest,
Mr Vice President Al Gore.

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:08,340
Thank you for coming or thank you for 
having me.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,583
It must be straight.
There's a what's your film and I loved 

5
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:13,410
your film.
Whenever you come into a room,

6
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,244
everyone stands up.
Is that standard even like you get 

7
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:18,990
standing ovations before joke's been 
delivered?

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,080
Well sometimes,
sometimes it seems to be the case in the

9
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:22,914
film.
Now I just do establish it so that you 

10
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:25,614
don't feel obligated and tense about the
promotional aspect of what this 

11
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:30,744
interview must contain.
I think it is important for people to 

12
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:34,974
see this film an inconvenient sequel 
speaking truth to power because for me 

13
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:39,684
it rendered the issues of our global 
ecology in a way that was easy to 

14
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:44,784
understand.
Made it clear that there is an 

15
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:50,010
imperative that we act now,
but also there's great cause to optimism

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,380
that there are shifts both from right 
wing thinking.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,213
People like your man at the end near 
that sort of our lovely mayor who 

18
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:56,064
shifted in Georgetown,
which is I think sort of like the 

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,760
bullseye of what you would call 
conventional republicanism and also the,

20
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,520
the politics can be functional and 
effective.

21
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:06,354
That's what I got from the,
your activity at the Paris climate 

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,193
conference where you're able to put 
together that deal with a solar energy 

23
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:15,300
company in India who may have reneged on
a,

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,560
on a,
on a sort of,

25
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:18,660
on the Paris climate agreement,
little Doobie.

26
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,494
No.
Then it will be the United States there 

27
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,114
would renege on that deal anyway.
So like I think it's an important film 

28
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:26,820
for people to see.
One of the things that struck me,

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,733
uh,
Mr Vice President was the way that you 

30
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:34,320
appear to be guided to some degree by 
your spirituality,

31
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,243
by your faith.
Much of it was like words like mission 

32
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:40,900
that you see as a personal mission and 
uh,

33
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,260
also that some of the language is 
somewhat biblical,

34
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:46,500
unavoidably because of the scale of the 
ecological disaster we are facing.

35
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,363
How do,
how does your spiritual perspective 

36
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:52,860
inform your mission to affect global 
ecology?

37
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:53,900
And our attitude towards it.

38
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,361
Well,
first of all,

39
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:56,194
thank you so much for doing this 
interview and for putting so much 

40
00:01:58,721 --> 00:01:59,930
thought into it,
Russell.

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,200
Um,
I don't wear my spirituality or religion

42
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,063
on my sleeve,
but it is a core part of who I am and 

43
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:12,814
this is a,
an issue of biblical scale in the sense 

44
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:17,554
that the future of humanity could be at 
risk where we not to grab hold of this 

45
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:23,584
crisis and solve it.
The good news is that we are beginning 

46
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:28,420
to do just that,
but,

47
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,283
but there is so much at stake you,
it's really essential to put it in the 

48
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:38,080
context of will we have a future or not?
Again,

49
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:40,780
I'm convinced we will,
but uh,

50
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,843
this is not the normal issue.
We're now seven and a half billion 

51
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,120
people.
Our technologies are incredibly powerful

52
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:53,860
and we have to wrestle with our 
vulnerability to short term thinking and

53
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:58,780
greed and behaviors that don't really 
move us forward into the

54
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,350
future,
which are indeed spiritual

55
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,120
issues.
Greed is a spiritual issue.

56
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,103
One of the things I was struck with time
and time again because greed is to 

57
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:09,230
prioritize personal need over social 
need or fraternity,

58
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,560
the Brotherhood of man,
the collective is a spirit.

59
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,340
These a spiritual issue because 
individualism,

60
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,320
I was clocking Betsey's face in the 
background.

61
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm always scanning rooms is why I live 
on Mr.

62
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:21,770
Vice President.
I liked saying Mr Vice President,

63
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:22,604
by the way,
it's an enjoyable thing for person to 

64
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:24,944
say.
Often I have professors and doctors in 

65
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:28,150
here and yeah,
I'm touching a little licks,

66
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:31,770
social climbing lik spill.
I get to use the term like they,

67
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,340
it feels my own sense of grandiosity 
now,

68
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,560
right?
If we live in a world where a conceptual

69
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:37,394
and a fictitious idea such as economy,
he's prioritized over an actual factual 

70
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:43,970
and material ideas such as ecology.
What hope do we have?

71
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,600
How?
How can we change people's conception,

72
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:50,870
conception of ecology when we have a a 
generation of people,

73
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:54,530
there've been schooled in consumerist 
capitalists thinking,

74
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,080
how are we going to unpick that inner 
generation?

75
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,500
Do you think the economic arguments such
as solar panels are cheaper,

76
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,240
will be a sufficient tool to unpick 
generations of indoctrination?

77
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:07,880
People they've been taught to think like
capitalists.

78
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,660
Well,
I think that the,

79
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,583
the rapidly declining cost of both solar
and wind and now electric cars and now 

80
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:19,810
batteries and sustainable agriculture,
forestry,

81
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:23,710
fisheries,
these new techniques will help us,

82
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:24,544
but I think you're right that the 
emphasis on mass consumption as a 

83
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:34,741
pathway to happiness is definitely a 
part of the issue.

84
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,560
You and I probably disagree on the role 
of capitalism per se,

85
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,060
and I don't want to get sidetracked too 
much into that.

86
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,053
I want to think it is a sidetrack 
because how is it that people can ever 

87
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:50,874
think of the world as their home in the 
way that you generally do with your 

88
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:57,810
affectionate rather beautiful attachment
to that image of the earth,

89
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:58,644
that first photograph,
when people clearly see the earth as a 

90
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:04,890
resource culturally,
economically,

91
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,560
and I think on a deep philosophical 
level,

92
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,860
if people see the outside world is 
something that can be consumed,

93
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:13,980
relationships that consumed commodities,
they're consumed ideas,

94
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:14,814
media,
they're consumed without a fundamental 

95
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:17,094
insignificant shift.
How can you hope to achieve such an 

96
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:21,600
ambitious and goal?
Thanks mate.

97
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,800
As saving the world.
Yeah.

98
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,030
Yeah.

99
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,870
Well I do totally agree with you.
Uh,

100
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,390
the,
uh,

101
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,530
we need a shift in consciousness and we 
need,

102
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,413
uh,
a a keen awareness of what we're doing 

103
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,070
to the earth.
Uh,

104
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,390
and,
but,

105
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,600
but I do want to tell you about my views
where capitalism is concerned.

106
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,093
I believe that the alternatives to 
capitalism in some form or explored in 

107
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:50,184
the 20th century,
both on the left and the right and they 

108
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:57,090
were found to have some,
some serious problems and excesses.

109
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,210
But capitalism in its current form I 
think is in need of serious reform.

110
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,450
We need to start putting a price on the 
so called externalities like pollution,

111
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,860
also the positive externalities.
A,

112
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:10,694
we count investments in education and 
mental health care and treatment for 

113
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:16,970
addictions and community services as as 
an expense.

114
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:20,810
And then we ignore the benefits of those
expenditures.

115
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:24,380
So that's a distortion that needs to be 
remedied.

116
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,190
We don't account for the depletion of 
natural resources and we should,

117
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:31,790
we ignore the growing inequality in 
incomes,

118
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,430
which is threatening the future of 
democracy.

119
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:35,110
If we don't

120
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,540
up.
Yes,

121
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,050
because built into the economic model 
under which we labor,

122
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,920
there is no potentiality for the 
inclusion of crisis right now.

123
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:46,790
The failings of the ideologies of the 
last century and all their extremism and

124
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,300
the war and the have a good they rigged 
for me,

125
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,153
does not put a full stop on the 
potential for new systems and evolve in 

126
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:55,910
systems and merge in national socialism.
Terrible,

127
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:58,040
terrible idea.
Communism as practice,

128
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:58,874
particularly Soviet communism,
which really repeated the model of the 

129
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,860
czar ism that proceeded it rather than 
being a legitimate,

130
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,773
you know,
Soviet experience where power wasn't 

131
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:08,780
paralleled and equalized.
I,

132
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:11,420
you know,
clearly a huge failure,

133
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,540
but that doesn't mean that it doesn't 
need to be huge shifts.

134
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,374
I'm thinking of,
I've heard this quote and I want you to 

135
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:17,054
think about it.
It's by this man called a Sateesh Calla 

136
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,480
east.
When he spoke to Bertrand Russell,

137
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,314
who obviously in the late sixties was a 
prominent campaign for nuclear 

138
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:25,340
disarmament and he said,
what's the point in getting rid of these

139
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:28,160
nuclear missiles if we don't change the 
consciousness that invented them?

140
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,993
Because people will continue to manifest
these kinds of tools and these kinds of 

141
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:35,630
weapons.
Something about that stays with me,

142
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,643
that what you seem to have experienced 
personally is a transformation in the 

143
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:42,974
way that you see the world now.
How much impact can be had politicking 

144
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,583
at the Paris climate to get India to 
accept solar power only for the u s to 

145
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,160
renege on it because of individualism,
consumerism,

146
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,340
materialism.
A platform that's been laid for 50 years

147
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:00,920
for Donald Trump.
Donald Trump didn't appear in a vacuum,

148
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,460
although there seems to be one inside of
him and it like,

149
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,850
so like,
you know,

150
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,330
so I think that,
how do I think we have to be to a key to

151
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:09,710
the kind of thing that you want to 
achieve?

152
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,693
I think that there needs to be a 
transformation on an individual level 

153
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:14,390
that is quite,
quite profound.

154
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,170
Yeah,
I think that's true.

155
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,620
I think that there are fundamental 
truths about human nature that are going

156
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:26,340
to cause both problems and 
opportunities.

157
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:31,341
Whatever political or economic system we
find ourselves living in.

158
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,330
I have always had immense respect for 
those,

159
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,850
uh,
for the founders of the United States of

160
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,683
America because they were humanists who 
separated religion from politics and 

161
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:48,180
actually took into account some of these
truths about human nature.

162
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,950
And I'm a British citizen.
Lord acton said famously,

163
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:56,130
power corrupts absolute power corrupts 
absolutely.

164
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,233
And putting boundaries around the 
accumulation of too much power by a 

165
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:02,694
single individual or a small group of 
individuals either in the political 

166
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:10,770
system or the economic system is a 
recipe for danger.

167
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:11,604
And one of the problems we have this,
one of the reasons we have this climate 

168
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:14,964
crisis is that the large carbon 
polluters have accumulated too much 

169
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,214
power to influence our politics.
And they distorted the conversation 

170
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:25,914
about climate by using their money to 
put out climate denial and create false 

171
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:35,451
stouts in exactly the same way that the 
tobacco companies did years ago.

172
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,390
They hired actors and dressed them up as
doctors and put them in front of cameras

173
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:40,224
to falsely reassure people that what the
doctors had found out about smoking 

174
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:44,364
cigarettes and lung cancer was not true.
And now the carbon polluters are doing 

175
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:49,650
exactly the same thing about the climate

176
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,703
except with a half a century of 
entrenched and funding for academic 

177
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:57,130
studies.
So now they don't require actors because

178
00:09:57,131 --> 00:10:00,220
the whole thing is theater.
The whole thing is a play.

179
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,210
And when you talk about the potency of a
utility monopolies,

180
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,403
uh,
Mr Vice President Al Gore long name to 

181
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:11,320
say continually,
Oh you can accuse al just now.

182
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:14,860
It's actually happened.
Your adequacy if you want to be proper,

183
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,010
your adequacy for is that,
that's a formal okay.

184
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,200
Instead of your activist.
Sweet hell is fine.

185
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,870
Cause I for a minute,
for a minute,

186
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:25,600
you were laughing at their rigmaroles of
English culture,

187
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:26,920
Your Highness.
Uh,

188
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:29,480
I mean we have a title over here by God.
Um,

189
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,903
so yeah,
like for a person that's been vice 

190
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:34,294
president,
the United States in a period in which 

191
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:36,724
many of the economic decisions that have
led to the kind of entrenched monopoly 

192
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,613
utility monopolies that we are on the 
Asian American now there's this suffers 

193
00:10:44,381 --> 00:10:45,790
is a pap test or you're a fair word to 
you.

194
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,500
You know,
you were there.

195
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,333
Yeah.
So I've heard it said before that a lot 

196
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:50,201
of people said,
oh,

197
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:54,100
I left parliamentary left Congress so I 
could focus on politics.

198
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,360
You know,
because you know,

199
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:56,194
Yanis Varoufakis came in here once and 
he said politicians only have power 

200
00:10:58,571 --> 00:10:59,404
within the limitations of their role.
Did you find that when you were vice 

201
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:02,554
president,
the United States that your power was 

202
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:04,760
quite limited?
That the,

203
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:05,594
our ability to be effective,
particularly with their issues that 

204
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:08,860
you're passionate about?
Like ecology,

205
00:11:08,861 --> 00:11:09,694
we're limited because ultimately stay 
power is nullified by superseding 

206
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:16,270
economic powers and financial interests.

207
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,441
Well,
I think,

208
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:18,274
uh,
the skillful exercise of political 

209
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:21,484
power,
which includes the mobilizing of public 

210
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:26,044
opinion,
can bring about to more potential for 

211
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,590
change then perhaps in any other 
position.

212
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:38,070
But one of the limitations of working in
the White House is that you cannot focus

213
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,880
only on one issue.
You have the responsibility to focus on,

214
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,013
on many.
And one of the luxuries that I have now 

215
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,913
is the,
the freedom to focus almost exclusively 

216
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,380
on the climate crisis and elements of 
the crises that are connected to the way

217
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:59,500
our news media operates,
the way our economic system operates.

218
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,663
But I see it almost exclusively now 
through the lens of the climate crisis 

219
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:05,960
say and,
and I think we,

220
00:12:05,961 --> 00:12:07,700
we have to make it the top priority.

221
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,790
I agree with you,
but is that sort of a moot point?

222
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,743
Unless there is sort of powerful 
legislation on an international level 

223
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,600
that pre prevent or prohibits 
profiteering by these monopoly utilities

224
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,443
that you speak wouldn't affects,
let the call crises of our planet and 

225
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:25,454
say well the way the oil is refined,
the amount of profit these companies 

226
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,531
here,
like you said,

227
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:29,364
they're more heavily saturated.
Like traditional energy resources are 

228
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:32,164
more heavily subsidized and modern 
renewable energy times as what do we 

229
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:37,230
make that legal overnight?
Just like stop,

230
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,020
stop subsidizing.
It may go,

231
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:39,923
I,
it doesn't even require a kind of 

232
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:41,244
radicalism.
Cause when I see these apocalyptic 

233
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,360
river,
Lake Erie in the GS fires,

234
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:47,160
storms,
Filipino death,

235
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,323
then I think,
well it's not too much to ask to simply 

236
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:55,500
say right from the,
forget 24 or 2050 or so.

237
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:59,730
I'm a far flung title of a Kubrickian 
movie tomorrow.

238
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,310
No more profit in.
But these are not now.

239
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:03,660
That's not possible.
Is it?

240
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:05,400
Because the political and economic 
model,

241
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,870
which is in a way tissues is conjured by
the consciousness of man will not permit

242
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:12,090
it.
You can't make those kinds of change.

243
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,730
You can't say,
well there's no more GM anymore.

244
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,880
There's no Exxon Exxon's close reclaims 
it.

245
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,290
There was a famous economist who wants 
a,

246
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,303
uh,
things take longer to happen than you 

247
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:23,354
think they will.
And then they happen much faster than 

248
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,204
you thought they could.
And changes in consciousness sometimes 

249
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:32,450
take time,
but they can occur.

250
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,763
And this climate movement is very much 
in the tradition of previous movements 

251
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,150
that changed consciousness.
The abolition of slavery,

252
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:44,480
the granting of the right to vote to 
women,

253
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:47,810
the civil rights movement.
And in my country anti apartheid,

254
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,883
most recently the gay rights movement,
if someone had told me even five years 

255
00:13:52,611 --> 00:13:57,611
ago that gay marriage would be legal in 
all 50 us states and would be accepted,

256
00:13:57,861 --> 00:14:00,350
honored and celebrated by two thirds of 
the American people,

257
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,510
I would have said,
I sure hope so,

258
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:05,570
but I think you're being completely 
unrealistic.

259
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,463
But the climate movement,
like all these previous movements 

260
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,813
eventually gets to the point where the 
straw man or discarded and you see the 

261
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:15,164
central question,
which is a choice between what is moral 

262
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:18,434
and right and what is immoral and wrong.
And that's where we are right at that 

263
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,100
tipping point in the climate movement.
Now

264
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,680
I hear you well,
but prominent civil rights campaign.

265
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:29,514
And one said to me like power will 
always yield on civil rights issues 

266
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,240
eventually because ultimately it doesn't
affect their,

267
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,770
their,
their resources.

268
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,430
But when you go for money,
that's when you will face resistance now

269
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:41,781
and,
and,

270
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:42,990
and it to be,
um,

271
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,690
Penika eight while I was there have been
a huge success.

272
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:47,580
He's in civil rights in the last half 
century.

273
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,110
One don't have to spend too long on 
google to see that.

274
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,450
Right now we're talking about something 
where there is a huge ticking clock,

275
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,453
so I don't,
I suppose it's not like I want to 

276
00:14:59,151 --> 00:14:59,984
encourage his steria,
but I sort of sense that radicalism is 

277
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:07,130
required and you in your new 
transcendent role to a role as a kind of

278
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:11,360
global mench a bodhisattva of the 
climate movement.

279
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,543
Oh,
sort of uniquely positioned to spell 

280
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:16,190
out,
just like pauses the film.

281
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:16,701
I watched it.
I think,

282
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:18,290
my God,
this is a serious,

283
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,300
serious crisis and you're educating 
people all over the world.

284
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:22,270
You're doing a tremendous job.
Who am I?

285
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,080
I Amia celebrity to even question you on
this subject,

286
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:29,150
but my point is,
is this a type of a,

287
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:29,984
seems to me.
My intuition is so the recession and 

288
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,430
trenching corruption within politics,
the,

289
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,560
the financial industry has these things 
sewn up so deeply.

290
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,483
The ordinary people find this so hard to
have purchased that in each of the 

291
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:42,080
issues that you have said,
whether it's women's rights,

292
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,020
African American rights,
civil rights are partners,

293
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:46,610
but blood is spilled.
Great men are imprisoned,

294
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,550
women die in chains before anything 
changes.

295
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,970
Do we have this time with this 
apocalyptic issue?

296
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,720
Do we not have to evoke the day it is in
the demons?

297
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:59,930
Do we not have to speak to level people 
on the level of their deepest,

298
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:02,600
truest self about what kind of world 
they want to live in,

299
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,583
what they're prepared to sacrifice,
who they are prepared to confront and 

300
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:06,210
when,

301
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,860
no,
I don't disagree with that at all.

302
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:11,490
I think it is time for people to take 
action.

303
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:13,960
Absolutely.
And to uh,

304
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,990
I'm very proud my daughter was arrested 
in a protest against the new natural gas

305
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:24,210
pipeline network.
So you know,

306
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:25,044
times have changed when a parent says,
oh I'm so proud of my daughter was 

307
00:16:27,121 --> 00:16:27,954
arrested.

308
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,813
I am.
What does that say about authority when 

309
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:32,620
a parent is now proud that authority,
his challenge,

310
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,910
he says all authority is de facto 
corrupt toe.

311
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,063
No,
Donald Trump really is it just a 

312
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:41,560
grotesque exagrid exaggeration as the 
proceeding decades and no disrespect,

313
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:43,180
cause you took part in those 
administrations,

314
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:44,890
but without [inaudible] and without a 
Bama,

315
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,310
you don't get trump.
We were being coached.

316
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:49,144
We're being lubricated.
We've been fluffed and prepared for the 

317
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,190
trump,
for the trump thrust.

318
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:55,024
I don't know what to call it,
if phallic references seem somehow 

319
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:58,370
appropriate with that man.
But,

320
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,480
but like,
you know,

321
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,580
we've school,
we told people to be individualists,

322
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,610
we taught people to be materialistic and
consumers.

323
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,040
And now we're surprised when it's a 
selfish,

324
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,550
racist,
sexist precedent that leads the world.

325
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:08,870
Well,

326
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:09,703
I,
I would interpret that history 

327
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:11,894
differently from the way you do.
I think that there are a lot of good 

328
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:20,591
people trapped in bed systems,
but when you work for positive change,

329
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,690
uh,
sometimes there is a backlash.

330
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:26,840
And I think that trump represents of 
backlash.

331
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,780
I think that brexit represented of 
backlash.

332
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,290
I think that for a lot of complex 
reasons,

333
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,124
globalization,
intelligence added to automation of the 

334
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:40,850
growth of inequality.
There is a lot of unhappiness and unrest

335
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,110
about the stagnation of middle income 
wages for some decades now.

336
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:45,944
And the,
and a demagogue can take advantage of 

337
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:51,660
that and focus it in an irresponsible 
way.

338
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,110
But the next is of each and every one of
those issues.

339
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:57,810
Is it an economic system that will not 
yield power?

340
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,920
You know,
when we talk about,

341
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,783
oh,
how do we have this system is because 

342
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,440
the people that are dominant,
this system works absolutely fine.

343
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,940
Thank you.
We don't want to change it.

344
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:07,650
We don't care if the planet is 
destroyed.

345
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,210
We don't care if there is this,
the,

346
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,210
if there's economic inequality across 
the planet,

347
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,283
I would see brexit and trump as if 
forgive my language as a democratic 

348
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:18,690
population and saying,
fuck you to power.

349
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,520
In both cases you've not looking after 
us.

350
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,680
Why should we care?
Why should we care?

351
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,750
We've been taught that those limbs are 
different.

352
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:26,700
We've been taught that women are 
inferior.

353
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:29,100
We've been taught all this.
Talk about gay people.

354
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:29,934
Shepherd hit.
People are bored of hearing it because 

355
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,000
they've said for decade after decade 
they've witnessed power,

356
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:38,610
not com taking care of their interests.
I think that's right.

357
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:39,444
I think there are,
I think this wave of populaced 

358
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:46,251
authoritarianism is a response to the 
unhappiness and anxiety that people have

359
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:48,384
been feeling for quite some time,
but how do we bring change in spite of 

360
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:56,130
economic interests posing it?

361
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,233
Take one example,
the anti apartheid movement in South 

362
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,940
Africa.
You're talking about an economic,

363
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,060
a set of interests of posing that 
change.

364
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,343
That was massive.
Nelson Mandela said it's always 

365
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:10,704
impossible until it's done.
Oh and this kind of change comes about 

366
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:18,600
sometimes when the potential for change 
bills up,

367
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:23,630
pushing against a barrier that suddenly 
gives away and then you see a tremendous

368
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:28,440
change that people did think was 
impossible but eventually came.

369
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,260
Yes.
I think there's a generational aspect of

370
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:32,094
change as well.
I think the younger generation now is 

371
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:35,574
far more committed to saving the climate
than those in my generation and I think 

372
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:41,214
it's because they've seen that every 
night on the news is like a nature hike 

373
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:47,670
through the book of revelation and if 
the news media doesn't connect the dots,

374
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:48,504
then they connect the dots themselves,
they and their understanding that this 

375
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,900
change is essential.
It does require a new way of thinking.

376
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,733
I absolutely agree with that.
How do we bring that about or ranting 

377
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:03,420
and railing against?
It has its place working within,

378
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:06,600
and I'm not characterizing you that that
way Russell.

379
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,733
I myself have been characterized that 
way based on the film you ranting and 

380
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:13,014
railing guys think that has its place,
but patiently working within the system 

381
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:18,744
as it exists to try to,
you pull the levers and press the 

382
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:21,894
buttons and make the machinery operate 
in a more constructive way also has its 

383
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:26,350
place.
But Owl,

384
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,790
every one of these examples you give,
I can't help but think of an alternative

385
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:30,451
narrative.
You know,

386
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,970
Nelson Mandela,
he went down for 27 years.

387
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,720
He was prepared to kill and die for what
he believed in.

388
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,763
And ultimately I've think if we 
investigate it though the apartheid 

389
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,200
ended when the economic interests that 
were the benefit from a pied found a way

390
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:48,040
of maneuvering so that they couldn't 
maintain their power

391
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,113
with our pod.
And having been to South Africa 

392
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:53,230
relatively recently,
I didn't fancy being black.

393
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:54,370
They're much,
you know what I mean?

394
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:56,950
I didn't figure this would be a dotted 
line moving in and out of town shit,

395
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,230
but there's of people are still living 
behind barb wire,

396
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,283
you know.
Now with all the way from my limited 

397
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,280
experience,
it seems like what power does is what is

398
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:07,000
the bare minimum we can give these 
people what is the bare minimum?

399
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,060
So if we aim at bare minimum,
that's what they'll give us.

400
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,133
So for me it seems like what we should 
do is focus on radical annihilation 

401
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,440
overhaul and revolution and that way we 
might get some kind of parity,

402
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,660
some kind of justice.
So like,

403
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,420
do you not think like I understand that 
rule changes happening.

404
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,630
He know that solar power and renewable 
energies is better.

405
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,610
You're right,
you're 100% right.

406
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,563
So like why not focus on identify the 
obstacles and then make it clear that 

407
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:41,200
these are the targets.
Like these companies are the problems.

408
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,670
That's what I tried to do.
Attack.

409
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,790
That's exactly what I try to do is to 
focus

410
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,600
so on Koch brothers.
Absolutely.

411
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,750
So why,
what,

412
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,040
like why if you'd like a y con we have,
right.

413
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,580
Exxon now has to be nationalized.
It's already subsidized.

414
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,770
We were already paying for it.
So now we're going to own it.

415
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,420
Why can't you do that?

416
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,480
Uh,
you know,

417
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:02,314
part of the movie focuses on the 
investigation of Exxon Mobil that's now 

418
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,324
underway.
I hope they will be held legally 

419
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:09,904
accountable for the fact that they have 
financed climate denial as the Koch 

420
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:16,390
brothers have financed climate denial.
They,

421
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,253
they've tried to fool people into 
thinking like rises isn't real and now 

422
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:23,740
they're trying to fool people into 
thinking that the renewable alternatives

423
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:27,610
are not viable and real as well.
It's very insidious.

424
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,580
Yeah.
Stdz ncds and the consequence of it is,

425
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:32,980
I suppose maybe a law.
I am,

426
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,120
I see the world differently.
See,

427
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,280
I recently became a father.
I have a nine month old.

428
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,660
Congratulations.
Thank you man.

429
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:40,410
It's changed everything.
I'm so in love with her is incredible.

430
00:22:40,411 --> 00:22:41,780
What's her name?
Mabel.

431
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,740
I went for a walk over this morning in 
the fields near where we live.

432
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,753
I look at the tree,
I look at every time and I think about 

433
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,500
that.
Our connection to nature is absolute.

434
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,880
This is it.
Like,

435
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,743
and when you show the images you 
repeatedly do in your film an 

436
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:55,870
inconvenient sequel.
Wishing I wasn't,

437
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:56,351
you know,
music,

438
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:57,131
good title.
In a way.

439
00:22:57,131 --> 00:22:58,150
It's sort of ironic.
I like it.

440
00:22:58,151 --> 00:22:58,984
It's cool,
but it's got the word convenient cause 

441
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,120
Mary at apple now vice vice metta,
um,

442
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,103
like it makes me feel that we,
one has to nurture the inherent 

443
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:10,510
connection we have with this planet.

444
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,403
We have to personalize it.
All things have become commodified is 

445
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:14,644
very difficult for people that are 
struggling to see the significance of 

446
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,433
broad global issues when globalization,
whilst it is bought sort of a commodity 

447
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:25,870
revolution and we've all got wonderful 
phones.

448
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,670
Thank you very much.
They're delightful.

449
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,940
What it's also done is this turned us 
into a planet of consumers that C,

450
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,113
and this is why at the beginning of this
interview I spoke about spirituality 

451
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:39,040
because I think this is where the 
transformation must take place.

452
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:43,450
The way we regard the exterior world,
the way that we regard God ourselves and

453
00:23:43,451 --> 00:23:47,030
our role on this planet as you evidently
do as a servant.

454
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,133
You are obviously living in service now 
and other feeling that I will let you 

455
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:53,030
know if I dare piece of boulders to 
speak for most people.

456
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,250
I think most people think that 
politicians are corrupt,

457
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,263
people in positions of power are 
untrustworthy and manipulative lawyers 

458
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,473
and that we should divorce ourselves 
from power and and I think to have a 

459
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,124
person in your position who has been 
behind the curtain who must know things 

460
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:14,030
that if you uttered them out loud,
your life would be at risk.

461
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,450
To see a person like q embracing an 
issue in this way is very,

462
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:18,284
very heartening for ordinary people.
My hope is that we continue to 

463
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:24,883
aggressively pursue these issues and 
identify and target who the problem is 

464
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,290
aggressively.
Oh,

465
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,320
I agree.
I agree.

466
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,090
This is the time for for passion.
This is the time for people to mobilize.

467
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,933
I couldn't agree more.
I wish we had to for longer vice 

468
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:39,920
president Al Gore,
but I know there are many,

469
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:43,880
many people to speak to a that you've 
got a an important and busy schedule.

470
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,940
It's been really,
really lovely to have you here.

471
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,400
I respect you very much once.
I bet you weren't man,

472
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:50,983
the movie 340 theaters or this Friday 
and tickets are available at all of the 

473
00:24:57,771 --> 00:24:58,604
places you get them and then a week from
Friday it opens widely all across 

474
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:04,240
England.
Uh,

475
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,250
an inconvenient sequel.
Truth to power guys.

476
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,420
See you'll probably get more from it 
then a go a lot.

477
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,040
I watched it.
I was really enjoyed him.

478
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,430
He might feel guilty in popcorn like at 
certain points I might think,

479
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,750
oh no,
what am I doing with my life?

480
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:20,000
But it's an optimistic film.
You will learn from it.

481
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,150
I endorse this film.
I went and saw it.

482
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:24,100
And normally you know how you have to 
infuse,

483
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,153
interview someone important like you,
they force you to watch the film 

484
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,723
normally got a guy in any way.
Someone else watch it and tell me this 

485
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:32,234
one.
I actually went and saw myself and I 

486
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:34,670
enjoyed it.
Thank you.

487
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,773
Thank you for saying that.
And I like your relationship with your 

488
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:38,870
dog.
I like your cowboy boots.

489
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,890
I like,
I like a lot of things about you.

490
00:25:40,891 --> 00:25:42,890
Alcohol or thank you for what you're 
doing for the world.

491
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:43,730
Thank you for the interview.
