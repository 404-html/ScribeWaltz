Sophie scott is a British neuroscientist
and senior fellow at University College 

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,630
London,
research in the neuroscience of voices,

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,613
speech and laughter.
She's known for our public engagement 

4
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:09,224
work,
including performing standup comedy and 

5
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:13,460
was featured in BBC radio four program,
the life scientific.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,030
Her research investigates the neural 
basis for vocal communication,

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,000
how our brains process the information,
speech and voices,

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,990
and how our brains control the 
production of our voice.

9
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:27,290
It's made me really self conscious of my
voice that has now sophie professor.

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,760
Thank you,
Professor Sophie.

11
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:29,594
Sophie,
professor,

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,040
thank you for professor coming here and 
doing this interview with me.

13
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,050
I'm very grateful.
Thank you very much for inviting me.

14
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,123
I saw you on Jimmy Carr.
I'm a fan and indeed friend of Jimmy's 

15
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,770
and he'd done a horizon where he talked 
about the neuro,

16
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,270
the neurology of laughter.
Can you just summarize what you're doing

17
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:50,810
on that show because it will help me to 
do a show with you now.

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,583
Uh,
they came to me because I'm one of the 

19
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:55,660
few people researching laughter in the 
UK.

20
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,410
If you go onto,
um,

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,470
the major database of science papers and
you do a search on emotion expression of

22
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:03,970
fear,
you get back over 4,000

23
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:08,890
published papers on fear and if you do a
search on emotion expression,

24
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:10,710
laughter,
you get back 150 papers there,

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,450
just no papers in it,
did no research going on into it.

26
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,830
And so I was lucky that meant that they 
will know what else they could ask about

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,851
how,
you know,

28
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:20,370
how and why we laugh.
Um,

29
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,813
and that's something I've been looking.
I've been looking at it from a 

30
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:25,750
perspective of how,
how we communicate with each other.

31
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,260
And I got interested in positive 
emotions in communication.

32
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,070
And as soon as you start doing that,
you find that laughter is just weird.

33
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:36,010
It's everywhere.
It's continuously founding conversation.

34
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:38,020
People did much,
much more than they think they do.

35
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,230
And we coordinate it really nicely in 
conversation.

36
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:43,660
And interestingly,
if you ask people about laughter,

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,513
those what makes you love when you love,
they'll talk about jokes and comedy and 

38
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:49,330
humor,
but actually out in the wild,

39
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:52,840
most laughter is just happening in 
conversations and people aren't laughing

40
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,390
at jokes.
Let me do laugh at jokes and comedy.

41
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:56,224
People are laughing to show that they 
know each other and like each other and 

42
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:59,110
understand each other.

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,340
Oh,
you mean the social wild ocelot humans,

44
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,210
monkey,
human,

45
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:04,680
primate people.
Exactly.

46
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,491
So like,
yeah,

47
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,140
I do notice that.
I listened now for that sound.

48
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:10,080
And one of the aspects of laughter,
humor,

49
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,830
comedy and communication I'm interested 
in is the political discourse.

50
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,420
John cleese has it.
Brilliant thing.

51
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:20,421
I wonder if you're aware about a serious
and solemnity seriousness and solemnity.

52
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,323
He said like,
people prohibit the use of humor in 

53
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:23,814
particular areas of the public sphere 
because of its potency and its ability 

54
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:27,774
to disrupt.
And I've always found it interesting 

55
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:32,460
that with the emergence of political 
figures like Nigel Farrage,

56
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:36,450
Boris Johnson and date Donald Trump,
people that are sort of used a different

57
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:37,770
type of rhetoric,
uh,

58
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,750
kind of accessibility and a kind of 
humor.

59
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,703
But of course,
humor has always been a part of the 

60
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,080
political discourse,
if you know,

61
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:43,914
they,
they make jokes all the time in 

62
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:49,170
parliament and in Congress.
They use humor to make people like them.

63
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,470
And I always think the,
um,

64
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,413
some of the idioms around comedy or 
interesting make people laugh is a form 

65
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:55,614
of control.
What have you got to add to that 

66
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,583
bloating?

67
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,240
Well,
no,

68
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,073
I think you're right.
It's an incredibly nuanced behavior in 

69
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,614
adulthood and it,
it's interesting to think about its 

70
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:08,110
roots because its roots lie in play and 
play behavior.

71
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,240
That's what happened when baby's first 
laugh.

72
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:13,060
When the parents take a little more 
picky with people,

73
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:14,710
you could move with them and that all 
came out wrong.

74
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,230
Play peekaboo with them.
Then that's a,

75
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,060
it's a response to a playfulness.
There's no joke there.

76
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,750
There's no bigger structure.
It's a,

77
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,683
you know,
I understand you're engaging with me in 

78
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:24,994
this fun way.
And it's absolutely basic to pro or 

79
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,450
primates.
Mammals.

80
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:30,280
It's a map that's a mammal behavior 
play.

81
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,650
We understand that there are strata of 
behavior.

82
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:34,170
So there's one by via,
wherever you.

83
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,510
If I said I'm very offended by what 
you've just said on this podcast,

84
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,100
you would go,
you would recognize that as,

85
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:40,510
oh my God,
this is serious.

86
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,000
And then if I thought really,
you're absolutely gorgeous,

87
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,620
then there's sort of a sense of relief.
Yeah.

88
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,743
So lack of.
It's the acknowledgement that there are 

89
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:50,560
frequencies you saying and these 
frequencies are vocally expressed,

90
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,590
but they're real logically understood.
Another demonstrable.

91
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,513
Is it like something that's happening in
play that neurologically that is not 

92
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,040
present in serious in the communication?
That's a good question.

93
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:00,874
And I don't know.
I don't know if I can give you an 

94
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:05,530
equally good answer.
We know that,

95
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,423
um,
play is incredibly important to mammals 

96
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,374
as they're developing all mammals play.
And even if you grow up to be a 

97
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:13,534
completely a Social Predator mammal,
then you will see that would be like a 

98
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,730
tiger,
a,

99
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,250
yeah,
an old big cats.

100
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,473
Um,
or even now I'm going to explain this 

101
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,164
really badly paid.
Even if you'll grow up to be a very 

102
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,140
frightening mammal.

103
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,840
It never plays a,
um,

104
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,460
well it big cats.
I'm auteurs and that's not true.

105
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,420
What I'm doing this very badly.
Gorgeous.

106
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:39,190
Now please tell us what is it?
Good.

107
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,520
What is a good a printer that's not 
playful.

108
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,030
What about that gorgeous gorilla with 
night eyes?

109
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:46,750
I saw her on Gogglebox.
Well,

110
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,090
gorillas are a good example of they're 
not predators.

111
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:50,890
They're vegetarians,
but they are.

112
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,340
They continue to play throughout their 
lifetime like humans do.

113
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,870
Like artists do,
like dogs do.

114
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,410
Most mammals play in juvenile period and
that's when they're learning.

115
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:00,244
We've got these massive brains.
We have this extended period of being 

116
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:06,810
juveniles when we're training those big 
brains up and this is all mammals and we

117
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,010
we learned mostly play,
not entirely,

118
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:09,844
but that's one of the structures and 
then in adulthood most mammals stop and 

119
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,523
a handful carry on like our dogs auteurs
other primates doing this playful 

120
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:19,744
behavior and what you find is that a 
behavior like laughter starts having a 

121
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,330
relatively simple role.

122
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,550
It's social bonding,
it's playfulness,

123
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:30,370
and then as we get older it becomes more
and more complex tool.

124
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,310
By the time you were an adult and you're
hearing laughter,

125
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,620
it's almost like a hall of mirrors of 
interpretation.

126
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:36,454
Somebody.
It could be laughing because there 

127
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:37,654
helplessly laughing.
There could be laughing because they're 

128
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:41,530
embarrassed because they're frightened 
because they're trying to cover up being

129
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:42,364
angry because they trying to make 
somebody like them because they're in 

130
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:45,154
pain.
Studied all these different reasons why 

131
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:47,614
laughter starts to appear around you and
when you're in an interaction with 

132
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,420
somebody,
you're normally pretty good,

133
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,950
normally pretty good at reading that.
It's often when you're inhale,

134
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,883
after going on,
it's part of something that has maybe 

135
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:59,370
nothing to do that.
Okay,

136
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,800
what's.
What are they laughing?

137
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,430
Listen to them laughing and it seems 
those pigs,

138
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,630
they didn't even pigs.
What do they love?

139
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,723
What's going on?

140
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,790
Well,
actually even worse,

141
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,140
you think they're laughing at you.
You know,

142
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,123
because that's another thing.
Am I included in this lover and my 

143
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,210
explanation?
The love.

144
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,070
So it's,
it's.

145
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,470
You're always thinking about it.
It's always meaningful.

146
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,930
Even if it's got apparently nothing to 
do with you,

147
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:18,764
you will pay some attention to laughter 
and try and work out what's going on 

148
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,820
because it is such a meaningful 
behavior.

149
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,790
It's interesting that laughter is vocal 
but nonverbal.

150
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,360
That is sort of a sort of super 
linguistic is beyond language life,

151
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,363
it's what you look to to communicate in 
situations where language isn't of use 

152
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:36,410
to you to try to connect to people for 
it after.

153
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,710
Absolutely,
and in this it sits with a set of things

154
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:40,544
called non verbal emotional expressions 
which are more like animal calls and 

155
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:46,580
they are like speech.
So when I'm talking to you now I'm doing

156
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:50,240
something no other no other animal can 
do in nature I you,

157
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,020
we are.

158
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,853
When we talk to each other,
produce this incredible sound that 

159
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,033
starts down at a rib cage and we're 
making sounds at our voice box of them 

160
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,270
is shaped that with our tongue and our 
lips and our jaw and that's.

161
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,163
This gives us this sound literally 
unparalleled in nature and then when we 

162
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:06,890
are in a really pretty extreme emotional
state,

163
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:07,724
we don't bother with that at all and we 
just squeeze the air out and we make 

164
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:10,694
screams and grunts and sounds all 
laughter and they're really much more 

165
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:14,444
basic sounds.
I listen now sometimes when I'm talking 

166
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,070
to people to hear the sort of noises 
they make.

167
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,690
There aren't words like a sentence 
paragraph,

168
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,553
what are you doing?
Just up to there when he made that 

169
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,080
little grown.
It's weird,

170
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:29,950
isn't it?
It is odd and I know we signaling,

171
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,670
signaling,
glean availability,

172
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:33,980
power status,
what's going on,

173
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:35,370
professor?
There's that.

174
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,270
There's a rather unfortunately named 
term called back channeling,

175
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,120
which means,
Oh yes,

176
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,110
I know it fairly well.
I'm afraid.

177
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,010
I began back channeling on my 17th 
birthday,

178
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,980
never called again.

179
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,630
What it means is people show that their 
listing,

180
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,240
so they tend to make little noises they 
might make loves,

181
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,083
but they also make all sorts of noises 
just like I'm here and I'm engaged with 

182
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:01,810
you.
He's like,

183
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,643
icontact.
I'm using it to indicate that I'm 

184
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,263
listening.
I might also use it to indicate I'm 

185
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:07,900
ready to speak to.
Also,

186
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,640
you know,
we,

187
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,473
we don't sit and receive messages and 
then start emitting them at somebody 

188
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:12,974
else.
We we speak to be understood and we 

189
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:15,734
listened to show that we're following 
and that's making funny noises can be 

190
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,064
part of that.
It's extraordinary what's happening 

191
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,230
beyond the understood signifiers within 
language.

192
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:26,130
Is it,
you know,

193
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,630
whenever you hear that thing of like,
oh,

194
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,870
90 percent of communication is 
nonverbal,

195
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,343
how can it be if someone's doing a 
speech for a guy and we're going to be 

196
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:34,700
raising taxes by this amount.

197
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,090
You're not freaking my attempt.
Like those eyebrows you have.

198
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,140
So thinking the information,
what's going across,

199
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:43,970
isn't it?
It definitely is,

200
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:44,804
but it's,
it's interesting that as soon as you 

201
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:50,630
have a person talking to you,
there is never just the words.

202
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,930
There's always a voice.
Yes.

203
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,680
And you do get a lot of other 
information from that voice.

204
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,270
Um,
I was thinking about this this morning.

205
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,040
I was listening to the,
the sex pistols and that,

206
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,220
you know,
God save the Queen and that came out.

207
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:03,210
Everyone's like,
Oh God,

208
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,800
this is so shocking.
And they keep going,

209
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,390
oh no,
we love the queen.

210
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,910
And I don't think they might.

211
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,390
Yeah,
that's a loaded voice.

212
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,950
Exactly.
And that I was just,

213
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,193
you know,
pre pubescent at that time it seemed 

214
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:22,254
incredibly threatening because they 
definitely pretty certainly don't have 

215
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,314
the queen at all.
And it was all coming from how it's 

216
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:27,504
phrased and how it's being used in all 
the sound that's contributing to the 

217
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:30,624
noise that they're making.
So I came into this area working on 

218
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:36,090
speech.
I thought I worked on language.

219
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,330
That was what I would tell people.
I did languages well eat.

220
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,193
But even even that was made when I was 
started scanning brains and you could 

221
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:48,300
find all these brain areas that we're 
responding to,

222
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,233
uh,
the words that you understand and all 

223
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:51,834
the linguistic stuff there.
But you also got all these other brain 

224
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:56,610
areas that don't care at all about 
words,

225
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:59,460
but they absolutely care about someone 
saying it.

226
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:02,490
And of course they're always there if 
there's someone speaking,

227
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:04,060
there's a voice.
And as soon as there's a voice,

228
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:04,894
as another channel of information that 
you are processing really strongly and 

229
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:11,040
the brain cares at least as much about 
that as it does about the words in terms

230
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,180
of activation.

231
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,153
Because if I think about this,
if you were to suddenly be turned into 

232
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,790
an austere mail from like sort of the 
Ukraine,

233
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,570
who was just saying the exact same 
content to me in this world,

234
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,350
Russell,
of course love to bond.

235
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,380
I think having a totally different 
experience.

236
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,860
Of course there's all sorts of physical 
and aesthetic data,

237
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:36,923
but that,
that what is contained in the voice is 

238
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:41,980
communicating in a powerful way.
So the reason that I didn't understand,

239
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,320
oh,
90 percent of information is nonverbal.

240
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,183
It's because I'm precisely unaware of 
the way I'm being affected by sound 

241
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,760
because we don't know how to categorize 
it.

242
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:54,580
I mean it's language is about what's 
being said.

243
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:55,414
It's about distinction.
I'm saying this and not this and it's 

244
00:10:57,401 --> 00:10:59,680
easy to categorize and understand less 
easy,

245
00:10:59,681 --> 00:11:00,514
I suppose,
as these aspects of communication that 

246
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,560
are non not vocabulary.

247
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,590
You're super linguistic.
Absolutely.

248
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:12,000
They don't directly influence what your.
The words necessarily that you're saying

249
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,860
all the can interact with it,
but as soon as you,

250
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,320
soon as you hear a voice,
you've got a person,

251
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:20,160
you've got a good idea at agenda,
you've got a good shot is an age,

252
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,210
socioeconomic status,
geographical origins,

253
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,133
mood health.
That's very empowering and it's also 

254
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,273
aspirational.
People talk in a way that they want 

255
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,850
people to see them as like when I've 
been on the phone to my mum,

256
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,540
I taught like my mum for about half an 
hour afterwards and you know,

257
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,380
loved my mom,
didn't really want to sound like it,

258
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:48,420
but I'm showing all this stuff about our
relationship.

259
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:51,540
As soon as I started talking to her and 
all of us do that all the time.

260
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,070
I'm talking differently to you now 
because I'm trying

261
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,050
to project a particular.
What is it?

262
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:58,790
World?
I'm hoping it's competent scientists.

263
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,810
I'm hoping I'm probably landing on it so
much more.

264
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,000
Sophie Scott and so much more,
um,

265
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,873
what we're projecting onto the world and
the way that we want to be received and 

266
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:10,234
he's sort of laughter somehow a 
supplement to that or a disruption to 

267
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:13,894
that.
I think it's,

268
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,510
it can be both,
so a lot of the time it's something that

269
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:21,220
you're actively using to try and effect 
interaction.

270
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:22,054
So here's an example.
I was on the cheap last week and not 

271
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:25,894
particularly full tube coming away from 
Heathrow and there was a suitcase with 

272
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,624
no one anywhere near and I suddenly 
realized I was unattended suitcase so 

273
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,530
and there were empty seats by it.
So the,

274
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:34,470
how many happy,
you know,

275
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:36,310
they all know I'm gonna have to say 
something so.

276
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,503
Okay.
Right.

277
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,583
Excuse me,
Dan,

278
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,940
you know,
everyone,

279
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,773
people I'm with going,
oh,

280
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,310
she's going to say,
excuse me,

281
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,660
is this anybody suitcase?

282
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,340
And there's one right at the other end 
of the character goes,

283
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:46,061
Oh yes,
it's mine.

284
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:48,910
And she came there and I was,
she was saying,

285
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:51,160
oh sorry,
I didn't realize that become available.

286
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:51,701
And I was going,
oh,

287
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:53,950
don't worry.
We were both laughing to kind of go,

288
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,170
this is okay,
so I'm not telling you off.

289
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,940
No one's crossed with you.
It's all right here.

290
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,710
Signaling to each other.
This is cool.

291
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,553
This is absolutely.
We all have the external reference that 

292
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,300
an unattended bag could mean death and 
it's in that context.

293
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,393
I mean I have seen people get really 
told off or unattended luggage so you 

294
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,280
know,
we're both trying to make it clear we're

295
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:13,750
not doing that and she's also very 
sorry,

296
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,823
but in fact that is a really nuanced use
of laughter that people that that was 

297
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:18,660
not helpless.
Laughter.

298
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,050
I was not in any sense of mused entirely
to try and make it better,

299
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,250
less threatening.

300
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,920
It was an expression of a kind of 
relief.

301
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:27,800
Of course,
right?

302
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,440
They're sort of like,
because there's the process.

303
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,274
Of course,
if you go now this isn't a terrorist 

304
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:31,984
attack on the tube,
but also that your social interaction 

305
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:34,804
has not failed.
It has not been misinterpreted that 

306
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,020
you've successfully communicated,
Oh,

307
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,910
I'm another concerned person.
Yeah,

308
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,920
we're all good here.
And if people,

309
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,560
if that goes wrong,
of course love to can suddenly be really

310
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:47,230
inappropriate and you do encounter 
situations where people will be like,

311
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,861
what?
You think?

312
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,420
This is a joke.
You're laughing at me.

313
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,383
I hate that.
Like in Goodfellas or it's an awful 

314
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:54,280
moment.
It's that.

315
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,580
It makes your blood run cold.
It does happen quite a lot.

316
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,730
That's basically a continuum in my life 
ever suffered.

317
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,780
Let the rhythm section of my life is 
people going,

318
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,180
what?
You're trying to be funny mate.

319
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,190
What's that then?
And it's awful.

320
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,143
It's interesting that it actually in the
rhetoric of a violent conflict and we 

321
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:14,500
try them and expert like the sort of 
like what you're trying to be funny.

322
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,393
Do you think you're funny that that's 
sort of like a bit of language that 

323
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:18,600
comes up a lot,
isn't it?

324
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:20,610
Yep.
Because it's undercutting,

325
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,610
I suppose.
Of course humor is disrupting their.

326
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,453
Say there's a standard frequency of like
the Banal exchange of information with 

327
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:31,120
whatever independent personal 
inflections you have as your default.

328
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,960
Then humor is subverting that.
Oh right.

329
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,370
I'm in here too.
Good to introduce some sort of jackets,

330
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:37,204
spikes all of this.
And then another person for power can 

331
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:39,964
go,
no,

332
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,760
this isn't funny,
or I don't like that feeling at all.

333
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:44,380
I've made myself nervous just talking 
about it.

334
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,130
Quite a lot of the behaviors that we do.
Um,

335
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,900
light,
laughter and yawning,

336
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,030
blinking,
contagious.

337
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,060
Most of the blinks you do,
you don't need to do your blinks.

338
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,850
Blinks were blinking our lives away.
Pointlessly thing.

339
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,400
If you watch a baby,
they don't.

340
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,040
They don't do this because we should.
We learn contagious behaviors.

341
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:04,874
We learn to pick them up from people and
laughed is a really big one to watch my 

342
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,750
baby.
I do watch her.

343
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,260
She don't blink very much.
He's actually bloody exhausting.

344
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,470
She won't have any blinking,
but with laughter with the baby,

345
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,630
I noticed that.
Well,

346
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:17,464
yeah.
Well if I got turned around like that 

347
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,910
and stuff,
she loves all that.

348
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,773
Yeah.
She loves sort of monster play and 

349
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:23,280
biting and all that.
Not Hard.

350
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,163
Not they're not aggressive,
but it seems like that there is a 

351
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:26,504
function and it's.
And when I think about what is my 

352
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,223
impetus to initiate that behavior,
is it recognizing she doesn't yet have 

353
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:34,484
language,
but I want to feel bonded to her and I 

354
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,913
want to feel closeness to her and I want
to touch her and staff so that place 

355
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,930
seven,
the function of a,

356
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,860
of reiterating and compounding our 
connection.

357
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,290
Absolutely.
Isn't this very interesting.

358
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,190
It is quite striking that we laughed so 
early.

359
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,091
You know,
we,

360
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:55,670
we can cry pretty soon as soon as we're 
born.

361
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:56,504
You know,
humans are born about three months too 

362
00:15:57,201 --> 00:16:01,790
soon because of our massive heads and 
then around the time we would be born we

363
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,624
start laughing,
so probably it should have been there 

364
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:05,174
right from the outset and then ages 
later we start making other sounds and 

365
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,253
it's very interesting that the second 
thing that comes in is this incredibly 

366
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:16,811
potent positive vocalization because 
babies don't catch laughs from adults,

367
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:17,894
but the adults love when the babies love
and you start teaching them about it 

368
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:21,044
starts becoming an interaction and 
there's very nice evidence that well 

369
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:27,950
before babies are linguistic in any 
sense that they can speak at all.

370
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:30,710
They're probably understanding a lot,
but they can't do anything vocal.

371
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:31,963
They will pay attention to.
Their parents laughed and they will 

372
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:36,530
start doing things to make their parents
laugh.

373
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,873
Precisely because of this communicative 
linkedin is giving in this interaction 

374
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:43,220
that it gives you so long before you're 
having conversations.

375
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,890
Babies are using laughter as actively as
you're using love to now to,

376
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:49,400
to drive interactions with you

377
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,860
more efficiently.
In the case of my baby and me,

378
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:52,694
she's a very funny trial.
So like what I'm thinking then is that 

379
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,403
there is power in laughter,
there is power in laughter as a form of 

380
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:03,740
communication and barefoot comedy.
There is power in it.

381
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,783
So like I wanted to.
One of the things we've done some pre 

382
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,880
production here and that's very rare for
us.

383
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:12,860
We've got a like examples of politicians
using humor and uh,

384
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:13,694
I wonder if we can analyze this is part 
of our podcast because we are 

385
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:17,900
professionals now.
Cenk or you'll have to make sure that we

386
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:20,210
can hear it.
Maybe you can play into that mic.

387
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,430
What Mike is that,
that you're on Mike,

388
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,180
for what?
That,

389
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,020
what's that one?
Gower.

390
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,990
Does that make it go on?
You want to play in there?

391
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,670
But will we actually able to hear that 
in the room?

392
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,400
I wonder even growing.
They're just.

393
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:32,234
So the first one is the first person 
that's using humor is just sort of a 

394
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:39,260
comedy staple of the British political 
world.

395
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,333
It's Boris Johnson using humans to 
communicate 14 to try and bikes to 

396
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:48,010
Holland boomerangs to Australia sands 
exports of,

397
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,983
but we do still export wine to Italy and
I'm delighted to say Nigel farage to 

398
00:17:56,731 --> 00:18:01,731
America now.
Boris Johnson,

399
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,623
I think is a really good example because
I think he's one of the things that 

400
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:06,470
human does.
Izzy,

401
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,340
I think signals and awareness of another
seam of communication.

402
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,440
Like if you're like,
if you're using comedy,

403
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,453
you're sort of saying like,
I know that on one level we're having 

404
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:17,364
this discourse like eat there.
Boris Johnson is given a speech in some 

405
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:20,604
sort of context like business and 
economics species to the next selling 

406
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,540
sand to the Arabs,
which is a racist trope actually,

407
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,374
but he found a way of have taken out the
most obvious racism and making a dog 

408
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:32,670
whistle racism.

409
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,640
One of his great skills actually Boris 
Johnson and uh,

410
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,040
but it's like he's being deliberately 
humorous.

411
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,990
What do you think Boris Johnson is doing
there?

412
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,083
If I'm absolutely honest,
I think Boris Johnson is very carefully 

413
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,414
cultivated a kind of clownish persona to
cover up a tremendously powerfully 

414
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,533
interested in success politician.
He's there was a very interesting essay 

415
00:18:57,451 --> 00:19:01,110
by Jonathan Coe pointing out that Doris 
Johnson didn't used to be funny.

416
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:03,150
He used to be just the Pashto in the 
nineties.

417
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:04,100
It was this,
here's this,

418
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:04,963
here's this,
another privileged individual from 

419
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:07,110
Eaton.
And he was on,

420
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,650
have I got news for,
you know,

421
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,480
I remember that.
And the first time he was on,

422
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,950
um,
in his lap,

423
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,370
kept having a go at him about a phone 
call he'd had with the journalists could

424
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,060
turn to someone called diaries.
Gfi was trying to get the details out of

425
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:25,040
Johnson and Johnson doesn't get mad with
very well and his just would not come by

426
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,350
way from.

427
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,183
It kept coming back to Katelyn back to.
And in the end I think Paul Martin 

428
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,423
[inaudible] you got a bit bored,
made a joke about it and that was funny 

429
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,870
and the audience laughed and it somehow 
simultaneously got Boris Johnson off the

430
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:40,340
hook and somehow the laughter stuck to 
him not to pull them out.

431
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,010
And He'd actually made the joke that was
like Batman when Batman was in that cave

432
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:48,000
of bat and became Batman.
I'm funny,

433
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:49,410
man,
if I'm funny,

434
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,363
I don't ever have to reveal my mackie 
eventually in self interest and a huge 

435
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:57,960
political ambitions.
I can just laugh my way to the top or at

436
00:19:57,961 --> 00:19:58,794
least to the middle and that certainly 
what Jonathan Co makes quite a good 

437
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:04,350
argument for that which I think contains
a lot of weight and it certainly needs.

438
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,040
It points out that the laughter kind of 
surrounding Boris Johnson,

439
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,570
he understands very well.

440
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,403
He knows it's not a sign that people are
thinking deeply about his intentions 

441
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,593
kind of.
It becomes easy to teach them as a joke 

442
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,330
and then he can use to a certain extent 
and it's a double edge sword,

443
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,160
but you are licensed to do different 
things.

444
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:20,994
If people treat you as funny and that 
works for you and it can work against 

445
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:26,250
you and he's been very good at making it
work for him.

446
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,080
He really has because they're so things 
like,

447
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:31,020
you know,
those allegations about his private life

448
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:31,854
that blokey sort of lost his way out of 
sort of lots of contentious decisions 

449
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:35,514
made while mayor fancy sort of like he's
reverse or this brexit stuff and now 

450
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:39,414
he's repositioning as sort of an attack 
dog for the conservatives in this 

451
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:43,740
election with that.
So if I noticed,

452
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:44,574
he said that he's got beautiful.
I mean he's obviously incredibly 

453
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:47,394
intelligent man,
brilliantly inexpensively educated man 

454
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,310
and when he sort of contrived an insult 
like mutton headed mug one lot,

455
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:54,550
I think that's beautiful.

456
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,680
Bit of language is a really,
really good attack.

457
00:20:56,681 --> 00:21:00,490
And like all good comedies,
it's got a sort of a specific revelation

458
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,470
and a specific intent is a cervic and 
lacerating piece of language that.

459
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,170
And,
and I,

460
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,350
I feel that when he's doing that stuff 
that there's a great power in it.

461
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:11,831
Like,
you know,

462
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:15,280
I don't think we've seen the summit of 
Boris Johnson's Korea and luck on what's

463
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:16,114
happening across the water is an 
indication that there's this type of 

464
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,970
charm and charisma is a useful way of 
attaining power.

465
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,833
Django,
can we put up an American one now just 

466
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:30,220
for the purposes of keeping some balance
and I'll put that mic up again.

467
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,620
So this is what this is this Donald 
Trump being funny.

468
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,470
Obama or trump or Obama?
He was.

469
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:36,304
Well funny.
He's good because he's charismatic as 

470
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:39,730
all hell.
He's good looking.

471
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,670
I liked Bernie.
Bernie's and guy.

472
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,753
Apparently some folks really want to say
a pot smoking socialist in the White 

473
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:48,923
House.
We could get a third Obama term after 

474
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:52,214
it.

475
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,020
So Nice.
Nice little joke there.

476
00:21:58,021 --> 00:21:58,854
I mean that.
That's how.

477
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,380
I mean that's a scripted joke.
Obviously.

478
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:04,980
It's a very sort of clear where it's 
going.

479
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:09,480
Once he says pot smoking socialist,
it's playing on his own,

480
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:10,314
sort of like public awareness.
So I think Barack Barack Obama's isn't 

481
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,643
an excellent politician and he states 
mentally and humorous in a way that 

482
00:22:16,111 --> 00:22:19,170
doesn't diminish the state is I would 
say Boris Johnson.

483
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,150
He sort of pays a kind of an ethical 
price,

484
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:25,500
vichy mode that's just more perhaps more
to do political stance.

485
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,840
I think sometimes,
and I,

486
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:28,490
I'm,
I could be being unfair here,

487
00:22:28,491 --> 00:22:31,760
but the Nigel Farrage joke though was 
basically a not funny,

488
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:32,810
not funny,
not funny,

489
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,810
isn't funny.
You know,

490
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:35,890
we've,
we've,

491
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,430
you know,
people love audience.

492
00:22:37,431 --> 00:22:40,550
Laughter is highly sophisticated.
I don't need to tell you this,

493
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:41,384
but people will laugh.
People laughing as they do in 

494
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,450
conversations to show that they approve 
or they agree or they understand or they

495
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:49,280
remember or they've noticed something,
you know,

496
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,860
as much as it is to do with the 
movement,

497
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:52,360
and I'm definitely not saying it's not 
amusement,

498
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,203
but the knowledge of project was a kind 
of like a here is that in in the same 

499
00:22:56,991 --> 00:22:57,824
way people up until recently used to 
produce it and there's Donald Trump in 

500
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:02,620
itself is a punchline and larger.
Just a punchline.

501
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,463
Whereas the Obama joke and I fully 
accepted may well have been written for 

502
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:06,464
him,
his self depreciating and slightly more 

503
00:23:09,411 --> 00:23:11,210
complex in terms of the structure of a 
joke.

504
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,500
It's not just a,
here's a funny thing.

505
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:16,400
Will laugh at that.
I may be biased by as we all are,

506
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:20,360
when we're appraising humor about 
personal feelings here and that's it,

507
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:24,270
but I'm interested in Obama because in a
vocally he just,

508
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,050
he's,
he's articulate and he used his rhetoric

509
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,033
beautifully.
He's a beautiful speaker and he's April 

510
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,820
of capable of dropping into humor at the
right time,

511
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,890
in the right way,
in a way that it's done well.

512
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,550
So he kind of excels in how it uses his 
voice and he's made humor.

513
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:42,110
Part of that.
Although one of the things,

514
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,200
the things

515
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,033
he was also doing in that drug and this 
not stupid perhaps to do with your area 

516
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:45,794
of or certainly not mine,
but like he's also diminishing the 

517
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:48,974
seriousness of Bernie Sanders,
which I imagine the point that you made 

518
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,790
the point that I don't know when that 
speech was happening,

519
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:53,624
but clearly it was the point when they 
were undetermined on who would be the 

520
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,470
candidate.
Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.

521
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:58,304
And it's interesting that sanders is at 
that point used as the punchline of a 

522
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,780
joke.
So like,

523
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,243
I think that I'm very interested in the 
relationship between comedy and power 

524
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:08,234
and I'm very interested as someone who's
been ridiculed for entering the public 

525
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:13,970
political sphere out of a comedic 
background.

526
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,090
How actually in reality the people in 
power often used comedy and humor to get

527
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:24,040
what they want and to create the kind of
impressions that they want.

528
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,320
Should we have a listen to Nigel farrage
being funny now because he's,

529
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,820
he's another politician that sort of,
I think,

530
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,713
you know,
like you can't sort of whether or not 

531
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:32,564
you agree with people's politics,
is there the power of their tree and 

532
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:38,180
that their ability to have an impact.
Is that something that sort of,

533
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,063
you know,
even in humor is something that we have 

534
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:42,800
to take seriously and then we've got the
prime minister

535
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,630
or should I call him in this context?
Piggy in the middle.

536
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,540
Oh,
that's a good joke.

537
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,360
Now obviously that's a joke that he's 
doing that when David Cameron,

538
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,253
as we know that the former prime 
minister put his genitals into a pig's 

539
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:05,154
mouth.
That's just the prime minister of a 

540
00:25:06,031 --> 00:25:08,850
country putting his genitals in the 
mouth of a dead pig there.

541
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,901
Um,
so like,

542
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:11,340
um,
like,

543
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:12,270
ah,
for Raj,

544
00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:15,840
I think he's an interesting case because
one of the things that humans being used

545
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:18,000
for in all of these cases is,
I'm like,

546
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:20,010
you,
we're like one another.

547
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:24,450
I'm not on the other side of some chasm 
of puppeteering you and using power.

548
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,493
Yeah.
There's a,

549
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,333
there's a sort of,
some element of sharing their people 

550
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:29,634
won't.
If people don't agree with you or don't 

551
00:25:31,411 --> 00:25:32,700
like you,
they won't laugh,

552
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,140
you know?
It's um,

553
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,420
yeah,
I hate that that's happened to me before

554
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,100
and it's,
it's certainly,

555
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:39,300
uh,
you know,

556
00:25:39,301 --> 00:25:41,370
I can think of comedians obviously,
not you,

557
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:45,960
but I can think of comedians that I 
would never see something about them.

558
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,793
I don't like them and I'm,
I can't imagine what they'd have to do 

559
00:25:47,911 --> 00:25:49,620
to make me laugh.
Now that's just me making it place.

560
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,513
Literally,
literally nothing to do with them 

561
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,883
entirely to do with my biases,
but it will affect my behavior around 

562
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:56,370
them.
So I can appreciate,

563
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,391
you know,
with frauds,

564
00:25:57,391 --> 00:26:00,420
I can recognize the structure of that 
joke and how well it's gone down,

565
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:02,560
but I'm still not smiling because,
you know,

566
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,450
again,
like voices.

567
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,000
It's about who I want to be.
I don't want to be part of that human.

568
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:07,800
I don't want to be sharing that.
But you're right,

569
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,680
there's a strong element of sharing and 
agreement.

570
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,480
Yes.
That's how it's being used.

571
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:14,370
I mean,
because even the word communicator means

572
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:17,710
creator of community creating 
allegiances.

573
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,830
You're communicating.
We're not one.

574
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,723
We are many that are bonded and I see 
Alan Moore that are graphic artists 

575
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,010
saying that,
you know,

576
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:26,844
they use like spelling,
but we spell that there's a magic in 

577
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:29,910
words.

578
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,390
You can create feelings in another 
person through what you say.

579
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,010
I think that this is a powerful and 
appealing idea to me.

580
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,073
Um,
and at this time I suppose it's sort of 

581
00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:42,750
a pact.
Is it a postmodern phenomena?

582
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:45,930
I know I'm not qualified to say,
but we're sort of seeing an emergence of

583
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:50,670
a different type of politician and that 
its apex I think is Donald Trump.

584
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,533
And I'd like to talk about him and his 
use of humor and his ability to 

585
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:57,150
communicate because this is a thing that
is sort of difficult to say,

586
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:58,570
but I'll ask anyway.
So I'm,

587
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,150
I kind of like,
I mean,

588
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,100
he's personally attacked me,
like,

589
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:03,330
you know,
like literally I've got,

590
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,370
we use it in my standup show,
rebirth.

591
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,383
There's like huge.
Like there's a bit of him guard Russell 

592
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,053
Brand Byron Idiot.
I really like naming me and attacking 

593
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:12,990
me.
But before he was president actually.

594
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,823
But that's,
you know.

595
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,853
But um,
it's kind of what I like about Donald 

596
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,150
trump is a sentence that's not easy to 
finish,

597
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,560
is that he's kind of,
he's kind of certainty.

598
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:30,390
And like there's something I think quite
likable sort of shrugging.

599
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:31,224
He always seems like he's shrugging off 
and I find it sort of interesting when 

600
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:36,414
things are so,
so because I suppose my particular take 

601
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,970
on politics is that there's a lot of 
concealment,

602
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,480
a lack of transparency.
Someone like Donald Trump,

603
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:46,111
I sort of think,
well,

604
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:49,050
there's a plainness of bovine 
obviousness.

605
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:53,280
I'm rather enjoying that things are 
being revealed that shouldn't be.

606
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,173
And things are being concealed.
That shouldn't be like the top of his 

607
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:56,541
head.
There's,

608
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,350
have a,
let's have a listen to.

609
00:27:58,351 --> 00:27:59,184
Um,
I just have a listen to Donald Trump 

610
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,110
saying saying,
you've got it there.

611
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:02,170
Django Hillary

612
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:07,170
accidentally bumped into me and she very
civilly said,

613
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,340
pardon me,
this is the first time ever,

614
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,153
ever that Hillary is sitting down and 
speaking to major corporate leaders and 

615
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:26,834
not getting paid for it.
The media is even more bias this year 

616
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:32,580
than ever before.
However,

617
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:38,070
Michelle Obama gives a speech and 
everyone loves it.

618
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:43,520
It's fantastic.
They think she's absolutely great.

619
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,010
My wife,
Melania gives the exact same.

620
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,323
That's actually a good job.
That's the best joke because he's the 

621
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:57,140
victim of it.
That is so self effacing.

622
00:28:57,141 --> 00:28:57,710
I mean,
NASA.

623
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,630
Gosh,
that's dangerous.

624
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,493
Now this has been an argument like the 
second one was obviously in front of 

625
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:06,110
Hillary Clinton.
He criticized there again accurately.

626
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,040
And you can say,
of course,

627
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:07,640
like,
you know,

628
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,473
communicative skills become more 
important in a time when there's a lack 

629
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:11,920
of trust.
Uh,

630
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,793
talking about people generally speaking,
feel like the politics doesn't serve 

631
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:16,790
them,
that democracy doesn't serve them.

632
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,773
If someone turns up that's kind of 
applicable or appealing in a way that's 

633
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:22,300
surprising.
Hey,

634
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:25,230
so it has a particular impact.
What was there?

635
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,530
What did you think about that?
He's certainly has.

636
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,473
He has quite a strange voice because he 
doesn't do a lot of the things that 

637
00:29:31,821 --> 00:29:34,890
people kind of get pushed towards in a 
liquor.

638
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,773
Certainly for British and I know that 
has to be a provider that obviously I 

639
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,460
don't understand American accents in the
same way,

640
00:29:40,461 --> 00:29:42,460
but it doesn't sound communication.

641
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,733
It doesn't sound like he's given them 
any insight into perhaps don't do that 

642
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:48,940
strange high pitched thing when you're 
going for a job,

643
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:51,350
but you know he's because he's got a 
high pitched voice and he sounded,

644
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:52,030
you know,
it's not.

645
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,863
It's a bit nicer with there some 
restriction going on in there and it's 

646
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,950
kind of,
I can't do it,

647
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:58,330
but they're there.
It's got a quite a,

648
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,300
quite a limited range of 30.
He doesn't.

649
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,860
What does that mean?
The music of your voice and we go in and

650
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:06,694
out of fashion is unlocking that.
If you remember back to when Neil 

651
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,343
Kinnock did that amazing speech about 
militant and the grotesque chaos will 

652
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:15,790
leave.
It comes a little lever counseling.

653
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,280
It's just a beautiful piece of music.
It's just,

654
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:19,470
it's an amazing speech,
but the,

655
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,540
the,
the,

656
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,850
the music of his voice is absolutely 
extraordinary.

657
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,970
Is furious,
absolutely furious.

658
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:30,420
And that's gone largely out of fashion.
You don't find in u k political rhetoric

659
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:35,410
that that kind of use and the voice in 
that way because it sounds hysterical.

660
00:30:35,411 --> 00:30:39,070
I bet it doesn't sound managed or 
managerial bureaucratically.

661
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,543
Like one of the things that came in with
Tony Blair and actually Debbie Cameron 

662
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,530
fully did this as well,
was that kind of like,

663
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,423
well,
we're just having a chat sort of 

664
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,820
quality.
I'm talking to you now.

665
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,210
This is because you can trust me.
It is new labor.

666
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,343
Look,
I'm just actually just saying stuff 

667
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,001
like.
Yeah,

668
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:02,890
I know what you mean.
There was sort of,

669
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:06,450
it was my friend Adam Curtis says that 
it was like,

670
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,303
you know,
like sort of Clinton and Blair was 

671
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,440
heralding of a sort of a managerial type
of politics.

672
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:12,910
We're just managers.
What we are,

673
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:14,490
we like middle managers at work.
You don't.

674
00:31:14,491 --> 00:31:16,020
We're not sort of powerful demagogues.

675
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,810
We're not sort of people that are would 
like them.

676
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:18,683
It's not like an outfit that punching 
above his weight there from the podium 

677
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:22,114
fishing the skies and roaring like as 
people just meekly giving you data and 

678
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:30,880
quite an affable way now like Tony Blair
continues to grow ever more presidential

679
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:31,714
while damning his own party.
But at that point it was like there was 

680
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:37,090
a kind of an unaccessible ordinariness 
to him.

681
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,983
Exactly.
And and it was obviously it's conveyed 

682
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:39,964
in many ways,
but it was really big part of how he 

683
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:44,530
spoke.
I'm aware that there's that phrase isn't

684
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:45,820
there to,
to a man with a hammer,

685
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,540
everything looks like a nail and I bring
everything down to voices except there's

686
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,010
other stuff going on.
But in that,

687
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,690
in that context you can even sort of 
seeing Obama was returning,

688
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,563
it had elements of a more kind of a 
classical rhetoric in his style and the 

689
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:01,900
way he uses voice and your point to make
here.

690
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:02,883
I imagine that he was afforded a 
different kind of exoticism because the 

691
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:05,674
narrative that is present presidency was
African American and there's always an 

692
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:10,024
American politics.
The idea that that is an inclusion from 

693
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,083
outside of the mainstream.
Using that to inflate the idea that the 

694
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:20,260
popular mainstream is ethical look after
all,

695
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,213
we've got an African American president 
and I suppose as if he had a different 

696
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:25,684
type of vocal license.
I don't know about different kinds of 

697
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:29,260
political license because there are sort
of different constraints.

698
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:32,590
We're talking about a particular issue,
but it's interesting that you had more.

699
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:34,750
What was that word again?
Oh,

700
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,673
he's just got a bit rhetorical.
President used the music of his voice 

701
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:39,980
quite a lot,
but I suppose it was also

702
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,813
interesting.
I'm Deborah Cameron's done some work on 

703
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:46,450
this woman from Oxford University 
professor at Oxford University and she's

704
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,770
described.
Have you looked at.

705
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,513
Come on.
If you look at a gang culture and you 

706
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:56,690
get a very particular linguistic use for
them,

707
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:57,524
gangs,
people use that to mark their 

708
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,023
membership.
If you look at female members of gangs 

709
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:05,780
in the US,
they will very often be the most kind of

710
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,223
like classic users of the slang because 
there might be other stuff they can't 

711
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:12,314
get involved in,
but they can get the words right and 

712
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,733
it's marking your,
I deserve to be here because I'm doing 

713
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:18,404
this right.
And maybe if Obama had been less formal 

714
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:22,040
in his speech,
people would be more like,

715
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,780
oh,
well I'll just can't do this at all.

716
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
You know,
um,

717
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:25,634
you know,
it was marking I deserve to be here and 

718
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:30,440
I can damn well you into this was 
perhaps held to a higher standard.

719
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,450
But you're saying they're very,
my voice now.

720
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:34,790
It's killing me as you can hear what 
you're saying.

721
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,090
Like Donald Trump sounds a little bit 
strangulated and sort of,

722
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,460
I mean his voice.
In fact,

723
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:41,294
sap,
like he very much positioned himself as 

724
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,460
I'm going into.
I'm draining the swamp.

725
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,840
Every said I'm going to go there.
I'm going to mix stuff up.

726
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:48,674
And he,
even on a vocal quality like the voice 

727
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:52,880
is interesting isn't because the voice 
in some ways is a ghost in the machine,

728
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,600
is the vibration of the vocal cords.
It isn't actually there at all.

729
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,670
Your Voice,
your inhabited by this thing.

730
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,160
So isn't there something essential about
voice?

731
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:02,510
This is part of your,
excuse me,

732
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,523
essence who you are or vocalist who you 
are at your core or your soul or 

733
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:07,634
something.
It is.

734
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,250
There's a real truthiness devices.
Um,

735
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,990
if I,
when I got here,

736
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:16,010
I was nervous and I was aware when I was
supposed picking to jen and when I first

737
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:16,844
met you,
I could hear the tension in my voice 

738
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,290
because it absolutely you can't get with
very hard to get past it.

739
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,243
It must be crippling to know that much 
about vocal communication and then to 

740
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,390
still be subject to rules that are 
beyond that kind of regulation.

741
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:31,070
And I'll know what the hell is this 
adrenaline doing?

742
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:32,510
Some of vocal folds.
But it's um,

743
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,940
and,
and that's just true.

744
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:35,774
So if you are in an emotional state,
it affects your body and your voice is 

745
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,140
being made by your body.
It sounds stupid,

746
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:42,974
but if I don't use my voice,
you won't know anything about what I 

747
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:46,340
sound like.
I have to do something.

748
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,040
It's an action as much as it is 
language,

749
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:49,960
the voice.
So it's uh,

750
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,610
it's,
you can get information from my facebook

751
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:54,110
photo.
If I was asleep,

752
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:54,944
I was dead.
My face doesn't need to do things for 

753
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,070
you to take a picture of you when you're
dead.

754
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,933
This has gone very much.
I'll be in touch with the coroner was 

755
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,990
really silent witness,
but you,

756
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,441
you,
you,

757
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,430
you have to do something for a voice to 
be there.

758
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:11,264
And that's why it is.
You say it's this weird ephemeral thing 

759
00:35:14,331 --> 00:35:15,980
and it's very,
so much and it's so.

760
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,420
And it can be an incredibly strong tell 
to your emotional state and while it can

761
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:24,100
be very hard to work around so because 
it was what it can,

762
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,800
what it can do to your body.
It's revealing.

763
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,640
So the more sort of masking techniques 
and manipulative techniques that you can

764
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:32,474
get into it,
the better,

765
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,550
but I suppose the,
all of the,

766
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,890
in a way that is hard to hold up an 
absolute standard because

767
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,993
like in other areas,
Barack Bama is being judged in a 

768
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:43,160
different way to Donald Trump.
Nigel farrage,

769
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:44,610
he's being charged in a different way.
It's,

770
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,350
it's reasonable to make Theresa May,
I think,

771
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,810
a bloody horrible voice.
Three to my haven't being funny,

772
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:52,690
but there's no sort of gargly,
Strangley,

773
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,860
post-coital sort of warble oh,
there's something in there.

774
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,220
I don't like much.
What is it?

775
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,640
I think um,
it's very immediate.

776
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,573
It's very hard to judge voices outside 
of everything else you know about 

777
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:07,180
somebody so that,
that's,

778
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,330
that's a difficult part.
What you're saying isn't evil voice.

779
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,810
He's got that kind of cracked bell 
quality.

780
00:36:12,811 --> 00:36:13,644
Like there's a.
I feel like she's striving to do 

781
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:19,030
something with a voice that she's not 
quite landing on and that's not.

782
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,030
But she's having them lessons.
You know,

783
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:22,660
when people get really famous that they 
go,

784
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,300
you're going to stop talking about that 
mate,

785
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,590
your prime minister now.

786
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,783
It's really interesting.
I'm listening to Margaret Thatcher now 

787
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:37,800
because she was told,
expressly told you,

788
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:40,110
speak to women,
speak with pitch to two eyes,

789
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,270
speak lower men with men won't take you 
seriously,

790
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,700
and when you listen to an hour,
all you can hear is the effort.

791
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,270
She's taking a voice down to somewhere 
where she probably didn't really want to

792
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:49,800
be.
And that's the majority of the argument.

793
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:54,210
You hear the falseness for like that 
sort of.

794
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,270
I'm down here,
I can't even catch the lowdown as the,

795
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,520
she again,
she,

796
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,050
I didn't remember that.
So these things.

797
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,153
So the very fact that so much effort 
expended on it means that it is a real 

798
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:08,460
thing.
It's a huge factor.

799
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,900
I can think of,
um,

800
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,423
you know,
significant politicians in the past few 

801
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:13,823
years who've been largely undone by 
aspects that people have heard in their 

802
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:18,190
voice and that they haven't been able to
work around.

803
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,543
Well,
ed miliband would be an example of 

804
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,690
somebody that seems like it sounds a 
bit.

805
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,190
What was it,
Buddy Hill?

806
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,093
Oh,
they'll go.

807
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,170
Both.
Just filled it out.

808
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:33,171
My buttons quite nasal quality to his 
voice and quite um,

809
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,340
it,
it,

810
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,520
it sounded like it was difficult for him
to speak.

811
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:45,360
No.
Normally he sounded scared of his voice.

812
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,910
That's think something that was said to 
be sounding voice.

813
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:49,140
So I've worked with someone.

814
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,680
Listen,
he sounded like someone who kind of knew

815
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:58,040
that people were going to be critical of
his voice when he started talking.

816
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,070
I Sat,
it does not,

817
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:05,100
it's not an election for not giving me a
bit of fun.

818
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,443
Well,
I am.

819
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,433
I've worked with a performance poet who 
actually has a very similar voice to ed 

820
00:38:11,111 --> 00:38:12,900
miliband and he does poetry out,
you know,

821
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:14,850
he's out on the streets doing poetry and
never,

822
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,743
never because it was a bit nasally.
I don't think people are enjoying this 

823
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,083
because he's just,
I'm doing my thing and I really wished 

824
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:20,394
they'd bill banker just love his voice 
and forget about what people might say 

825
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:25,800
about it because actually it was him,
sandy anxious about his voice.

826
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:27,960
His seat was often the thing you were 
picking up on,

827
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,180
like how you lose losing erection if you
think about it too much.

828
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:31,290
Sorry.
I said that now,

829
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:36,010
like now could we have listened to 
theresa and then

830
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,173
Jeremy Corbyn's see if we can judge 
their voices here that are in 

831
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:40,174
parliament.
We are going to hear Theresa May's 

832
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:42,034
Voice,
which Sophie Scott was already said she 

833
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,093
disliked.

834
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,943
What?
Did she support the reopening of 

835
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:47,584
Wellingborough prison some program or 
would you rather just sing happy 

836
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:58,231
birthday and I'm very happy to wish him 
a very copy the estate today.

837
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:01,924
Many happy returns.
I hope that Mrs Bowen is going to treat 

838
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:08,510
the occasion inappropriate manner in the
sex club,

839
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,160
a sex

840
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,160
quip.
So for Scott there is some.

841
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:20,400
I mean it feels unfair to which those 
people's voices,

842
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:23,760
because we've kind of got what we've got
and we're criticizing someone's foot,

843
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,683
but it's that there is a source of like 
a foot mouth won't shoes that were too 

844
00:39:30,391 --> 00:39:31,224
tight.
I can't tell you exactly what's 

845
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:33,804
happening,
but there's something going on that a 

846
00:39:35,011 --> 00:39:35,844
couple of points in the evening that 
joke where she lucky tent sound in a 

847
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,950
vocal folds is giving a weird sort of 
all.

848
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,113
It's a lot.
I can't do an impersonation of it and 

849
00:39:43,351 --> 00:39:45,900
Widdecombe does it a lot.
It's got a posh word speaking.

850
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,560
You think that.
Alright,

851
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,433
so we've caught all of this stuff.
There's obviously a neurological 

852
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:51,330
component until after we have discussed 
this,

853
00:39:51,331 --> 00:39:54,550
but there's an anatomical component of 
course to voice it says something that's

854
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,403
happening at the level of the vocal 
chords and you think that sometimes 

855
00:39:56,921 --> 00:40:01,320
there's a little strangulated how you 
hold at.

856
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,050
Well,
you know,

857
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,883
bearing in mind everything about your 
voice is reflecting a lot of complex 

858
00:40:04,591 --> 00:40:05,900
stuff about you,
but actually it's diff.

859
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,520
Big differences do come in and how you 
use your,

860
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,140
your larynx,
your vocal folds.

861
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,280
So,
um,

862
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,070
that's coming in in terms of just what 
have you got.

863
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:17,280
So men have larger vocal folds that are 
thicker,

864
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,140
so just like a larger musical 
instrument,

865
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:24,141
they make a lower sound.
And I'm the French horn.

866
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,120
The producer of this show plays French 
horn.

867
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:30,780
So I just gave me a little look then 
because I knew we'd be thinking about.

868
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,550
But even then if you,
um,

869
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,830
if you hold your vocal fold slightly 
differently.

870
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:38,664
So I,
I'm right now doing something called 

871
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:41,160
modal voice and they just,
you know,

872
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,710
that's how,
that's how I know using tricks,

873
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,540
how I am vibrating,
the vocal folds.

874
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:47,880
So all you do to vibrate them as you 
bring them together and then you're,

875
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,763
you're,
you're using your chest actually to 

876
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,980
produce a very finally controlled flow 
of air out.

877
00:40:52,981 --> 00:40:54,420
So they fly back and forth and make it 
sound.

878
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,463
Just like Gareth playing.
He's French horn when he's doing the 

879
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:58,290
same thing at his lips.

880
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,770
That's where you really can play.
So you've got this,

881
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,633
you've got this musical sound here,
but in fact even if you hold them under 

882
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:10,500
slightly different tension and I'm not,
now I'm doing something cool,

883
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:15,501
creaky voice voice and it's,
it's actually holding the vocal folds in

884
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,983
a slightly slack away.
So they vibrate differently and you get 

885
00:41:19,441 --> 00:41:21,410
this,
you get some soda,

886
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,640
sounds a bit more laid back to us 
actually.

887
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:24,474
Although they porsche wave speaking 
David Cameron and incredibly creaky 

888
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,030
voice.
That's that.

889
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,950
And it's a massive part of American 
accents.

890
00:41:30,951 --> 00:41:31,784
So it's actually one of the main one,
the main place where you'll find creaky 

891
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:34,484
voice

892
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,220
of my voice.
Right here I am.

893
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:38,090
This is me just talking.
Now.

894
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:40,400
I'm trying not to be self conscious.
I'm trying to be a normal man.

895
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,260
I have got a little bit water caught on 
the Tom and Jerry Punch.

896
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,400
Whatever.
You just get that.

897
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,120
If you know Tom and Jerry Punch bag 
proper.

898
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,653
According the Tom and Jerry a punch bag,
you have a very interesting voice 

899
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:53,930
because you really do use melody a great
deal and you're obviously you don't.

900
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,220
I'm new here.
Comes in,

901
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,910
comes the scientist to tell you that you
also speak quite quickly,

902
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,930
actually combines to give quite a 
pleasant way.

903
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,513
Christ on Mount Sinai.
It would've been good at talking one 

904
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:08,731
day.
Jesus.

905
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:10,520
He must have been hearing from us well 
into it.

906
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,020
Let's face it,
it caught on.

907
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,463
There's actually something really 
central about humans standing up and 

908
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:19,310
talking and people or doing things with 
their voices.

909
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,143
People like watching it.
We like watching somebody speak with 

910
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:24,170
skill.
We like watching somebody saying,

911
00:42:24,171 --> 00:42:26,450
we love watching somebody big box.
We're like watching actors.

912
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:27,410
We,
we actually,

913
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:30,560
there's something really entrancing 
about the performance of the voice.

914
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,790
What'd you think about Hitler then?
Not as policies.

915
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,720
There's face it now we can say that he 
was a cruel man,

916
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,753
like he's vocal style.
Putting that to one side moment for 

917
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,143
crimes.
He seems to have been a very engaging 

918
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:44,084
public speaker.
There's a wonderful quentin crisp quote 

919
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,350
satellite.
Someone asked him,

920
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:51,050
why did Hitler have charisma and credit?
Crispin said,

921
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,340
well,
I suppose he must have done otherwise.

922
00:42:53,341 --> 00:42:54,174
You wouldn't have an awful lot of people
now have a certain age wandering around 

923
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:57,081
Germany saying,
well,

924
00:42:57,081 --> 00:43:01,520
I really don't know what came over me.
So he was obviously able to.

925
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:04,040
Yeah,
create the same man.

926
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:06,290
Quentin crisp offered this definition of
charisma.

927
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,160
The ability to influence without logic.
Yes.

928
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,880
An interesting definition of that.
So like,

929
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:12,763
because like when I watched hit lab,
we're trying to do for science against 

930
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:18,610
Hitler obviously,
but I think,

931
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,380
I don't know if I'd like someone going 
on like that at me.

932
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,710
He's really ranting and raving.
He seldom mellow.

933
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,193
Well I think it's,
suppose you just get these big fashions 

934
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:28,940
as well.
So we've seen it recently in politics,

935
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:30,920
big changes in what we think sounds like
appropriate.

936
00:43:30,921 --> 00:43:34,840
You just don't get Neil Kinnock style 
rhetoric in government now for us here,

937
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,710
we've moved very quickly through that 
and you,

938
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,070
you get these big changes and even see 
it in acting.

939
00:43:40,071 --> 00:43:41,510
If you go back,
you know,

940
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:45,740
over the last century styles and what 
looked like naturalistic acting change a

941
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:46,574
lot.
So what we want to see in a talker can 

942
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:51,530
be highly variable.
If you get that in and everything,

943
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:52,364
it's what humans do,
what we are cultures learn and develop 

944
00:43:54,771 --> 00:43:55,100
and change.

945
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,660
We don't tend to sit with just one thing
going,

946
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:57,703
this is the best it will ever be.
What are the external factors that are 

947
00:43:59,631 --> 00:44:00,464
changing?
Something as seemingly fundamental is 

948
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:02,880
natural,
but you know,

949
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,570
like this is what is natural with 
natural alters.

950
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:08,690
Because natural means essential.
Natural means without inflection.

951
00:44:08,691 --> 00:44:09,524
Natural means absolute and total.
And if that changes as a result of 

952
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:15,110
acculturation,
what is being expressed?

953
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,910
And one of the reasons I'm interested in
voice,

954
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:17,744
you know,
to share that shit with Juliet says in 

955
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,701
Romeo,
Juliet,

956
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:20,900
like voice,
voice,

957
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:21,734
be breath and breath be life.
But it's like it's something about 

958
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:24,764
essence.
And like in the beginning there was the 

959
00:44:25,821 --> 00:44:26,654
word or the vibration,
and I've heard these interesting sound 

960
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:32,550
from deep space.
It sounds like gongs vibrating

961
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,383
into the infinite,
that there is something like in the way 

962
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:39,810
that we communicate that is connected to
truth very,

963
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:40,644
very deeply.
And if this is something that can be 

964
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:42,953
manipulated and managed and used,
his power could potentially be 

965
00:44:46,261 --> 00:44:47,400
limitless.
Well,

966
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:48,234
it can be.
And you can certainly think of examples 

967
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:52,960
where we get caught up in this element 
of performance.

968
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,080
I suppose one thing is true,
it's all a performance.

969
00:44:55,081 --> 00:44:57,620
Me Talking to you now,
I am performing being so fee.

970
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,430
There's never a,
some abstract notion of uh,

971
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,580
sophie voice.
There's always been doing it for someone

972
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:03,414
somewhere in some particular context.
I'm never speaking without reference to 

973
00:45:05,641 --> 00:45:06,474
that.
And then there's the performance where 

974
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:08,904
we as a group of people decide to shut 
up and let some people worse than 

975
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,023
onstage,
do something with their voices were we 

976
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:18,600
then engage with that and what's 
expressed in that changes.

977
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,433
So we know over a lifetime all of us 
treat talk differently as we get older 

978
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:27,090
because the people around us change how 
they speak and we pick up on that.

979
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:31,110
Even the queen speaks differently to how
she used to speak her vows.

980
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,270
Shay,
now your majesty,

981
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,270
She's changed.
She's chopped it up a bit shallow and it

982
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:37,104
sounds,
it sounds like a continuous process of 

983
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:42,780
everybody coming a bit less posh.
That's back to old dvds.

984
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,570
I even don't have to go back very far 
like TB programs in the nineties.

985
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:46,404
You watched the news that everyone 
sounds incredibly posh and they will 

986
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:53,601
have sounded much less people in the 
fucking sit down and tolerate this path.

987
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:57,600
Well,
I'll tell you what that is.

988
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:00,020
I do think whether I won't tell you 
because you're an expert,

989
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,220
I'm just some bloke who's it for about 
it for half an hour,

990
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,520
but what I reckon it is is that because 
of mass communication,

991
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:09,000
we're all aware of broader context and 
different variables and are able to make

992
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:12,120
different comparisons and now there's 
sort of an emerging narrative that power

993
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:15,330
is corrupt and power is connected to,
I don't know,

994
00:46:15,331 --> 00:46:17,190
poshness and elitist.

995
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,220
So there's a lot of myself,
my accent changes.

996
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,143
I'm terrible.
May Have bounced up and down that class 

997
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,850
ladder like little trees,
football,

998
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,073
la.
Like when I'm the sort of around like 

999
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:28,900
sort of like my girlfriend really 
tormented me for a.

1000
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,170
she's that how much I love working class
men.

1001
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:35,070
Like when we went to think it was called
Drusen to pick up some gravel.

1002
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,050
I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry that that's my life.

1003
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:40,180
And there's this bloke there called mark
and he came over and wanted to fight ots

1004
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,373
that and I was like a lot and I said 
goodbye to him in an overly elaborate 

1005
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:48,320
way and even waved at him a second time.
I went back for another bite of a cherry

1006
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,600
out the window,
but no,

1007
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,630
actually I think I like that so I might 
turn off,

1008
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,290
but you don't need sand so that I might.

1009
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,080
I taught our power how much sodium or 
for power?

1010
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:05,040
The tomatoes are bloody cockney 
absolutely ridiculous.

1011
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:08,850
What's going on with it.
That's exactly why we change our voices.

1012
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:11,960
Interestingly,
the more we.

1013
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:13,143
Let's again,
we have to change our voices to talk to 

1014
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:18,780
somebody so soon as we started talking 
to each other without agreeing to do so,

1015
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:19,823
we started to breathe together because 
you have to do that to have a 

1016
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:22,344
conversation.
You have to coordinate how you breed 

1017
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,400
because that lets you time voices going 
back and forth,

1018
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:28,620
the turn taking conversation,
so physical.

1019
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,260
It really is,
and we also matched

1020
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,093
the pro,
the pitch and positive voices and the 

1021
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:33,934
rhythm of our voices.
We still have to bring together because 

1022
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:37,270
you've got this very rhythmic.
He's like,

1023
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:38,263
he's like a dance conversation and you 
can only do that dance if you start to 

1024
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:44,650
align your behavior so that has to 
happen to talk,

1025
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,693
and then the more you like someone,
the more you will start to do other 

1026
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:50,710
things,
to change your voice,

1027
00:47:50,711 --> 00:47:51,544
to bring it towards them.
So there are studies that have shown 

1028
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,573
that the more a man likes a woman will,
he will raise the pitch of his voice to 

1029
00:47:57,971 --> 00:48:01,060
be near to hers just now.
Like everybody's super self conscious,

1030
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,143
right,

1031
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,760
and you believe that you'll start to use
the same words.

1032
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:10,594
You start to use the same pronunciation,
jeep and start to use the same grammar 

1033
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:16,330
as each other and the and the more you 
like the communication here.

1034
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,193
That's the whole point of it is that 
we're trying to make a connection with 

1035
00:48:19,211 --> 00:48:21,700
one another.
We're trying to defy the material prison

1036
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:22,743
of our anatomy.
You're feeling trapped and it's the 

1037
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,234
voice,
this thing that he's not really holy or 

1038
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:28,534
truly you,
but a vibration emanating from you that 

1039
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:31,204
is your misery that you've sent out in 
the world to make connections and 

1040
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,430
communication with God.
I'm making this shit up,

1041
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,690
God,
but it,

1042
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,713
and it's always there,
so it's always expressing like a lot of 

1043
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:45,190
you that you don't realize and it's also
expressing how you feel about the people

1044
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:47,200
that you're talking to fairly 
unavoidably.

1045
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:47,680
Oh No.

1046
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,513
I'm going to start watching myself back 
on the because we do a bit of funny bit 

1047
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,450
in my standup show,
right where I talk about when I did this

1048
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:55,690
interview with Jeremy Paxman and one of 
the things that we make jokes about,

1049
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,233
I'm going by we.
I mean me because clearly I consider 

1050
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:01,474
myself for about nine people might 
actually have people that work with her 

1051
00:49:03,371 --> 00:49:04,600
in the room.
I'm like,

1052
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,153
is that I love about how I go through 
these different personas when dealing 

1053
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:12,700
with Jeremy Paxman,
they start very light and affable.

1054
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:15,970
Then there's a moment where I got really
serious and then I get very sort of.

1055
00:49:15,971 --> 00:49:19,030
I like I started deliberately or not 
deliberately,

1056
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:23,290
but unconsciously referencing ethnic 
speak rhythms,

1057
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:24,723
very working class base because I 
obviously see myself as speaking on 

1058
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:32,830
behalf of outsiders and I use it as an 
attack technique.

1059
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,290
It's very interesting to watch and your 
marketing,

1060
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:37,990
um,
because we can mark similarity with it.

1061
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,760
You can mark difference because I get 
right because I'm definitely not trying.

1062
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:45,430
I didn't go good.
I knew I'd have to say.

1063
00:49:45,431 --> 00:49:46,031
I'm like,
no.

1064
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:51,031
Listen brother.
I think it's absolutely ridiculous.

1065
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:56,060
It's like a grime single,
but it's still playing that your apps,

1066
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:56,923
your.
I was marking out your position to him 

1067
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:00,100
as clearly and how you're doing that.
What you're saying.

1068
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:02,460
I'm not like,
you're not actively want to be you,

1069
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:03,650
God.
I'm just telling myself.

1070
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:04,953
Right.
So that's because I suppose the reason 

1071
00:50:07,691 --> 00:50:08,930
that we wanted to talk to you,
Sophie Scott,

1072
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,750
is for us to understand how.
Excuse me,

1073
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:12,970
we can use these means of communication,
comedy,

1074
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,310
laughter,
and vocal style,

1075
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:16,690
but a,
Oh yeah,

1076
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:17,524
this is good.
This is a better question than minuses 

1077
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,090
gas because like,
yeah,

1078
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,073
this is,
it's more succinct way of saying what 

1079
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,084
vocal techniques should be aware of,
should we be aware of in the lead up to 

1080
00:50:24,941 --> 00:50:27,980
the election from Theresa May,
Corbin and other

1081
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,720
political leaders.
What should we watch out for?

1082
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:30,663
There's very strong outbreak.
If people just going back to the same 

1083
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:37,160
phrase,
strong and stable,

1084
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,300
rigging the election and just keep 
saying and even with the same breath,

1085
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:43,670
it's like they're just cutting and 
pasting into the stream of speeches.

1086
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,320
Why is this happening?
What's this?

1087
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:46,183
There was the assumption,
I've got no attention span and we're 

1088
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:49,370
bloody idiot.
What's going on?

1089
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,260
There is a fear.
It is.

1090
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:52,094
I think there's very good evidence that 
humans are not good at remembering 

1091
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,073
detail.
I remember just just remembering the 

1092
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:01,910
just you bloody idiot.
They think that's it.

1093
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:02,744
I think they're trying to influence the 
just and that just you let that just be 

1094
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:08,714
what it is.
When we met with surely creditors with 

1095
00:51:11,361 --> 00:51:12,194
the ability to understand at least some 
different words that mean strong and 

1096
00:51:14,331 --> 00:51:15,200
stable,
you know,

1097
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:20,201
rather than just repeat just exactly the
right and foreign and color,

1098
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:23,180
but no just bombard people in to do if 
people are beleaguered,

1099
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:24,680
fearful and last the whole time.

1100
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,150
If you just keep staying strong and 
stable,

1101
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:26,984
strong and stable,
who you're gonna vote for him starting 

1102
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,173
to roll out of order and if there's one 
of the odd things about people using 

1103
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:37,460
lightheartedness or comedy in their 
voice or in their approach,

1104
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,830
particularly in politics,
it can play hard.

1105
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,220
Well and it can also go horribly wrong,
you know,

1106
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,940
but there is a exactly like you said,
right at the top,

1107
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,103
there are situations where it's simply 
inappropriate and people will sort of 

1108
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,090
recoil from it like that.
That wasn't right then there,

1109
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:51,283
but in other situations it can be an 
incredibly efficient way of looking 

1110
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,270
confident and able and like,
do you know what?

1111
00:51:56,271 --> 00:51:57,140
I can do this.
Yeah,

1112
00:51:57,141 --> 00:51:59,810
because what you're saying is I'm not 
defined by this context,

1113
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:03,140
but that is a risky game to say that I'm
outside of this context.

1114
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:05,120
It's about power obviously,
isn't it?

1115
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:05,953
Because if people say it's not 
appropriate for you to say that in this 

1116
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:09,524
context by saying I'm in charge of the 
context and if you say I disagree with 

1117
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:13,964
you,
then you're saying I'm in charge of the 

1118
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:17,700
context is a real game.
It is,

1119
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:18,534
and I think sometimes one of the things 
that we like about people who would be 

1120
00:52:21,831 --> 00:52:22,664
prepared to use not necessarily like you
very rarely see somebody in politics or 

1121
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,100
just like all party all the time,
it just doesn't work,

1122
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:31,310
but drops would drop into is 
occasionally when it feels like,

1123
00:52:31,311 --> 00:52:34,420
or it could have gone a different way.
Now they've just sort of thrown a um,

1124
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,130
something slightly lighter hearted 
there.

1125
00:52:37,131 --> 00:52:38,880
That's kind of,
it's not just that,

1126
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:39,723
oh well I'm in here for giggles,
but I'm kind of confident enough to let 

1127
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:45,200
you know that this is easy.
This is nothing to worry about.

1128
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,033
I can do this.
And of course that might still be a bad 

1129
00:52:47,271 --> 00:52:48,104
thing.
I'm not saying it's a signifier of 

1130
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:49,723
someone's good,
but it's certainly one of the things 

1131
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:53,174
that is sorely lacking.
I think at the moment people quite seem 

1132
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:57,860
quite frightened of what they're saying 
and have going off message.

1133
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,430
I think a climate of fear is what Jay is
prohibitive and restrictive.

1134
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:02,264
I bet.
Fear literally affects us anatomically 

1135
00:53:04,221 --> 00:53:06,750
and constricts the vocal cords and 
socially it does that.

1136
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,660
People are less likely,
you know,

1137
00:53:08,661 --> 00:53:13,661
like when when I do live shows now and 
as I go out of metropolitan areas,

1138
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,740
I think there's a nervousness when I 
talk about Islam,

1139
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,633
when I talk about like sort of subjects 
that we've been taught to understand as 

1140
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:26,190
contentious and we therefore shouldn't 
laugh from

1141
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,070
them because I don't know what I'd be 
looking like that agreeing with that,

1142
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,720
where we go laugh though,
isn't it?

1143
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:31,554
That's the,
that's where the communication becomes 

1144
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:35,760
valuable,
but what we include in what's humorous.

1145
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,753
Now of course we won't be derisory 
dismissive or cruel about things that 

1146
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:43,110
are important,
but I think humor precisely builds these

1147
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:46,830
bonds as it does between a father and a 
baby.

1148
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:47,664
It does between whole communities 
recognizing that ultimately with the 

1149
00:53:49,651 --> 00:53:50,484
same.
I mean I've,

1150
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,793
I might posit dear Professor Sophie,
that's what comedy is continually doing 

1151
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,860
is it's sort of,
it's shifting the frame and we say like,

1152
00:54:00,861 --> 00:54:01,531
Oh,
here we are.

1153
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:02,364
You and I are having this conversation 
making these podcasts and then comedy 

1154
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:06,950
says,
but we're going to die me.

1155
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:07,890
See,
he's very,

1156
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:08,723
very,
very temporary arrangement between us 

1157
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,363
and if we don't acknowledge the truth of
the fact that we can't hold this 

1158
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:14,484
together,
that there are powerful elements of not 

1159
00:54:16,681 --> 00:54:17,514
only chaos of entropy and function that 
are going to mean that everything's 

1160
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:22,260
going to end.

1161
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,093
Things fall apart.
The center cannot hold and like I think 

1162
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:27,630
comedy is an expression that I'm all 
right with that.

1163
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:30,660
I'm okay with it and I think that like,
I use this a lot,

1164
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:32,220
but like Tommy Cooper's act,
he said,

1165
00:54:32,221 --> 00:54:33,054
well,
the reason I think is beautiful is 

1166
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:35,760
because Tommy Cooper,
British comedian,

1167
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,150
30 $40,
my God perhaps 50 years ago.

1168
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:43,050
And like a lifestyle of that did a photo
magic act where things went wrong.

1169
00:54:43,051 --> 00:54:44,610
And I think the reason it's so 
ingenious,

1170
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:45,444
it's because it's like his intention is 
like he's not even come on the stage to 

1171
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:48,684
try and be funny.
He's come out to try and do this magic 

1172
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:50,994
act and everything will be okay if only 
this magic cat goes all right and the 

1173
00:54:53,461 --> 00:54:54,294
magic act never does.
And that's where the intersection of 

1174
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:57,294
comedy happens there.
And if you look at sort of like musical 

1175
00:54:59,131 --> 00:55:01,110
entertainers like Frankie Howard or 
Kenneth Williams,

1176
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:04,100
they always glancing to the side,
there's Harry,

1177
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:04,973
he'll actually uses that sort of second 
camera that he talks into sound that 

1178
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:10,170
there's another layer to reality,
that there's a connection.

1179
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,460
I think between comedy and the trickster
and the trickster is forever saying this

1180
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:15,630
isn't the absolute contexts.
There is another world.

1181
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:17,100
There's another world.
And in the words of Morrissey,

1182
00:55:17,101 --> 00:55:18,270
there must be,
there must be,

1183
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:19,160
you know,
like.

1184
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,510
So that's what I think is important 
about comedy.

1185
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:25,550
Do you now think I'm clever?
I'm like,

1186
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,930
you're doing an man so as you must be,
but it's um,

1187
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,170
the clearly extremely well put point.
Pay Them.

1188
00:55:32,171 --> 00:55:33,260
I,
we pay them to go.

1189
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:34,863
It is very interesting.
If you look at the history of human 

1190
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:38,933
language,
and of course we were reliant on people 

1191
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,180
writing stuff down because words don't 
stay around.

1192
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:43,200
If you state them,
they've,

1193
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:46,020
you look at wherever you find people 
writing in human history,

1194
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:46,943
you find them writing down jokes.
People have been making jokes as far 

1195
00:55:50,491 --> 00:55:53,200
back as we can find written words.
They'd been writing graffiti on walls.

1196
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:54,623
There's a piece of Babylonian Papaya us 
with a really weak joke about how to 

1197
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,790
make a fair.
I go fishing.

1198
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:00,973
Um,
you put naked women in fishing nets and 

1199
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:07,890
maybe it works better in India,
in ancient Egypt.

1200
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:10,440
Maybe there's a pun in there.
In ancient Egyptian,

1201
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:14,170
they think,
well there's on its own is not enough.

1202
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:19,250
Put Women in fishing nets.
Drill fire could come into the pyramid.

1203
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,620
No,
you probably can't get out of here.

1204
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,380
There's a whole

1205
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:28,120
Roman book called the laughter lover,
which is,

1206
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,053
it's preserved all the jokes and it is 
interesting because they have the 

1207
00:56:31,691 --> 00:56:33,150
structure and appearance.
The jokes,

1208
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,043
they're not funny.
Jim Bowman actually did an act where he 

1209
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:38,620
read out from it and he had to do a lot 
of work,

1210
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:43,740
a lot of work and it's because of course
the,

1211
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,990
the,
the content changes.

1212
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:50,470
And I think a lot of the times science 
when it tries to look at comedy,

1213
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:51,783
gets caught up on that because you can't
find something that's always funny for 

1214
00:56:54,071 --> 00:56:55,780
everybody everywhere.
That one glance at that.

1215
00:56:55,781 --> 00:56:57,760
But by the Babylonian joke that somebody
that was so good,

1216
00:56:57,761 --> 00:56:59,500
they wrote it down,
um,

1217
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:02,260
suggest that,
but you don't want to forget this thing.

1218
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,390
Go and get mashups of paper.
It's probably a complicated.

1219
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:08,643
And then so you've got this.
But the point is that people were doing 

1220
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:11,710
it.

1221
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:14,980
We have used humor probably from as soon
as we had words,

1222
00:57:14,981 --> 00:57:15,814
we were laughing before we had words and
we will probably using words to try and 

1223
00:57:19,751 --> 00:57:22,690
get to laughed and maybe in a playful 
way or whatever way since then.

1224
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:23,823
But then you get this very interesting 
development as an art form because you 

1225
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:28,180
see this in humans,
you know,

1226
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:33,510
endlessly endlessly innovating and 
producing stuff that doesn't immediately

1227
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,870
kind of necessarily get you fed or keeps
you somewhere to sleep.

1228
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,120
But which is fun and interesting and 
engaging.

1229
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:42,850
When you see the modern humans may 
emerge.

1230
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:46,240
You just get this explosion of stuff and
comedy,

1231
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:47,074
I think a huge one of those things.
And you start to get the role of the 

1232
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:52,240
person that you say,
the trickster,

1233
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,433
the person who's the jester,
the person who has the role of kind of 

1234
00:57:56,231 --> 00:57:58,570
controlling that.
And it's a very,

1235
00:57:58,571 --> 00:57:59,980
very interesting evolution.

1236
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:04,180
It's worth bearing in mind that standup 
comedy is incredibly new art form.

1237
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:08,680
The only really existed as we would 
recognize it with,

1238
00:58:08,681 --> 00:58:09,514
you know,
some one person on stage talking to the 

1239
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:15,460
audience since a really unfortunate man 
called Frank Fay.

1240
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:16,323
He was around,
he was around sort of in the twenties 

1241
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:18,544
and thirties,
but he was the first guy who had the 

1242
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:25,270
sort of hotspur to not have another 
person on stage with him.

1243
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:26,783
Exactly.
So it was to never feed and he didn't 

1244
00:58:28,391 --> 00:58:29,224
have comedy costumes and he didn't.
He kind of came on stage not going blog 

1245
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:38,140
and I'm not putting anything on.
And they had this kind of like,

1246
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,250
it's easy to find some flexible youtube 
because it's very.

1247
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:44,710
It doesn't look like I'm not the 
strongest material,

1248
00:58:44,711 --> 00:58:48,400
but it absolutely slayed.
And he had this kind of confidence to do

1249
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:50,350
this and it was.
That was part of you consider themselves

1250
00:58:50,351 --> 00:58:51,184
to be a lot better than the other 
comedians must have done because they 

1251
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:55,110
just have the balls to go up.

1252
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,213
They June no more light to the feed guy.
Phil incarcerate must've been 

1253
00:58:59,231 --> 00:59:00,390
magnificent.
We're lucky charms,

1254
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,293
comedy politics.
Well actually also choose politics and 

1255
00:59:04,351 --> 00:59:07,050
the reason why it's not.
Oh Frankie,

1256
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:07,943
he's not more frequently discussed the.
He was a massive Nazi maps upside with 

1257
00:59:15,371 --> 00:59:16,950
Franklin,
so very good.

1258
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,430
This guy,
hold on a second.

1259
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:23,500
This slaughter all non Christian people 
killed the Gypsies about him,

1260
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,190
right?
Yeah.

1261
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:25,860
No,
frank.

1262
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,090
I'm not going to fly.
You're going to need to get advocates.

1263
00:59:28,091 --> 00:59:30,160
He used to work with.
I won't work with fitbit.

1264
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,450
They bought.
Why not have them all?

1265
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,200
Oh Frank.
Horrible Nazi.

1266
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:41,160
He was running pro Hitler rallies in New
York after police.

1267
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,880
Pretty much people who felt that was 
done and dusted.

1268
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,860
The this Hitler Fella.
Hey,

1269
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:53,861
bad tool band checked your fucking face.
So he's largely not remembered fondly.

1270
00:59:56,570 --> 01:00:00,980
Really.
I'll see frank better commemorate it.

1271
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:03,050
Bev,
you look at Bob Hope.

1272
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,153
You can see Bob Hope's act.
He was completely influenced by his 

1273
01:00:07,131 --> 01:00:10,570
voice and sort of the appearance and 
that kind of sophisticated gentlemen act

1274
01:00:10,571 --> 01:00:11,930
law.
What's the great master?

1275
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:12,913
So you can see the roots of it there.
So they think that that hat on you can 

1276
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:17,624
sort of see stand up comedy is being 
another manifestation in our culture of 

1277
01:00:21,141 --> 01:00:25,240
this endless drive for humor,
for comedy and we're still,

1278
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,530
I think negotiating the role of what 
that means.

1279
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,393
What's this discussion about like the 
written word versus or a tree because 

1280
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:35,810
like I've heard that like there's some 
people like this in America.

1281
01:00:35,811 --> 01:00:37,410
He calls himself American Indian 
actually,

1282
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,990
sadly deceased called Russell me.

1283
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:39,983
It's like that.
He says there's this beautiful speech 

1284
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:43,760
which I read written down,
but it begins.

1285
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:44,990
Lastly you,
yeah,

1286
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:45,824
you may very well be reading this,
but I'm speaking [inaudible] European 

1287
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:49,280
people.
One of the things you've given us is the

1288
01:00:49,281 --> 01:00:51,800
written word will.
Ours is an oral tradition and we believe

1289
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:52,634
in the truth of speech and the parents,
which they never had to have a thing 

1290
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:55,184
about socrates saying that it was sort 
of more important the spoken word and 

1291
01:00:58,581 --> 01:01:01,070
the written word because there isn't a 
central truth that can only.

1292
01:01:01,071 --> 01:01:03,590
I supposed to relate to the voice and 
the presence.

1293
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,730
What does this all mean?
Well,

1294
01:01:04,731 --> 01:01:06,770
I think that's exactly because there's 
the person there.

1295
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:07,663
You've got that you're reacting to more 
than just the words they're saying and 

1296
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:11,953
you can't not.
You're making assumptions about that 

1297
01:01:13,821 --> 01:01:16,160
person.
If you couldn't see me,

1298
01:01:16,161 --> 01:01:16,994
you would probably have an idea of what 
I looked like based on what I sound 

1299
01:01:19,281 --> 01:01:19,410
like.

1300
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:22,460
They could be utterly wrong,
but we do that all the time.

1301
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:24,920
We're always trying to work out who 
people are,

1302
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:25,820
where they're from,
all this.

1303
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:27,710
At the same time as they're talking to 
us,

1304
01:01:27,711 --> 01:01:31,550
we're adding in all this other stuff 
about who we think they must be based on

1305
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:32,384
what they sound like and it gives a 
power and an interpretation than 

1306
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:37,274
sometimes the truth to voices that I 
think does give it a different kind of 

1307
01:01:40,671 --> 01:01:41,504
waste and the written word is amazing,
but you can see and you look at people 

1308
01:01:44,691 --> 01:01:45,524
trying to write texts or emails or the 
way they try and put stuff back in to 

1309
01:01:49,101 --> 01:01:51,830
kind of try and give their character 
their the emojis or dancing.

1310
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:56,090
The emergence of emojis is because of 
the limitations of the spoken word.

1311
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:56,924
I mean,
you remember how it used to be like 

1312
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:58,783
there was too many problems around like 
miscommunication around text and email 

1313
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:05,310
and like it was forever happening.
We made.

1314
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,590
I was upsetting people unlike when I'm 
on radio,

1315
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:08,720
I steak right out.
I travel.

1316
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:09,650
No,
no,

1317
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:10,770
that was funny.
Come on.

1318
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,860
Do you know what I meant?
Smiley face.

1319
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:14,770
Apology face.
I'm like,

1320
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:16,310
but like sort of.
I can see that.

1321
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:17,144
Yes.
There's a level of sophistication that 

1322
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:20,070
the written word can't deliver

1323
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:23,150
and perhaps in the pans of proust and 
there are other you.

1324
01:02:23,151 --> 01:02:23,984
So the written word,
you can sit there and do some sorts of 

1325
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:28,020
compositional work on it before you 
deliver it to the world.

1326
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:28,854
You know,
when you start talking you've got to 

1327
01:02:29,641 --> 01:02:32,480
keep going.
I launched on a sentence and I'm somehow

1328
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:34,990
got the make my way to the end of it.
Frank fry weren't a racist.

1329
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,440
Oh it is this sky and bloody well and 
another thing that this threat chat chat

1330
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:44,490
now,
but he wasn't like that.

1331
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:48,030
He was more of a smarmy character.
It was fairly unpleasant.

1332
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:52,020
Can't be a Nazi.
Gone mostly say a cow.

1333
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:54,090
Oh yeah.
We had this thing,

1334
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:58,740
professors sophie,
that a aint helpin the satire satirizing

1335
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,650
trump,
that it makes him more cozy and likable,

1336
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:03,720
ineffable somehow,
and it's just not a monster vacation.

1337
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,080
It's sort of affable.
I think it is sometimes the case that we

1338
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:07,914
can mistake laughing at somebody for 
being like the end of the critical work 

1339
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:13,230
we need to do and it was associated with
them.

1340
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:15,580
So it is really interesting that,
uh,

1341
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,730
it was it John Oliver a couple of years 
ago was going,

1342
01:03:17,731 --> 01:03:19,410
oh,
please run for presidency is going to be

1343
01:03:19,411 --> 01:03:21,570
so funny.
And it was funny.

1344
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,690
There were some amazing and it was also 
actually happening.

1345
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:25,963
And then it's actually company.
It's funny now I'm still trying to keep 

1346
01:03:28,981 --> 01:03:31,740
it humorous flap just by looking at it 
as if it's not real,

1347
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,220
but it is real,
isn't it?

1348
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:34,203
Yeah.
This is actually happening as far as we 

1349
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:38,670
know,
it's actually there and that's now,

1350
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:40,830
you know,
you can make.

1351
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:41,873
It's interesting to see how people make 
very good at making jokes at the stuff 

1352
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,390
around I'm a trump,
you know,

1353
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:49,413
all that.
Sean Spicer stuff that they're doing so 

1354
01:03:50,851 --> 01:03:51,684
well on snl.
It's harder because it's already absurd 

1355
01:03:54,241 --> 01:03:54,840
and point,
you know,

1356
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,673
we were already made all the jokes they 
were to make about him before he became 

1357
01:03:57,991 --> 01:03:58,824
president and it seems that it's almost 
like a limit to how far we can go with 

1358
01:04:03,571 --> 01:04:03,630
it.

1359
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:04,600
If you look at,
you know,

1360
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:05,583
popular sites like the onion.
I'm not there making funny jokes but 

1361
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:08,694
actually not landing on trump because 
maybe that's already we're already too 

1362
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:13,674
far into it to be able to have any 
distance enough to make jokes about it 

1363
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,720
or maybe it's just that it doesn't 
matter.

1364
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:19,890
You know,
if you're making jokes,

1365
01:04:19,891 --> 01:04:21,780
you're still talking about him and he's 
still winning.

1366
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:23,003
Evidently there was a degree of 
sophistication to that campaign that 

1367
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:26,223
obviously this of popular press we're 
not aware of and I think it's sort of 

1368
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:34,290
like more as well as communicative.
It was statistical.

1369
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:38,070
I think they understood that these 
people in this area want this message.

1370
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:38,993
Give them that message no matter what 
the people over there think they're 

1371
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,010
never gonna vote for you anyway.
Forget them.

1372
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,233
I mean you can sort of see as well,
so communicate the relationship between 

1373
01:04:48,361 --> 01:04:51,870
communication and truth versus 
authenticity.

1374
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:52,441
Like,
you know,

1375
01:04:52,441 --> 01:04:53,274
like the white sort of politics has 
changed in that it seems to be this 

1376
01:04:55,861 --> 01:04:58,610
peculiar.
It's dance or manipulation of power now.

1377
01:04:58,820 --> 01:04:59,653
It's notable.
I think that there's a sort of now kind 

1378
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:05,550
of redundancy to Ukip.
You kind of think ukip done its job.

1379
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:10,080
The Conservative Party is you kip now,
so it doesn't really,

1380
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:15,350
you don't really require one for Raj has
so disappeared like an of a tenor to.

1381
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:17,123
It's interesting that I would use that 
kind of a vocal or word not just to 

1382
01:05:20,701 --> 01:05:21,534
impress you,
but also because it seems right that 

1383
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:23,203
there's,
there is this something tonally about 

1384
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:26,044
the conservative party that seems to be 
acknowledging exclusion that the anti 

1385
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:30,124
immigration rhetoric,
this vague xenophobia and of course the 

1386
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:38,740
removal from the European Union itself.
It's present,

1387
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,633
it's present now politically.
There's doesn't seem to be any need for 

1388
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:46,450
it now for Ukip.
I mean primarily I entirely agree.

1389
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:47,350
It's,
um,

1390
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:48,663
it's been an interesting cycle to watch 
it happen and there was something 

1391
01:05:51,941 --> 01:05:52,774
similar happened in the seventies,
but the really far right organizations 

1392
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:56,733
which were essentially expressly 
incorporated into Margaret Thatcher's 

1393
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,760
version of conservatism and we've seen 
an nf and stuff.

1394
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:05,203
Yeah,
the,

1395
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:07,500
the British National Party that can do,
you know,

1396
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:08,413
and they were pretty full on and there 
was kind of an extension of what the 

1397
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,950
Conservative Party roughtly colored as a
remit that just started,

1398
01:06:17,951 --> 01:06:20,080
just incorporate it.
And they did indeed go away,

1399
01:06:20,081 --> 01:06:20,914
is gangs of skinheads at rallies,
but they then became the government got 

1400
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:27,950
rid of those gangs of skin edge around.
It's almost like God,

1401
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,250
the government now still agreeing with 
it.

1402
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:31,143
Yeah,
yeah,

1403
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:32,860
yeah.
That's very interesting.

1404
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,690
Sophie.
Sixteen minutes.

1405
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:35,524
We've done.
This has already been longer than I 

1406
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:37,564
anticipated.
I really enjoyed the analysis of the 

1407
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:41,500
politicians.
I liked the role of laughter.

1408
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:43,630
Should we try and find something 
optimistic to end upon?

1409
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,553
I mean if laughter and Kim and 
communication and it's ultimately about 

1410
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:51,070
creating a community,
then perhaps they will always be.

1411
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:54,520
There has to be a role for or 
authenticity doesn't there.

1412
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:55,503
There has to be a way that we can 
communicate those central truths and it 

1413
01:06:57,551 --> 01:06:59,740
will bring people together.
They aren't or can't be.

1414
01:06:59,741 --> 01:07:01,450
This reductive,
repetitive,

1415
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:02,343
simplistic,
disingenuous politics that's come to 

1416
01:07:04,241 --> 01:07:06,070
govern our time.
This kind of casual,

1417
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:08,850
halfhearted,
almost nihilism of,

1418
01:07:08,851 --> 01:07:10,690
uh,
of the trump presidency,

1419
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:13,570
the madness of the lurch to the right 
across the world.

1420
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:16,060
Is there another way?
Is there another way?

1421
01:07:16,061 --> 01:07:16,730
I mean,
I.

1422
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:18,910
something that you've kept talking about
in your,

1423
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:21,490
that was really badly put.
Was it something you kept talking about?

1424
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:26,560
You keep coming back to love and I think
there's,

1425
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:31,490
I think we haven't been very good at 
recognizing the importance of law.

1426
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,330
You shouldn't be embarrassed about that.

1427
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,010
Why?
So That's interesting.

1428
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:38,620
There's been removed from the,
from the centric the bay.

1429
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,720
We've been told like don't talk about 
love is stupid.

1430
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:43,690
It's childish.
I mean this attack on Jeremy Corbyn,

1431
01:07:43,691 --> 01:07:47,410
Martin headed by Boris Johnson were 
saying stuff like that.

1432
01:07:47,411 --> 01:07:48,244
You know,
if you're at eaton saying things like 

1433
01:07:48,971 --> 01:07:49,804
that probably gets you to the top.
Probably get first dibs on the facts if 

1434
01:07:53,051 --> 01:07:54,640
you can come up with a little lyric like
that.

1435
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,780
But like saying that,
oh,

1436
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:58,150
he's too compassionate,
he's too kind.

1437
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:01,990
He wouldn't nuke people willy nilly.
It's not saying that there's no room for

1438
01:08:01,991 --> 01:08:05,770
love or compassion or connection like 
that.

1439
01:08:05,771 --> 01:08:07,750
These things are sort of,
they have no place in the,

1440
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,300
in power,
uh,

1441
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:12,610
but they,
they're central to our lives.

1442
01:08:12,611 --> 01:08:15,950
So here's an example that all the 
evidence

1443
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,873
now seems to suggest that losing your 
hearing in adulthood is a significant 

1444
01:08:21,801 --> 01:08:23,650
risk for dementia.
Whoa.

1445
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:26,320
Recap.
And it's a significant risk.

1446
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:27,283
Why?
Pay attention to how loud headphones on 

1447
01:08:28,631 --> 01:08:29,960
when you're listening to music.
But it's,

1448
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:33,350
um,
it's interesting because it doesn't seem

1449
01:08:33,351 --> 01:08:35,180
to be because it's happening to the same
mechanism.

1450
01:08:35,181 --> 01:08:37,760
It's not the same thing that's affecting
your ears as affecting your brain.

1451
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:38,773
It seems to be because losing your 
hearing and not necessarily getting 

1452
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:44,600
access to ways of restoring that takes 
you out of social interaction,

1453
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:48,560
disconnect and you go mad and you wear 
your brain does not work as well.

1454
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,760
Everything that we know about human 
brains say they evolve in interactions,

1455
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,830
they develop in interactions.
Everything.

1456
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:55,664
Your baby's learning about the world,
most of it she's learning and 

1457
01:08:57,351 --> 01:09:02,150
interactions with you.
She got no pressure,

1458
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:04,550
but that's the and it continues being 
the case.

1459
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:07,400
It's our main way of making,
maintaining social bonds,

1460
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:08,234
remained talking to each other,
even in a world where you could do it 

1461
01:09:10,011 --> 01:09:12,020
all we text,
we still go face to face,

1462
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:12,854
we still talk to each other and that is 
essential to our function as humans and 

1463
01:09:16,701 --> 01:09:18,980
I think we are getting less and less 
kind of,

1464
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:19,883
um,
well even the reason that we don't seem 

1465
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:23,020
to be able to get this message across 
the,

1466
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:23,893
you know,
that the hearing loss is really risky 

1467
01:09:25,191 --> 01:09:26,870
for you,
not just because it's a pain in the neck

1468
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:27,704
to lose your hearing,
but it could really manifestly affect 

1469
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:30,494
the shape of your life.
We're not even taking that seriously as 

1470
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:33,360
a problem.
It's like,

1471
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:34,193
yeah,
well that's one to watch out for them 

1472
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:37,000
and it's that.
It's the link,

1473
01:09:37,001 --> 01:09:37,834
the social link,
the human contact that that's actually 

1474
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:41,144
preventing that.
I think we start to need to acknowledge 

1475
01:09:42,651 --> 01:09:44,630
more,
and I'm going to obviously I'm saying so

1476
01:09:44,631 --> 01:09:45,464
from a scientific perspective because I 
think in science we tend not to take 

1477
01:09:48,081 --> 01:09:48,920
these things seriously.

1478
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:52,010
We study speech without ever considering
that we talk to each other,

1479
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:54,660
we study emotions and never look at 
laughter,

1480
01:09:54,661 --> 01:09:55,494
you know,
we just don't go in that direction very 

1481
01:09:57,141 --> 01:09:57,974
often,
but I think it might be a wider part of 

1482
01:09:58,851 --> 01:10:02,480
our debate about who we are as humans 
because you know,

1483
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:05,210
to be massively influenced by your 
interview with Adam Curtis,

1484
01:10:05,211 --> 01:10:06,044
that the rise of individualism I think 
sometimes takes the emphasis off what 

1485
01:10:09,921 --> 01:10:10,754
we're doing to each other and more onto 
us somehow powering through life on our 

1486
01:10:13,941 --> 01:10:17,000
own towards death and actually it's not 
trivial.

1487
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:21,020
That's the contact we have with other 
people is not a meaningless aspects.

1488
01:10:21,021 --> 01:10:23,270
That extra little bit of cheesecake in 
our life.

1489
01:10:23,271 --> 01:10:24,104
It's.
It's actually essential to being a 

1490
01:10:24,681 --> 01:10:26,090
human.
That's beautiful.

1491
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:28,200
What a lovely way to end.
Professor Sophie Scott.

1492
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:31,070
We must communicate.
We must connect.

1493
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,140
There's more to life than being an 
individual.

1494
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,090
As a beautiful message.
Thank you very much.

1495
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,940
Thank you for getting under the skin 
with me.

1496
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,930
Professor Sophie Scott.
Oh.
