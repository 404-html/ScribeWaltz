1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,510
I not think this individualistic culture
is in itself.

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:07,740
Destroying the principles are spiritual 
human level of community.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,723
Do you not think that economic 
inequality creates in a human being a 

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:13,470
sense of injustice,
of unfairness?

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,393
Because people.
Do you know what Kandis the 90 percent 

6
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,360
of people that are rich?
Do you know why they're rich?

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,700
They was born rich because I to tell you
something,

8
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:23,670
I think that economic disparity creates 
that feeling,

9
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:24,504
but at a fundamental understanding of 
economics can tell you that most people 

10
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:30,750
that are rich are born rich.
It's not like there's a tiny minority of

11
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:31,584
people that are like you that come from 
a poor background and managed to 

12
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:36,130
overcome it,
and this is what a pro I problem.

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,240
I've noticed we have a lot of great 
people is they sort of belief that their

14
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:43,560
greatness is something that can be 
replicated and I don't think it it can.

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,483
I see.
So I believe in the individual you 

16
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:46,860
don't.
That's for differences,

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,630
but the primary goal of the individual 
should be to serve the community.

18
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,643
I,
I do not believe that the primary goal 

19
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,370
of what the individual fields.
So you're,

20
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,330
you're just,
you're discounting the human spirit.

21
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,220
He was counting.
Now there is.

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,620
Let me ask you a quick no,
there's not in a humanity.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,650
Think of animals in the wild.
Even have to go to humanity.

24
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,150
We can just think about animals in the 
wild.

25
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:10,440
What is our human instinct?
Okay?

26
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,590
Are you going to make sure that everyone
on this block is fed?

27
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:15,360
Before you feed yourself?
Do you go around and say,

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,283
Hey,
have you had breakfast this morning at 

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,670
breakfast this morning?
Hey,

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,910
how are you going to make sure you're 
eating?

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,280
If you have any of you have an excess,
of course you're going to do the humans.

32
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,350
Human condition in our incentives are 
going to be one of the richest.

33
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,960
The 15 people on the planet have got as 
much cumulative.

34
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,290
Well first,
the poorest 5 billion,

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,670
but your neck.
So no,

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:35,850
no,
no,

37
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,091
no,
no,

38
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:36,960
no.
Okay,

39
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:37,681
okay.
Excuse me.

40
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,514
First and foremost,
you're talking about literally point 

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,251
two,
zero,

42
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:41,851
zero,
zero,

43
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,684
zero.
One percent of the world is what he's 

44
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,040
talking about and what are they 
preaching?

45
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,903
What do they want socialism so that 
nobody else has the opportunity to 

46
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:52,900
become what they've become.
They are the ones that are pushing it.

47
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,043
Are you kidding?
George Soros doesn't want socialist 

48
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:57,804
policies.
Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the 

49
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:00,360
world,
doesn't want socialist policies.

50
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,850
They want to make sure that no one else 
has the opportunity to get.
