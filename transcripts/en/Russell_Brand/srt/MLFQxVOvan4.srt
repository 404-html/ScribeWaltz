1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,493
Hello and welcome to this special 
edition of under the skin with me 

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,280
Russell brand.
I'll be talking to doctor professor Dr.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,060
Jordan Peterson.
I've spoken to him before,

4
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:15,690
but this special commemorative does not 
really a commemorative chat.

5
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:20,691
It's not a tea towel for the raw wedding
between Meghan markle and Prince Harry.

6
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:21,594
It's a to celebrate the release on paper
back of my book recovery and look at it 

7
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:28,920
now on Amazon.
It's six pound 50,

8
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:32,610
I think might be six pound 47 we talk 
about that book recovery.

9
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:36,330
We talk about the principles of recovery
as a road twin light meant we talk about

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,470
Dr Peterson's book.
12 rules for life is an interesting chat

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,333
talking about myth.
We do of course go for some of the main 

12
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:44,244
stays of Professor Peterson's,
a Canon of ideas that he commonly talks 

13
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:50,784
about,
but also I think we really get to the 

14
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:54,480
heart of it and discover some,
uh,

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,410
some people think there's an exclusion 
of warmth.

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,420
I think sometimes when talking about 
Peterson ideas and these,

17
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:05,421
I'm insistent on individual culpability 
and responsibility.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,750
We get into that stuff quite deeply.
I think it's a great chat.

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,733
Those.
You don't know who Jordan Peterson is 

20
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:12,580
yet?
Where,

21
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,413
where have you been?
Obviously not watching him at the 

22
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,300
Hammersmith Apollo with 5,000
others.

23
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,343
So yeah,
we were talking to Jordan Peterson and 

24
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,063
under the skin.
Thanks for joining me and do check out 

25
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:26,700
my book recovery on paperback.
Thank you

26
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,980
Dr.
Jordan Peterson.

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,800
Thank you for coming on under the skin.
It's lovely to see you again.

28
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,020
It's good to see you too.
It's nice to meet in London.

29
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,550
Yeah,
it's different isn't it?

30
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:39,180
We have,
both of us were exiled in Los Angeles in

31
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,330
our last conversation by enjoyed it very
much.

32
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:45,270
I've got a lot from it.
I'm happy to talk to you on.

33
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,750
This is very much home turf for me.
Now we're in London,

34
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,890
we're in a publishing office.
You've been promoting your book,

35
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:56,280
I presume that's why you're here.
[inaudible] and doing a public couple of

36
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:58,830
public lectures.
How do you find that now?

37
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:00,780
How do you finding what I thought in a 
way,

38
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:03,390
I've been comparing you to the British 
opposition leader,

39
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:04,224
Jeremy Corbyn in that you've been doing 
this for ages and now you're 

40
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:09,990
experiencing a,
uh,

41
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:10,824
an almost,
perhaps unprecedented level of 

42
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,603
attention,
but I'm assuming that your skillset is 

43
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,750
applicable.

44
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,720
You're a lecturer,
you're a clinical psychoanalyst,

45
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,210
so it's not like,
oh my God,

46
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,620
there's cameras.
Right,

47
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,513
right.
Well,

48
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,290
I mean,
the,

49
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,123
the large scale lectures aren't doing,
aren't that much different in kind from 

50
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:33,330
the lectures I was doing at the 
university.

51
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,460
I mean,
the venues are larger and yeah,

52
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,670
but the Hammersmith Apollo 3000 seats,
I think maybe,

53
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,500
yeah,
there were 5,000

54
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:41,550
at the Apollo.
Well,

55
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,900
that's where you're not nervous.
Um,

56
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,180
I'm not as nervous doing that as I am 
often going to talk to journalists.

57
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,990
Individual journalists.
Yeah.

58
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,080
Because like the thing about those 
venues,

59
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,660
there's a variety of things about them 
that worked in my favor.

60
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:56,490
I mean,
I like talking to crowds,

61
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,680
you know,
I've always enjoyed lecturing and so

62
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,813
lecturing to several thousand people 
isn't much different than lecturing to 

63
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:04,774
several hundred people.
But I also know that the people who've 

64
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:10,150
come are there happy to be there.
Like I'm,

65
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:10,984
I'm,
I'm speaking to a welcoming crowd and 

66
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:14,170
so,
and it's all,

67
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:17,370
all of the details are essentially under
my control so,

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,750
so it's not it I am actually enjoying it
quite a bit.

69
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,820
I mean I'm apprehensive beforehand 
because,

70
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,010
well because you should be,
you know,

71
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,933
I want to do a good job and I want to 
make sure things go well and I want to 

72
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:32,800
get through the material properly and,
and,

73
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,353
and get a little farther in my thinking 
than I have been and I'm trying to make 

74
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,570
each time I lecture better than the last
time and I don't,

75
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,230
obviously I do always don't succeed at 
that but,

76
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,500
but it's good.
I'm enjoying it and my wife is very good

77
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:48,340
travel companion.

78
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,173
She's very stable and she helps me plan 
my days and so we've got it down to a 

79
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,374
bit of a routine.
I would say Tammy is in the room with 

80
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:56,674
us.
We've already met previously in Los 

81
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,453
Angeles.
You wouldn't be on mine.

82
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,293
There isn't in my back.
It's a just in case listeners are 

83
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:06,280
wondering why perhaps they might be able
to detect in my voice.

84
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:08,770
I'm occasionally glancing towards a 
spouse.

85
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,390
The reason is because I am now,
well,

86
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,380
I'm curious,
when you're,

87
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,030
um,
doing these lectures,

88
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,280
him,
he's there not a performance component.

89
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,750
Do you not feel like,
definitely,

90
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,740
yeah.
Well,

91
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,530
sure.
I mean a lecture theater is a theater,

92
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,350
you know,
and lecture is a form of theater.

93
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,490
Now it's a serious form of theater.
But theater can be serious,

94
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,390
you know,
and,

95
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,223
and there's a seat because partly what 
I'm doing is I'm presenting ideas to an 

96
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,474
audience,
but I'm also modeling the act of 

97
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,620
engaging with ideas.

98
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:46,150
And that's the theatrical end of it.
And I don't give the same talk twice.

99
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:46,984
Like I have my stories and I have my 
collection of things I know and I talk 

100
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:51,640
about,
but I try to,

101
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,520
I try to do two things.
Um,

102
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,783
I try to,
I'm always talking to specific 

103
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:01,390
individuals in the audience and so I'm 
having a conversation with the audience.

104
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:02,224
And so that's,
that's part of the dynamic element of 

105
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:04,804
the performance.
And the other thing I'm trying to do is 

106
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:09,160
to further my thinking on the topics 
that I'm addressing.

107
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,830
And there is a theatrical element to 
that because it's,

108
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,980
it's like,
I think the closest thing really that it

109
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,814
compares to is probably stand up comedy.
Although I think the routines that 

110
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:20,674
comedians have are probably more well 
and formally practice than the ones 

111
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:25,270
that,
that you know,

112
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:26,104
than,
than the,

113
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,630
than the talks that I,
that I engage in.

114
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,260
And I don't really think of it as 
delivering a lecture to an audience.

115
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,543
I'm trying to think about complicated 
things in real time with an audience 

116
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:42,691
there to participate and to use the 
audience as an indicator of whether what

117
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:45,940
I'm saying is gripping and 
comprehensible.

118
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,290
You apprehension and,
and uh,

119
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,173
understandable.
Adrenaline prior to going on stage 

120
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:54,460
doesn't lead you to lean into a shtick,
you know,

121
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:58,250
which would be the opposite of what 
you're describing to remain

122
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,660
engaged in a kind of dialectic process 
of discovery.

123
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,640
Because I find,
I mean obviously I am a comedian,

124
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:08,060
so yeah,
for us I would argue there is a,

125
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,953
there is a distinction between 
performing for before 200 people or 

126
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:12,764
5,000
people around 200 I feel like I'm very 

127
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,090
relaxed,
I'm comfortable.

128
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:19,400
I feel like I've got a lot of space in 
there.

129
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,930
5,000
I feel like sharpen up now you've got no

130
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:27,220
room particularly because the other 
crucial difference is I,

131
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,590
there needs to be a laugh every 2030 
seconds.

132
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,750
If there isn't,
it gets pretty frosty up there.

133
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,990
He said it is appealing to me as a 
comedian.

134
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:36,824
That's interesting.
Interested in furthering intellectual 

135
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:40,934
debate,
looking at their new intersections 

136
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:46,430
between politics and spirituality.
Perhaps they've always been there.

137
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,730
These are some of these evaporating 
context,

138
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,593
the emergence of new ideas perhaps best 
exemplified by your own particular 

139
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,310
trajectory.

140
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,353
Is it interesting to me that these 
spaces are now becoming available for 

141
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:03,890
forms of types of performance that 
aren't so contingent?

142
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,640
It is on rapture her an opinion or what?
Right,

143
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:10,340
and I know it is a very strange thing 
and I'm not sure what to make of it.

144
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,740
You know,
you see Sam Harris doing something quite

145
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:14,780
similar.
Richard Dawkins is doing something quite

146
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:17,960
similar and,
and it's,

147
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,820
I mean I was thinking because I've been 
trying to conceptualize this and,

148
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,943
and one,
one comparable audience or one 

149
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:28,250
comparable situation is probably that of
of standup comedians.

150
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,383
Another I suspect are traveling events,
even evangelical types because there 

151
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,823
but,
but of course what they're doing is 

152
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:40,700
explicitly religious.
This is it.

153
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,653
This has elements of both of those.
And what's emerging that's so 

154
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,374
interesting is that there's a clear 
public appetite for high level 

155
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:51,830
intellectual conversation.
If it's,

156
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:52,664
if it's dynamic and I don't know what,
what's accounting for that all of a 

157
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:56,864
sudden,
maybe it's because these sorts of 

158
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:00,680
discussions aren't taking place.

159
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,040
Like they should in the classical media 
space.

160
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,020
You might be right there.
Jordan,

161
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,273
I mean to slightly mangle to slightly 
mangled the young quote that you use in 

162
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,800
your book.
Um,

163
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,120
12 rules I'm really enjoying actually,
uh,

164
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,023
like the one could infer motivation from
results perhaps is that the political 

165
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:24,524
discourse,
social discourse has become superficial 

166
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:30,680
and detached from meaning from purpose,
from experience.

167
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,520
That there is an opening appetite for 
substance,

168
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,770
that people are starting to what you 
know.

169
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:37,141
And,
and,

170
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,320
and as you said about theater before,
you know,

171
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:44,321
the origins of theater and the origins 
of religion a closely connected and both

172
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:47,084
of them still our debt or at least 
functionally must relate to meaning 

173
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:56,070
purpose,
giving us stories that help the

174
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,690
path.
I think that,

175
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,823
I think that's,
that's that's there's something about 

176
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:02,670
that that's profoundly correct.
I think that,

177
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,963
you know,
that the New York Times has recently 

178
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:08,520
written about the rise of the so called 
intellectual dark web,

179
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:12,180
which is a term that Eric Weinstein so 
brilliantly coined,

180
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,014
I would say.
And,

181
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,760
and very thoughtfully.
Um,

182
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,600
I think that the thing that unites the 
people who are loosely grouped into that

183
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:21,504
collection is that they are having 
serious conversations with an audience 

184
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:26,694
that they respect.
And they're very diverse range of 

185
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,780
people.
They don't certainly don't like salmon.

186
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,000
Sam Harrison,
I disagree about many things,

187
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,220
for example.
And uh,

188
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,263
but Sam respects his audiences and he's,
and he's engaging them in extremely 

189
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:41,424
serious discourse about very deep topics
now about the structure of reality 

190
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:46,224
actually.
And,

191
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,690
and the relationship between science and
religion and,

192
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,910
and,
and the,

193
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,133
and I think it is a consequence of the 
fact that not only has our public 

194
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:55,854
discourse,
let's say in the media and in politics 

195
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:57,834
become shallow.

196
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,110
I think it's become unbearably shallow 
in the universities.

197
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,640
So,
yeah.

198
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:05,160
Well,
because it's become so ideological,

199
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,680
you know,
and it's just not helpful.

200
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:08,514
Look,
I was interviewed by a New York Times 

201
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:10,810
journalists last week.
Uh,

202
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,993
Nelly was her name and she's going to 
publish this on Sunday and she did a 

203
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:16,284
literature degree at Columbia.
And she told me that she was quite 

204
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,410
appalled actually by her degree.
Uh,

205
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,590
especially in,
in,

206
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,513
in hindsight,
she told me that she didn't know until 

207
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,863
she graduated,
that there was any other way of reading 

208
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:32,640
great literature then through a 
postmodern Lens.

209
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:36,990
And the postmodern lens takes a book and
basically you take a book,

210
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,940
whatever it happens to be,
and you decide which power hierarchy the

211
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:46,941
author was serving and who's who he's ex
or she has excluded from consideration.

212
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,310
So it's completely read through a 
political lens as if the book is nothing

213
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:54,540
but a tool of political and economic 
domination essentially.

214
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,100
And that's the assumption.
And like,

215
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,263
look,
everything's contaminated by politics 

216
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:01,180
and power to some degree.
Right?

217
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,363
But that doesn't mean that there's 
nothing to art and literature except in 

218
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:08,850
service of,
of like group domination.

219
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,920
It's an appalling way of looking at the 
world.

220
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,783
It would be an extraordinary bias to 
bring to Jane Eyre is very difficult to 

221
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:18,270
sort of make sense of it through that 
Lens.

222
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,310
Of course you have economics and 
politics who would like,

223
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,263
yeah,
of course important themes are going to 

224
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:24,870
be present in great works of art.
But,

225
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:25,704
uh,
I,

226
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,140
I'm in chess,
there's still great works of art.

227
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,131
Yes.
The thing,

228
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:30,120
and it's like,
well,

229
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:32,820
even even with something as transient as
comedy,

230
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:34,170
let's say,
I mean,

231
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,740
you can't reduce comedy to the political
or the economic and,

232
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:38,520
and,
and,

233
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,353
and comics who become too ideological,
let's say like musicians who become 

234
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:45,930
ideal to ideological.
They're just not funny anymore.

235
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,970
You have to be,
I mean,

236
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:49,980
you can have your viewpoint left to 
right.

237
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:51,360
That's fine.
And people do,

238
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:55,210
but you have to be able to that 
viewpoint continually and you have to be

239
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:56,310
able to criticize it,
right?

240
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,830
Because otherwise you're not a music.
You just become a demagogue of sorts.

241
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,280
Yes.
I would agree that once there's a rubric

242
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,263
to which you

243
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,020
come in slave,
that becomes a dogmatic then,

244
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:11,530
then there's no room for nuance.
There's no room for hypocrisy.

245
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,380
Humor,
they're transcendent mirth,

246
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,170
chaos.
These forces need to be unleashed.

247
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:17,300
Yeah.

248
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,780
I think there's also things you can no 
longer laugh about because you're,

249
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,390
you know,
you're so committed to your axioms,

250
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,200
you can't,
you,

251
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,230
you dare not transgress against them.
And if that's deadly,

252
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:29,990
if you're a comedian,
because the rule for comedy would be,

253
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,350
and this is something I like about,
about Sarah Silverman for example,

254
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:36,410
is she will say anything if she thinks 
it's funny.

255
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,960
She's very daring in that manner.
Like,

256
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:40,840
I've heard her tell jokes that,
you know,

257
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,160
really would curl your hair,
you know,

258
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:43,994
but you can tell by watching or 
something will pop into her head and 

259
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:46,814
part of her golf chase,
I don't know if I should say this and 

260
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,334
then she'll say it.
And it's often like horribly funny and 

261
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,200
horribly funny.
It's a good kind of funny,

262
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,580
I mean it's,
it's,

263
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,180
it's daring and,
and it's something I really admire about

264
00:12:59,181 --> 00:13:00,470
comedians too,
is that they'll,

265
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,630
they'll take that risk.
And,

266
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,003
and it's something also that I've found 
disturbing about with regards to the 

267
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:11,744
many things I find disturbing about 
university campuses is that so many 

268
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:14,924
comedians won't go perform on university
campuses anymore because they can't be 

269
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:23,200
funny.
People get offended and it is a false,

270
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,770
so fen offended.

271
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,870
I think you're right.
I mean,

272
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,960
I think it's like a kind of Simon says 
type of,

273
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,220
uh,
like him.

274
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:32,050
Do you know that game?
Do you have that game in your language?

275
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:32,884
It's just like,
are there certain things that we know 

276
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:34,954
we're not allowed to say?
There's certain things that we know 

277
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:39,460
we're supposed to think.
There's a kind of a,

278
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,090
a kind of form you like dance,
a courtly behavior.

279
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:48,210
I've heard it referred to as that we are
meant to pay homage to a particular type

280
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,434
of set of protocols and manners and it's
not necessarily anchored to a real 

281
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:58,300
morality is not anchored to a sort of a 
sense of spirit.

282
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,313
So we sense of love or kindness is about
like these are the rules that we abide 

283
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:03,454
by.
Hm.

284
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,653
I want to talk to you a bit about the 12
steps and the model for handling 

285
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:09,244
addiction that I've written about myself
in my book recovery cause I want to see 

286
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,860
what you think of it a lot.

287
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,280
So like the 12 steps have anonymous 
fellowships,

288
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:20,110
which I,
if I were to belong to them,

289
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:22,660
I wouldn't be able to say who it 
belonged to them without breaching their

290
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,430
code of anonymity.
But,

291
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,190
uh,
the,

292
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,920
uh,
what's positive about,

293
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,260
uh,
this approach to addiction is a,

294
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:31,130
as we have discussed off Mike,
uh,

295
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,720
that it creates community like the other
people that have got a similar endeavor.

296
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:35,680
And in fact,
it was young,

297
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,460
the identified,
uh,

298
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,350
this,
uh,

299
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,183
this solution.
He said that like people who have got 

300
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:44,440
chronic addiction addiction issues will 
struggle to change.

301
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:47,950
And that's to have a spiritual 
realization of some kind and the support

302
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:48,760
of a community.
Yeah.

303
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,980
Well I'm the spiritual realization 
component that's actually supported by

304
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,813
the relevant addiction literature.
One of the classic cures for addiction 

305
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:56,954
is spiritual transformation.
And the hardcore scientists have have 

306
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,643
laid that out as,
as a reality in the addiction 

307
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:03,050
literature.
Agree.

308
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:03,884
Because these more secular language 
around that a spiritual transformation 

309
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:07,544
could just be a change of perspective or
a renewal radical change of perspective 

310
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,550
from an,
and it typically,

311
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:16,340
in my experience,
that's from a self centered view as self

312
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:18,890
obsessive view about getting your own 
needs met.

313
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,640
Uh,
solid cystic narcissistic perspective of

314
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:23,474
low life is this is just an adventure 
where I go around trying to key millay 

315
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,730
and accrue to,
Oh wow,

316
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:29,564
I'm here to be of service.
That's of the transition in ride 

317
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,433
microscopically.
But in addition to a community like 

318
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,290
having connections between one another,
the 12 steps themselves,

319
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,124
I think are an interesting model for 
transformation and shouldn't be 

320
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:47,780
overlooked.
And in fact,

321
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,850
what my book was about.

322
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,943
Canton,
could that method be transposed to 

323
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,500
anybody who's interested in change?
So I wanted to talk to you about that,

324
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:57,740
to get your perspective on them.
The first step is acknowledging that you

325
00:15:57,741 --> 00:16:01,100
were powerless over your addiction and 
your life has become unmanageable.

326
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,890
Just admitting this,
I don't want to be in this situation.

327
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,820
Okay,
so two,

328
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,840
there's two parts to that admission.
A one is that you're in trouble.

329
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,450
Yeah.
And I guess there's three.

330
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,343
You're in trouble and it's serious.
Things could be better and you don't 

331
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,950
have the wherewithal at the moment to 
make them better.

332
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,233
So the thing that's interesting about 
that is there's a kind of radical 

333
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:24,950
humiliation and humility that goes along
with that.

334
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:25,784
So you say,
I have a problem and what I know at the 

335
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:30,410
moment isn't sufficient to solve it.
Great.

336
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,250
Because now you've opened yourself up to
the possibility of learning something as

337
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:34,641
you say,
well,

338
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:35,180
I don't know.

339
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,830
I don't know enough to fix this.
It's like,

340
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:38,270
okay,
well you could learn.

341
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,900
And one of the things that's so 
interesting about people is that if they

342
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,920
decide they have a problem and they also
noticed that they could learn,

343
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,530
the probability that they will learn 
goes way up.

344
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,993
That's very interesting.
You've actually conflated the first 

345
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:52,834
three steps there in your analysis of 
the first one because the first one is 

346
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,883
admission that there's a problem.
The second one is recognizing that 

347
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:00,794
things could improve,
like came to believe that power greater 

348
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,254
nsls could restore us to sanity and the 
third one has made a decision to turn 

349
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,960
our life and our will over to the care 
of God as we understood God.

350
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,831
So like,
you know,

351
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:10,664
yeah,
we could talk about that from a secular 

352
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:12,951
goes back.
Well,

353
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:15,260
we could talk about that from a circular
perspective and say,

354
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:16,094
well there's a,
there's a higher order moral principle 

355
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,640
that needs to be brought into the 
situation.

356
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,743
And you sort of described that right at 
the beginning of the question because 

357
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:23,774
you said,
well,

358
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,420
what?
Partly what you do when you move from an

359
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,254
addicted state,
from a psychological perspective is 

360
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:33,200
moved from a viewpoint of the 
gratification of immediate desire.

361
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,034
And,
and maybe the accumulation of things as 

362
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:38,180
a marker of success to the notion that 
no,

363
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:39,014
you actually have a higher purpose and 
that higher purpose might involve being 

364
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:44,660
of service that could be of service to 
yourself,

365
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:46,250
which means you wouldn't be addicted 
anymore.

366
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:48,590
Cause that's not a good way of being of 
service to yourself.

367
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:51,510
But I've service to yourself and the 
broader community.

368
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:55,080
However you might define that,
that's a higher order purpose and it can

369
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:55,914
integrate your motivations at at a level
that doesn't leave you at the whim of 

370
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:00,594
impulse.
That's the purpose of a higher order 

371
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:03,840
motivation.
So okay,

372
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:05,580
so we've got three yes.

373
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,803
That's the first phrase to get you to 
that position where you're willing to 

374
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,340
change,
believe in the possibility of change and

375
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,280
accept help in order to achieve that 
change.

376
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,960
The fourth and fifth steps are about 
inventorying.

377
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,970
Get like this is where the 12 step 
program becomes a fusion of spirituality

378
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:23,640
and psycho analysis.
Because the fourth step is a like a,

379
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,493
a four column method where you write 
down a list of all your resentments in 

380
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:31,080
your life or childhood resentments,
your resentments against the government.

381
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:33,750
People you work with,
you write it all down and then there's a

382
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:38,751
diagnostic tool where you identify what 
it is in you that doesn't like that.

383
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,030
And,
and also interestingly in,

384
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,440
uh,
in 12 step,

385
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,050
um,
theology that's call it,

386
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,093
it says that anything,
anytime that you are personally 

387
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:53,160
disturbed there is you have to take 
responsibility for it to a degree.

388
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,990
There is something in you that's being 
effective.

389
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:56,970
It should at least ask yourself that 
question.

390
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,430
Is it me or is it the world?
Yes.

391
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,323
Well,
let's consider first the possibility 

392
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:05,250
that it might be,
I wrote about that in the sixth rule,

393
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:08,070
right?
Put your herself how say yes,

394
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:08,731
yes,
am in fact,

395
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,630
I've got,
are the two row like my,

396
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,080
like I did a truncated and somewhat more
as,

397
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,020
uh,
linguistically explicit a,

398
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:20,100
an explorative laden version of the 12 
steps.

399
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,240
And I've got your 12 rules for life 
here.

400
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:24,060
That,
and they don't necessarily correlate,

401
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,100
but like,
cause like in instead of your first one,

402
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,600
stand up straight with your shoulders 
back.

403
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,870
I that.
So a great chapter I think I love about,

404
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,713
you know,
the lobster staff and this sort of the 

405
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,540
uh,
the ancient,

406
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,403
timeless,
all most roots of hierarchies and the 

407
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:38,040
chemicals that are at play.

408
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,873
What's happening when you're,
what does that play when we talk about 

409
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,000
self esteem?
Um,

410
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,350
I like and the year the six one set your
own house in perfect order.

411
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,184
I suppose before you criticise the world
steps four and five in the tea in a 12 

412
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:52,860
step program,
deal with that inventory.

413
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:54,780
What's going on in your life,
inventory,

414
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:56,990
what your baggage is in your own 
personal think.

415
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,710
It's very practical down.
It's like,

416
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,360
well let's say you want to fix up your 
house,

417
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,450
which is actually quite a lot like 
fixing yourself up,

418
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,710
which is a very common dream.
Metaphoric attic.

419
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,713
Well,
the first thing you want to do is go 

420
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:09,570
look around and see what needs to be 
fixed.

421
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,541
You know,
and,

422
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,510
and that's the interesting thing about 
that.

423
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,673
This is a kin to what comedians too,
is that as soon as you're willing to 

424
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:19,680
admit Comedians,
look at a problem and then rise above it

425
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:20,820
right away and make a joke about it.

426
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,270
But as soon as you're willing to admit 
that you have a problem,

427
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,823
then you're immediately contacted the 
part of yourself that's at least strong 

428
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:31,290
enough to admit that you have a problem.
And so,

429
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,190
so the act of admitting the problem is 
actually the first step to solving it.

430
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,393
You might say,
well,

431
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,420
and it's an optimistic step because you,
you might say,

432
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:41,880
oh my God,
I can't admit to I that I have a problem

433
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:43,670
because what if I can't solve it?
Or,

434
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,960
exactly.
So then maybe you won't admit to it.

435
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,280
If you do to it,
you're a simile.

436
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,123
Tanium admitting to the possibility that
you could solve it and then it can 

437
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:54,430
actually become something that's 
optimistic.

438
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,031
You can say,
well,

439
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:56,530
my life is horrible.
It's like,

440
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:59,350
okay,
but I'm doing 50 things wrong.

441
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,483
Well Great.
I could fix those things and then maybe 

442
00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:02,680
it wouldn't be so horrible.

443
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,310
It demonstrates the admission itself 
demonstrates progression and possibility

444
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:08,260
for further progression.
I think it relates,

445
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,430
that's why humility is always stressed 
in,

446
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,930
in great religious traditions.
Humility is precisely that.

447
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,340
It's like you have to look at why you're
not so good.

448
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:19,883
Yeah,
and and you know that that has to break 

449
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,680
down your pride to some degree in your 
arrogance.

450
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:24,514
It's like,
well that's great because if you break 

451
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:26,194
down your pride in your arrogance,
then your prime to learn and you can 

452
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:30,430
solve your problems.
So there's nothing in that.

453
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,100
It's a bit crushing to begin with 
because you might think,

454
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:34,330
oh my God,
they're pretty,

455
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:35,164
a lot of things wrong with me,
but at least then you're on the on the 

456
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:38,644
road to fixing them.
My pesonal Janay recovery has been a 

457
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,430
good,
like a kind of death.

458
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,061
It like,
you know,

459
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:43,894
look at that.
When I was 27 it was like the death of 

460
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:46,520
the drug addict self.

461
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,980
That guy dies funny because I told Tammy
when we were coming here today that when

462
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:53,170
you were 27 you made the decision to 
live.

463
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,440
I knew it was 27 because that's when 
people,

464
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,530
I'm going to say like cue,
but you know celebrities who,

465
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,430
who are sort of on fire,
they die all the time at 27 because they

466
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:06,370
don't make that decision.
They decided that they don't decide that

467
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:10,180
they're going to take that final step 
into maturation.

468
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,103
They want to hold on to that Peter Pan 
thing that that pause you bet you 

469
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:17,500
exactly that.
They want to hold on to that and you,

470
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,740
you can't hold onto that and live.
Yes.

471
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,633
And then there's a further death,
I'm noticing now in my early forties so 

472
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:26,051
that like,
ah,

473
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:29,680
now like the midway point at the Nicoe 
and that sort of Dante Esquire,

474
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,721
ah,
I'm,

475
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:35,060
and now I'm moving towards the grave and
now I'm at like,

476
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,003
there's a different kind of alertness 
and merging and back to this step four 

477
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,350
and 5 million in this process of 
inventorying.

478
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,830
After you've made an imagery and you've,
you've correctly,

479
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,050
you've honestly and openly put down 
everything,

480
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,200
incidents of child abuse,
things that you've said to other people,

481
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:51,034
things that your shame.
Once you've been willing to inscribe 

482
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:56,500
your shame,
then you tell another person,

483
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:59,920
a person that you trust.
In the original literature it says,

484
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:00,754
you know,
it could be a cleric or doctor or 

485
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,890
whatever.
It typically in a,

486
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,700
in 12 step structures,
it's like a mentor figure,

487
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,770
but that has the,
that's the role of confession,

488
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:11,140
which obviously a huge part of psycho 
analysis.

489
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,093
The point in your book,
I think this pertains to is when you 

490
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:14,134
took that the dragon and the dragon that
you said there was that kid's book that 

491
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:18,670
you read where it talks about the dragon
getting bigger and bigger.

492
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:19,504
If it's not identified.
I think four and five are somewhat like 

493
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:22,720
that.

494
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,231
Yeah.
We'll end.

495
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:26,410
Part of the point of that kid's book is 
that as soon as you turn around and look

496
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:28,120
at something,
it tends to shrink.

497
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,673
And that's partly because imagine that 
you have a memory that you won't 

498
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:33,940
confront.
Well,

499
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,010
there's something in that memory that's 
terrifying,

500
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,413
but,
and that means it's sort of associated 

501
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:41,320
with everything else that's terrifying.
And so it's horror.

502
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:42,154
It's a horrible,
but then when you turn around and look 

503
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:44,104
at it,
you think,

504
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,410
yeah,
it's horrible,

505
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:46,244
but it's,
it's horrible in this precise and 

506
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:48,404
defined way.
And that takes it away from all the 

507
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:51,314
other potential horrors of it.
It starts to shrink it right away and 

508
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:57,770
also makes you into the thing that can 
turn around and look at the horror,

509
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,633
which is a real,
real positive transformation lacked on 

510
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:04,970
your part.
So it's true that somehow in be in being

511
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:05,804
prescriptive and being specific,
the problem becomes manageable because 

512
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,610
otherwise it's limitless.

513
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,820
It becomes a apocalyptic in the end is,
well,

514
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,300
what's the worst thing that's Kevin is I
could be destroyed.

515
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,930
And everyone I love could be destroyed 
and of itself could be destroyed.

516
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,010
And until you say,
well,

517
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:22,844
actually,
you know what this is is you feel 

518
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:25,910
inadequate because you weren't role 
models.

519
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,530
Correct.
There's all right,

520
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:29,630
well I can maybe take care of that.
It's still bad,

521
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:31,160
but it's not everything.
And then you,

522
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,103
you phrased that exactly right is that 
without that attentive delimiting it 

523
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:37,360
becomes apocalyptic.
That and that,

524
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:38,930
that's a very,
very old idea.

525
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:42,260
So one of the things that happens in the
Mesopotamian creation myth,

526
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:45,790
the Enuma elish is that the guards are 
created there.

527
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,540
There,
there are the offspring of chaos.

528
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,403
That's a good way of thinking about it.
And they become very careless and they 

529
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:54,560
destroy their category system.
They destroy their father essentially.

530
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,573
And chaos comes flooding back.
And that's what happens to people who 

531
00:24:58,191 --> 00:25:01,340
aren't looking at things and delimiting 
them properly.

532
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,410
They become up apocalyptic and do the 
mint.

533
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,903
So,
but sometimes in a nithya there is the 

534
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,510
positive,
um,

535
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,290
fantech confronting of the God aeg 
Prometheus's.

536
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:15,980
So sometimes we need to steal,
steal the fire.

537
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,650
Sometimes we need to challenge these 
orthodoxies,

538
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,110
don't we?
Yesterday?

539
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,100
Absolutely.
I mean part,

540
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:22,934
part of the,
well part of the death that you're 

541
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:27,020
describing is actually the confrontation
with a form of tyrant.

542
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,470
Like your previously addicted self was 
the tyrant over your emergent self.

543
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,543
Yes.
And so it's an internal tyrant and you 

544
00:25:36,141 --> 00:25:38,300
said it was predicated on a false value 
system.

545
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,223
That's a false set of God's essentially.
And so you had to confront that that is 

546
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:42,344
a kind of death.
I also think that some of the addiction 

547
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,163
or addictive tendencies,
and I don't mean as severe as chemical 

548
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:47,774
dependency or forms of addiction 
addiction or a kind of self constructed 

549
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:53,960
formaldehyde to preserve you in the 
state of trauma,

550
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,610
that trauma is acknowledged.

551
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:00,290
No means to navigate trauma are present 
because of the isolation.

552
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,300
Because you have no mentor,
you have no,

553
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,330
you have no doc Trin,
you have no community.

554
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,420
So addiction steps in,
this is how our preserve,

555
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,050
this is how I will not die.
I will find this repeat notice.

556
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:14,930
There is a habit,
a repeated pattern to sustain you,

557
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:19,070
a holding pattern so that you don't die 
because there is no way out.

558
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:20,590
There's no guide,
there's no path.

559
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,390
You'll just in the forest and there 
isn't a way out.

560
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,130
So I feel that addiction for a personal 
experience and that I,

561
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,133
I hope and suspect more broadly is a 
means for sort of status for 

562
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:33,620
preservation.
After trauma,

563
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,603
the rupture occurs is not addressed and 
a means for survival and merges in the 

564
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:40,280
form of addiction.
Addiction is not your nemesis.

565
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:41,820
He is your friend at least while you're,
you know,

566
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,940
in,
whilst you're in war,

567
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,250
there's certainly a literature

568
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,083
on addiction that indicates that many 
people use addictive substances as a 

569
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:51,840
form of self medication and they tend to
find the drug that best,

570
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,180
best medicates them,
let's say,

571
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,250
and for different people.
That's different drugs.

572
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,250
Yes.
Yeah.

573
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,323
Now see,
one of the other things that I'm 

574
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:06,141
proposing in my book is to use Roth 
grandiose terminology is that the,

575
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,823
uh,
that the template for a recovery from 

576
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,663
obvious forms of addiction could be 
applicable to less evident forms of 

577
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:17,004
addiction.
I eat just patterns and habits and 

578
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:22,080
because we're so far,
the things you've laid out would be,

579
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,060
would be in keeping with that idea.
Well,

580
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:26,580
you admit to the problem.
I really also,

581
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:27,414
I think the idea of laying out your 
resentments is unbelievably useful 

582
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:32,124
because that's also a way of dealing 
with the malevolence within you that 

583
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:39,360
might interfere with your own recovery 
because you're angry at yourself.

584
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,670
If you're angry at your parents,
if you're angry at the world,

585
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,683
the probability that you're going to be 
in the mental state that's going to 

586
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:47,340
allow you to charge deposit of course 
for yourself is very,

587
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:48,174
very low.
How can you have a clear and authentic 

588
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:50,394
relationship with your wife if you've 
not correctly understood what you feel 

589
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:53,964
about your own mother?
If you feel like that you are immeshed 

590
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,783
or trapped in some way,
how am I supposed to have an or if I've 

591
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,230
not understood that if I've not gained a
new perspective,

592
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:02,960
if I've not transcended it by sharing 
it?

593
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:04,150
Another,
pursue that in,

594
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:04,984
in,
in the sleeping beauty story and the 

595
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:06,834
Disney story,
when the prince is encapsulated in a 

596
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,533
castle in the dungeon at the end and 
before he goes and rescue sleeping 

597
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:15,000
beauty,
he has to confront his terrible mother.

598
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,670
She turns into the dragon of chaos 
itself.

599
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,220
He has to use honesty and truth to 
confront her.

600
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,100
And until he does that,
he can't free the maiden from her sleep.

601
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,050
Yeah.
So that's called the,

602
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,093
that's called the freeing of the anima 
from the negative mother archetype and 

603
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,590
union psychology.
It's precisely that and that,

604
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,400
and that negative feminine will be 
overlaid on your partner unless you,

605
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,090
unless you're able to clarify it and 
clarify your relationship with it.

606
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,970
And that could be something like 
overprotection or it could,

607
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,933
you know,
in your past or it could be neglect for 

608
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:47,460
that matter or it could be the rejection
at many,

609
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:48,294
at the hands of many,
many women before you encountered this 

610
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:51,084
woman and that then you are going to 
bring that bitterness forward as a kind 

611
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:54,654
of projection.
If we are unwilling to undertake this 

612
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,503
kind of excavation,
then we are doomed to continually have 

613
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:01,194
relationships that are cutaneous just to
the superficial coordinates will govern 

614
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:07,130
our experience in pronation ships.

615
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,703
So that's the repetition compulsion from
a Freudian perspective is that that 

616
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,510
isn't how Freud explained it.
That's how it union would explain it.

617
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,780
But,
but the simple explanation of it is,

618
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,110
well,
if you bring the same set of precise,

619
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,120
unexamined presuppositions to every 
situation,

620
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:26,760
the same fate will play out.
You might say,

621
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:28,020
well,
all those women are the same.

622
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:29,910
It's like,
well actually no,

623
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,223
but the part of the part of them that 
you're able to make contact with acts 

624
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:37,530
the same every time.
That's a very different thing.

625
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,870
Brilliant.
And this is where six and seven the next

626
00:29:39,871 --> 00:29:42,040
steps are chronologically occur,
but

627
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,840
there's six.
Having done this inventory,

628
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:46,990
you recognize what patterns have been at
play in your life,

629
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:47,824
which particular in the lexicon of the 
recovery defects of character of 

630
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:55,870
governed you often pride wanting to 
control other people's perspective,

631
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:57,370
self pity,
self centeredness,

632
00:29:57,371 --> 00:29:58,720
intolerance in patients,
greed,

633
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,860
jealousy,
envy,

634
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:00,850
lust,
sloth.

635
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,043
That's where you identify the seven 
deadly sins and how they play out in 

636
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:05,920
your life essentially.
Yes.

637
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,903
And so,
and you become in the six step six is 

638
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:11,020
about becoming willing to live 
differently.

639
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,060
Saying I argue,
actually willing to let go of last.

640
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,700
Are you or do you like last when it 
comes to it?

641
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:19,534
Do you like being impatient?
Does it serve you in some way to be 

642
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:24,880
slothful?
It's highly probable that it does.

643
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:25,601
Yes.
You know,

644
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:26,150
it's,
it's,

645
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,020
it's easy.
It's gratifying,

646
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,400
it's powerful,
it's pleasurable,

647
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,710
especially in the short term.
Like there's lots of,

648
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,080
there are reasons that people are 
tempted by,

649
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,020
by the seven deadly sins kind of 
glorious there.

650
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,320
Dot.
Laurie and they have a wrong,

651
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,183
that's exactly right.
There's a dark romantic and he really 

652
00:30:44,141 --> 00:30:47,500
see that in the deaths of celebrities 
around 27 is they,

653
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,513
they fall in love with the allure of 
that kind of have that romantic death 

654
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,000
and it does the men,
so the Anti Libido,

655
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:57,100
the dark libido,
the death force.

656
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,830
So with the,
once you have diagnosed,

657
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:00,664
which particular defects of character of
being most prominent in your path and 

658
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:04,624
become willing to let go of them,
this like at step seven is making a 

659
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:11,110
concerted and real effort to live 
without them.

660
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:14,710
And this is where it kind of becomes to 
sacrifice theory.

661
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,350
That's what are you willing to sacrifice
in order to move forward?

662
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:18,184
You have to give up something that you 
love and you may have to give up the 

663
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:21,004
thing you love the best.
That's the fundamental sacrificial 

664
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:23,764
Motif,
sacrifices and an unattractive idea in 

665
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:26,800
our self,
in,

666
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,470
in our society that's based on consuming
and indulgence.

667
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,180
And this is not something that I would 
lay,

668
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,670
this is again,
perhaps you were,

669
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:34,600
you and I somewhat differ is that I 
would not,

670
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,690
whilst this will not change without the 
individual's engagement,

671
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:40,120
a kind of step one and acknowledgement 
that it needs to be changed.

672
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:42,490
This is where I say there is a social 
responsibility,

673
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,503
but for whatever reason our society has 
become a manifestation of these darker 

674
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,300
impulses.
These are the prevalent foresees,

675
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,760
at least in the kind of society,
Ilumien,

676
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:53,680
I don't know what it's like to live in 
China or Libya.

677
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,753
I'm just saying like in London,
like what your kitchen with immediate 

678
00:31:58,571 --> 00:31:59,404
gratification,
too much emphasis on because immediate 

679
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:04,150
gratification is a tool of consumerism.
This would be my argument.

680
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,440
Um,
so like,

681
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,820
but at this point in the program,
it's where the,

682
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,123
the spirituality becomes,
I find personally undeniable that you 

683
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:15,430
have to,
uh,

684
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:20,050
you have to call to something else.
You have to in a sense,

685
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:20,884
be lay yourself open.
The idea of prayer becomes quite 

686
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,340
important now.
So there's a,

687
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:28,174
there's a union idea there.
So the union itself is the thing that 

688
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:34,450
guides the Eagle through 
transformations.

689
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,090
So managing the ego,
which is what you think you are.

690
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,130
Or the thing about the ego is the ego 
can be wrong

691
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,233
and the ego can die and be reborn.
So what that indicates is that there's 

692
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,163
something underneath the ego.
It can guide that process of 

693
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:48,434
transformation.
And partly what you're calling on when 

694
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:54,500
you call on this higher power is at 
least from a psychological perspective,

695
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:55,963
it's a decision to rely on that thing 
that can guide you through 

696
00:32:57,741 --> 00:32:58,810
transformation.
Yes.

697
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,430
Because surely as we said in relation to
another,

698
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,623
we are likely relate into a set of 
coordinates that we impose on Info 

699
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,163
Commerce,
the female,

700
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,730
the true same would be true of the cells
that we have created,

701
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:15,470
an impression and egoic impression.
We have constructed an artificial self,

702
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:16,304
but beneath it there is our higher self 
or an alterior self that can often 

703
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:20,714
composed of,
it's often composed of things that you 

704
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,890
refuse to or would we're willing to 
develop.

705
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:26,780
And so when young talks about,
for example,

706
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:27,614
the incorporation of the shadow was that
you've constructed a Nigo and there's 

707
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:31,244
things it can do and can't do,
that it's allowed to do and it isn't 

708
00:33:33,531 --> 00:33:34,364
allowed to do.

709
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,263
And then there's a shadow domain that 
would consist of those things that you 

710
00:33:37,371 --> 00:33:39,920
could do but haven't.
And some of that's terrible,

711
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:43,900
but some of it's what you need to break 
free w uh,

712
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,750
infinite variety in the shadow or are 
there sort of templates there?

713
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:48,620
Would you say that,
you know,

714
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:49,454
a common component of the show,
she's last aggression aggression too 

715
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,880
because they're the most,
the two that are mobilized.

716
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:56,803
Yeah.
They're the two that are most difficult 

717
00:33:57,411 --> 00:34:00,950
to integrate into the ego because 
aggression destroys and of course lost.

718
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,320
Subsumes the individual too,
too,

719
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,243
too well to sexual sexual desire is such
a lusty zipper identified as a very 

720
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:09,200
powerful self.
It can,

721
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,063
it can subsume.
So I suppose that's why a lot of 

722
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,020
theological doctrines focus on the 
control of last another.

723
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,831
There is,
of course,

724
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:19,520
it's a disruptive force,
you know,

725
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:20,354
because for example,
if you make a medium to longterm 

726
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,010
relationship with someone in knew,
negotiate that,

727
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,053
that provides you with a stable 
structure that can operate across your 

728
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:29,240
entire life.

729
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,860
It's good for you,
it's good for them,

730
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,960
it's good for your kids,
it's good for society.

731
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,990
But then if you're really attracted to 
someone momentarily,

732
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,780
you can be driven to act on that.
And every,

733
00:34:38,781 --> 00:34:41,420
all the rest of that can burn up.
It's not good.

734
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,610
And so it's no wonder that it's viewed 
as a,

735
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,683
a force of tremendous disruption.
Now it's also a force of tremendous 

736
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:48,981
life,
right?

737
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:51,140
Because you want to be attracted to 
people.

738
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,700
You want to have that,
that,

739
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,140
that vital libido is part of,
part of what's driving you forward.

740
00:34:57,141 --> 00:35:00,320
But hopefully it's on your side and not 
working against you.

741
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,620
And so,
you know,

742
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,563
if you're successful and you've put 
yourself together and you're 

743
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:05,024
disciplined,
you should still be maximally sexually 

744
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:09,740
attractive,
but it should be under your control.

745
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,550
You're not,
uh,

746
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,770
you're not the puppet of that force 
anymore.

747
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,980
It's integrated into you and that's a 
much better way to manage it.

748
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,570
How do you,
uh,

749
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,310
in your understanding,
how is the shadow incorporated?

750
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,240
What rituals,
what ceremonies,

751
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:26,180
what behaviors successfully incorporate 
a shadow,

752
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:27,014
say in the,
using the example of lust with what's a 

753
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:31,660
way back in for the sort of,
uh,

754
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,120
for,
for lust,

755
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:36,920
there's been disembodied or repressed?
What's a safe way for it back?

756
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,003
Is there one?

757
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,310
Well,
I think part of it is to,

758
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,910
is to admit to your desires within your 
own relationship.

759
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,260
You know,
cause you might say,

760
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,040
well,
I'm,

761
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,660
I'm tired of my wife.
It's like,

762
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:49,471
well,
yeah,

763
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:50,304
maybe.
Maybe you're tired of the games that 

764
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:54,060
you're intelligent enough to play with 
your wife,

765
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:56,490
but she's as plural potential as you 
are.

766
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,010
And so you have to admit to your 
desires,

767
00:35:59,011 --> 00:35:59,844
let's say,
and maybe you have to make them 

768
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:02,970
consciously manifest within your own 
relationship.

769
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,520
And then you know when people can do 
that,

770
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,550
people do that by,
by dressing up or by,

771
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,450
by playing sexually.
I would say my play exactly that play as

772
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:15,570
a transformative element.
And that's a,

773
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,703
you know,
and it might be that you're 

774
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:17,784
uncomfortable with the idea of,
of your wife as sexual play thing 

775
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:21,684
because you think that a woman who's 
married should be proper and Prim and 

776
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:26,520
should only behave sexually in a certain
way,

777
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,623
in which case,
well that becomes stale and dull and 

778
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:31,890
you're more likely to be tempted by 
something on the outside.

779
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:32,963
For me,
that's a very obvious example of how 

780
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:36,024
habitualized thinking is prohibitive 
even without reaching the extremes of 

781
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:43,350
self destructive,
addictive tendencies.

782
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:48,351
If I have a habit of regarding my wife 
as as object day,

783
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,610
even if that's not a objectification as 
we are typically taking,

784
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,180
but you know,
limiting beliefs about my wife,

785
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,640
the,
the tools that break down addictive,

786
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,503
uh,
the thought patterns could be used to 

787
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:02,160
create new terrains,
new liberty,

788
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,810
new play.
Thank you.

789
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,973
Um,
so like,

790
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,040
so once you've done up to step seven,
which is essentially the steps in,

791
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:08,874
and you're right,
it's sort of sacrifice of the old self 

792
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:13,800
and handing over to the,
some kind of sublime divine self,

793
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:14,923
um,
that that step eight is you make a list 

794
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:20,520
of people that you have harmed and 
become willing to make amends to them.

795
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:21,870
So you look back at your path and go,
God,

796
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:22,800
I shouldn't have stolen that.

797
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,750
I shouldn't have done that.
I treated that person badly.

798
00:37:24,751 --> 00:37:25,950
That was wrong.
I lied.

799
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,840
So its moral,
it becomes quite a moral monster.

800
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,210
Real repentance,
right?

801
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:31,044
And atonement atonement is at one meant.
And if you're a caring transgressions 

802
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:37,770
that you regard as transgressions now in
your life,

803
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:40,110
then you don't want to carry those 
forward.

804
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,220
You want to,
you want to,

805
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,173
you want to step forward in life without
that moral burden because you will have 

806
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:47,310
contempt for yourself otherwise and you 
won't take care of yourself.

807
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,460
It also,
uh,

808
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,703
in a sense we were talking about it,
about allowing lust backend incorporate 

809
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:55,530
in last just then,
uh,

810
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,373
this is a more,
a broader method for incorporating 

811
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,160
annexed aspects of the self.
Like,

812
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:03,450
you know,
how can you fully love,

813
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:07,830
how can I fully love myself if I know I 
treat it that person abominably well,

814
00:38:07,831 --> 00:38:11,220
if I go back and say that was wrong,
I did you wrong.

815
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,260
I owe you an amends.
You are,

816
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,740
you invite that part of your life in,
you amend your path through life as well

817
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:19,640
as teaching yourself that that is not 
the way we proceed any more.

818
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,140
That's their pay.
And,

819
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,320
and that's a real,
that's,

820
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,990
that's taking our,
that's real action in the world.

821
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:26,910
It's not a hypothetical at that point,
right?

822
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,510
It's kind of like telling people what 
you've written down about your,

823
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:31,920
uh,
about your faults.

824
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:32,820
Yes.
Yes.

825
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,110
Because it makes it real.
When you,

826
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,890
when you're acting it out with someone 
else,

827
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:37,570
it's not only a mental thing at that 
point.

828
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,870
Furthermore indicates step by step eight
is done separately.

829
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,390
The step eight is right out the list.
People.

830
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,630
Step nine is now going through it.
It makes the distinction,

831
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:48,760
I think to create a space for you where 
you're not going,

832
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,200
where you're not continually thinking.

833
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,030
I don't know if I can do in that.
I'm not going to apologize.

834
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,680
I was abused by them.
Fuck that.

835
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:56,470
They did as much wrong as I did,
which is not the point,

836
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,580
right?
It's not the point.

837
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,360
And also I think we might've done more 
wrong than you do.

838
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,233
Yes,
but you're still stuck with the fact 

839
00:39:02,411 --> 00:39:03,940
that you did something wrong.
That's wrong,

840
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:04,774
that's not good.
And if you refuse to surmount the 

841
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:09,310
obstacle over,
like you know,

842
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:12,610
some arbitrary measure of who is more 
wrong,

843
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,620
then you continue to cast yourself in 
victim hood.

844
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:19,770
You have no personal autonomy shoes to 
go for it.

845
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,043
It doesn't matter if you're only 5% at 
fault and it also doesn't matter if the 

846
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:25,930
other person apologizes to you.
They should.

847
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:28,420
It would be better for them.
It might make things worse.

848
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,640
Layout,
that's not the point and this perhaps is

849
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:35,641
where what I think is significant that 
now your life has become not negotiation

850
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:39,700
between you and other billy beings as 
they materially present themselves,

851
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,540
but between yourself and this higher 
purpose that has been declared earlier,

852
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,850
that you are now operating on the in a 
very calm,

853
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:47,020
a spiritual plane.

854
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,490
You are no longer about.
If I do that,

855
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:51,010
I'll get that.
It precisely doesn't matter if they have

856
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:52,810
a person goes,
I don't care if you apologize or not.

857
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:53,644
Super religious language that would be 
expressed as the discovery of your 

858
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:57,994
father in heaven instead of your earthly
father because your father in heaven 

859
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:05,720
would be the higher spiritual authority 
to which you all allegiance.

860
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,640
And you can think about that either in 
religious terms or a nonreligious terms.

861
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:13,690
Is that what you've done is you've in 
some sense as you've abstracted the,

862
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:14,883
the idea of a higher authority and a 
higher purpose and you've decided to 

863
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:19,114
devote yourself to that.
That's a religious app and that's 

864
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:24,790
precisely antithetical to postmodernism 
is saying that they're,

865
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:25,121
no,
no,

866
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:25,451
no,
no.

867
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:27,430
There is an essence,
there is a category,

868
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,900
there is a way.
There is.

869
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,010
That's right.
That's,

870
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,500
that's,
that's what is precisely antithetical.

871
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,613
Yes.
Because the postmodern claim is that 

872
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:36,670
there are multiple ways of looking at 
the world.

873
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,440
Many ways that's true,
but the antithesis of that is yes.

874
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,274
Just because there's multiple ways of 
looking at the world doesn't mean there 

875
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:46,280
are multiple proper ways of looking at 
the ways.

876
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,163
In fact,
there's a very narrow range of proper 

877
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:50,590
ways of looking at the world.
My,

878
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,550
uh,
my concern with atheism has always been,

879
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,690
it's sort of easy affiliation with 
nihilism or why don't we just wondering,

880
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,610
it's not fucking people.
Then that sort of like,

881
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:03,010
that's like,
that's where my mind immediately goes,

882
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:03,844
if there is not an order,
why not just smash everything to 

883
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:06,814
smithereens?
And you're saying ideologically that is 

884
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:11,290
what's happening ideologically with 
deconstructing God.

885
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:13,960
We are de deconstructing morality 
without for sure do gender.

886
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:14,794
We're deconstructing that was the danger
that both both nature and dusty Husky 

887
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:18,190
pointed to clearly.

888
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,023
It's like you dispense with the 
transcendent principle and you open up 

889
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:25,090
the landscape for impulsive nihilism.
What are they responding to?

890
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:27,070
Post enlightenment rationalism?
Is that,

891
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:29,430
what does the Husky in nature responding
to why they run,

892
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,350
responding essentially to the idea of 
the death of God,

893
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,670
both of them and,
and that explicitly.

894
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:37,100
And he's that an enlightenment idea.
Like where is that?

895
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:39,920
Where he's deaf of God happened in the 
house.

896
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,783
Should be at the hands of a,
of a kind of arrogant and narrow 

897
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,580
rationalism and the materialism.
Yeah.

898
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,440
And the exposition of,
or the,

899
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,620
the exponentially that has led us to 
where we're going now,

900
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:53,250
which is a kind of,
okay,

901
00:41:53,251 --> 00:41:54,084
we're,
we're sort of digging the earth from 

902
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:57,690
beneath our feet,
putting ourselves into the abyss.

903
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,760
That's right.
That's,

904
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,560
that's the,
that's the hypothesis.

905
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,150
Precisely.
Yes.

906
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,253
10,
11.

907
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,450
The last three steps.
Step 10 is,

908
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,180
uh,
like a continue to make inventory.

909
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,430
So like let this process continue like 
on a day.

910
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,850
For me in psycho analytic terms,
I see a therapist obviously like,

911
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,700
like it's when like when there's a 
moment I know any spike in my energy.

912
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,510
If I go,
oh,

913
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,343
I felt something that was interesting.
I felt jealous there or I felt I felt 

914
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,770
small in that moment.
These are the moments I know and go,

915
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:29,120
well,
how was I participate in that?

916
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:31,070
What belief of mine was being 
challenged?

917
00:42:31,071 --> 00:42:31,904
Is that a helpful belief?
Belief being a thought that I like 

918
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:38,660
having an 11 right?
That's a kind of consciousness is like,

919
00:42:38,661 --> 00:42:39,710
well,
I'm going to fall apart.

920
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:42,080
I'm going to make mistakes.
I don't want to make mistakes.

921
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:42,914
I'm going to keep an eye out for when I 
do make mistakes and I'm going to make 

922
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:47,210
them conscious and then I'm going to try
and work on them.

923
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,103
Yes.
Bringing them into into consciousness 

924
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:52,410
cause my fear,
my number one thing on a personal level,

925
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,220
possibly on a social level,
I don't know quite how to extrapolate or

926
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:58,430
conflate those two notions is 
unconsciousness.

927
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:01,640
I've get very afraid when I'm dealing 
with unconscious individuals.

928
00:43:01,641 --> 00:43:02,474
When Pete,
when I'm,

929
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,940
people don't know why they're doing what
they're doing.

930
00:43:04,941 --> 00:43:05,774
You may see this in sort of violent rage
or even in less dramatic or theatrical 

931
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:10,934
behaviors.
And I feel there's a great idea that 

932
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,083
lurks at the bottom of the Christian 
mythological tradition is that a little 

933
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:21,080
bit of consciousness destroyed the 
original paradise.

934
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:23,750
We became conscious enough to be aware 
of our own mortality.

935
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,390
But the cure for that is way more 
consciousness,

936
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,480
not a return to unconsciousness.
Yes,

937
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,370
there's no going back.
There's no going back.

938
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,280
I sometimes think the plethora of Zombie
movies is,

939
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:36,230
you know,
they don't know they're already dead.

940
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,573
Um,
like so like that danger of the Zombie 

941
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:42,350
is the danger of the desire for 
unconsciousness as a,

942
00:43:42,351 --> 00:43:44,840
as a solution to life's problems.
And I think that this is again,

943
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:45,674
something we're being invited to 
participate in through consumerism that 

944
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:51,560
live your life continually on the 
frequency of unconscious energy,

945
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:53,930
such as desire and fear that we're not 
being,

946
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,780
we're not being invited to participate 
on their level of consciousness,

947
00:43:56,781 --> 00:43:58,880
conscious interaction,
presence in the moment.

948
00:43:58,910 --> 00:43:59,743
While you could make that case if you 
made the case that consumerism promotes 

949
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:05,750
the gratification of immediate desires 
above all else.

950
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,950
I think he does.
That's my,

951
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:11,570
that's what I'm pushing forward with 
this original sin like,

952
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:13,130
so a little bit of consciousness is a 
dangerous thing.

953
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:14,900
We've become aware of our vulnerability,
our mortality,

954
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:17,600
our nakedness,
corporeal nature.

955
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:21,590
But the solution to this is to,
to become more conscious to,

956
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:22,640
we have to.
So,

957
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:23,420
uh,
how do you,

958
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,253
how was that?
Did you have the whole rest of the 

959
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:27,410
Bible?
Yes.

960
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,653
Grinding.
Where does that get resolved now when 

961
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:31,560
they get kicked out of the garden?

962
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,040
Part of,
part of what happens in,

963
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:35,874
in the,
in the redemptive story is if you think 

964
00:44:38,281 --> 00:44:39,114
about Christ as a symbolic figure,
say a symbolic of the process of 

965
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:44,550
transformation that we just described is
one of the,

966
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,473
one of the morals of the Christian 
passion is that you need to radically 

967
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:49,854
accept your limitations.
And so part of this keeping your sins 

968
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:54,840
before your eyes,
which you just described,

969
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:57,750
here's all the ways that I fall short of
the glory of God.

970
00:44:57,751 --> 00:44:59,090
Let's say,
you know,

971
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,840
I make this mistake,
I make this mistake,

972
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:03,960
I made this mistake.
That's all consciousness.

973
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,250
And it's painful,
right?

974
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,750
Because you think,
well,

975
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,673
you become more conscious.
It's this glorious process of 

976
00:45:09,661 --> 00:45:11,280
enlightenment.
And overall it is.

977
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:12,114
But the details are exactly this.
The things you need to become 

978
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:16,950
consciousness,
conscious of our precisely,

979
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:19,680
those things that you least want to 
become conscious of.

980
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,310
And that this is the Motif that you've 
identified in the alchemical tradition,

981
00:45:23,311 --> 00:45:26,760
because the whole chemical,
the chemical motto,

982
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:27,743
so to speak,
was that which you most need to be 

983
00:45:29,551 --> 00:45:32,040
found,
that which you most need to find will be

984
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:34,920
found where you least want to look.
Right?

985
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,750
Yes.
And everyone knows that's true.

986
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,820
Like you tell someone that they go,
oh yeah,

987
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:39,331
yeah,
yeah,

988
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:39,871
that's,
yeah,

989
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:41,370
I know that's true.
So,

990
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,620
and that's also the greatest barrier to 
enlightenment,

991
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:45,930
because if a night moon was all,
you know,

992
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,970
tulips and,
and sunshine,

993
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:50,070
then everyone would be enlightened.
But it's not.

994
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,920
It's this continual bringing before 
yourself,

995
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,250
all your proclivity for,
for transgression.

996
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,653
And that's that and that obviously 
because how are you going to solve your 

997
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:01,550
problems if you're not aware of them?
Hey,

998
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,750
we don't want to,
we all discipline today,

999
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,710
Jordan.
Well,

1000
00:46:04,711 --> 00:46:08,460
it's not surprising,
but the alternative is far worse.

1001
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:12,360
That's the thing and that is the display
because I was very curious.

1002
00:46:12,361 --> 00:46:13,740
I was very curious.
Like I said,

1003
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:15,450
I talked about this with Tammy when you 
were coming here.

1004
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:18,960
I thought Russell decided to live when 
he was 27 I can't.

1005
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,990
I would like to know why.
So why did you make the decision to,

1006
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:27,960
to not allow what was consuming you to 
kill you?

1007
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,223
In a sense,
he was taken out of my hands for the 

1008
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:31,894
first time.
I encountered positive of male or 40 

1009
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,340
figures,
curiously like,

1010
00:46:36,341 --> 00:46:39,370
or at least that we're able to address 
that in particular,

1011
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,210
I was sent to a treatment center.
I had free months.

1012
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:46,030
I had time to think.
I had time to let I,

1013
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,140
I passed from childhood directly into 
addictive behaviors.

1014
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:50,974
In fact,
those addictive behaviors are already 

1015
00:46:51,701 --> 00:46:54,680
present in childhood in a less toxic 
form in a,

1016
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:56,110
my relationship.
In retrospect,

1017
00:46:56,111 --> 00:46:58,360
we've,
chocolate was addictive.

1018
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,910
My relationship with pornography as an 
adolescent addictive,

1019
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:05,440
I was using it to,
for medical medical purposes.

1020
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:06,483
So,
so when substances became an option in 

1021
00:47:09,281 --> 00:47:11,350
adolescents,
it was seamless.

1022
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:16,500
And that meant that my emotional and in 
my emotional growth was arrested at that

1023
00:47:16,511 --> 00:47:18,610
point.
The reason I was able to stop is because

1024
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,560
inadvertent,
I was offered help.

1025
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:21,423
I got,
I was given help our people that the 

1026
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:26,590
management company that was working with
your cf of drug addicts,

1027
00:47:26,591 --> 00:47:27,550
you should go away.

1028
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:28,523
Okay.
So partly that meant that re they 

1029
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:30,250
regarded

1030
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,100
you as the sort of valuable commodity 
that was worth preserving.

1031
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,080
Yes.
There was a degree of that,

1032
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:35,710
right?
Well,

1033
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:36,670
no,
but that's helpful.

1034
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:38,240
I mean,
regardless,

1035
00:47:38,241 --> 00:47:40,480
so even if it's purely an economic 
interest,

1036
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,400
there's,
so there's something to that.

1037
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,413
Yeah.
So and so then you went into treatment 

1038
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:47,560
and you found some people that I went,
it was run by an atheist,

1039
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,200
a chip Thomas,
but the 12 step principles,

1040
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,510
you can't unpick it from the Oxford 
Group.

1041
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:54,610
First Century Christian group.
You know,

1042
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:55,800
there's the,
and the,

1043
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,180
and I'm,
for me it's more appealing when you talk

1044
00:47:58,181 --> 00:48:01,000
about it in Uni in terms of though I 
have no problem with the sublime and the

1045
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:03,100
divine live for that shit.
But like,

1046
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,310
like I was always trying to get out of 
my head off my face.

1047
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:07,144
Those were the things I wanted a sublime
experience and experience of what is 

1048
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:11,410
beyond the material.

1049
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:13,860
That's what I want to know.
So like it was,

1050
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:14,703
but once I was in that environment and 
like given drugs to help where I was 

1051
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,810
addicted to opiates,
so I recommend a drug called subutex Dan

1052
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:24,310
and sleeping pills because I couldn't 
sleep.

1053
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,443
And during that time,
I suppose in a way I didn't fully 

1054
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:31,060
address the issue of addiction because 
my,

1055
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,960
I was really promiscuous for about a 
decade that I,

1056
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:35,803
those,
that behavior was transplant it kind of 

1057
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:38,884
effortlessly.
But I do remember a kind of moment of 

1058
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,153
epiphany.
Epiphany is revelation of previously 

1059
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:47,410
concealed truth when it first occurred 
to me,

1060
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:48,283
you,
I suppose you don't have to take drugs 

1061
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:50,434
every day.
I remember that thought entering and it 

1062
00:48:52,031 --> 00:48:53,110
being sort of like,
oh yeah,

1063
00:48:53,111 --> 00:48:55,420
I'd never thought about that cause that 
will,

1064
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:58,180
I'd found a solution.
It worked in,

1065
00:48:58,181 --> 00:48:59,014
worked as a way of managing pain,
prevent in forever mental investigation 

1066
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:04,174
or discovery of conclusions that would 
have been unhelpful and that wouldn't 

1067
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:07,570
have been able to deal with.

1068
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,880
I think in a lot of cases,
and I'm sure there's many,

1069
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:11,260
many variables,
uh,

1070
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:11,981
that,
uh,

1071
00:49:11,981 --> 00:49:12,814
that actually chemical dependency as a 
successful technique for preventing 

1072
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,720
suicide.
That there is just,

1073
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,760
this is a holding pattern to stop me 
doing something more dramatic and band,

1074
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,560
unless people have access to an 
ideology,

1075
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:29,080
a structure and support that will help 
them through that.

1076
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:31,030
There's,
it's very difficult to overcome.

1077
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:31,864
And I was fortunate in that I was 
granted that and then granted this 

1078
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:35,890
system.
And so,

1079
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:36,724
and as I've been working in it,
I've come to the conclusion that it is 

1080
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,283
possibly universal,
not because I think it's derived from 

1081
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:48,090
universal ideas.
That's why I think young I made that,

1082
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,600
that identified,
Oh,

1083
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:50,320
if,
if some,

1084
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,440
like if there's a spiritual experience 
and then the support for community,

1085
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:58,330
that's how someone could be stopped from
drinking continually alcoholic drinking.

1086
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,433
And then they took this process where 
the 12th original 12 step fellowships 

1087
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:08,130
took the Oxford group had a program of a
sort of redemption and restitution and,

1088
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,313
and like it seems initially in a,
I think in a materialistic society 

1089
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:15,634
counter intuitive to think that the 
solution to addiction is going to be 

1090
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,160
super spiritual awakening.

1091
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,290
But that's what it is.
And the,

1092
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,690
the final steps,
I'll stay connected once you wrote,

1093
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,920
like you're continually inventorying the
moment we think,

1094
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,210
oh,
I felt something there.

1095
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,633
Yeah.
That you want to be in the moment 

1096
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,980
connected.
Like,

1097
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,833
and I have to know is if I,
if someone makes me feel inferior or if 

1098
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,830
someone,
if I'm sexually attracted to someone,

1099
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:40,664
those are the most obvious examples of 
something that will take me out of my 

1100
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:46,550
connection and that the,
the final step is,

1101
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,450
uh,
made it,

1102
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,160
is,
uh,

1103
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,030
help others and remain awake.
Right.

1104
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,710
Well that's the end of the hero's 
journey is once you go into the darkness

1105
00:50:56,711 --> 00:50:59,550
and find something of value,
the next thing to do is to distributed,

1106
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:02,860
distributed within the community to 
bring it back and distributed within the

1107
00:51:02,861 --> 00:51:04,500
community.
Yes.

1108
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:05,643
Now told and D is it like it would be 
difficult for me to accept that you've 

1109
00:51:09,101 --> 00:51:14,101
not been a sort of personally affected 
and are not personally angry rather than

1110
00:51:14,501 --> 00:51:15,640
just,
um,

1111
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:16,853
objectively because your personal 
trajectory I suppose in the public eye 

1112
00:51:20,261 --> 00:51:21,094
at least began with the situation in 
Canada with a sort of forced speech or 

1113
00:51:25,781 --> 00:51:28,210
however it's termed now.
You know,

1114
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:31,060
so like that they,
are you able to distinguish between your

1115
00:51:31,061 --> 00:51:32,890
sort of sense of personal irritation 
because,

1116
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,360
well,
I think for most people,

1117
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:35,194
and tell me what were,
whether or not you think that he's 

1118
00:51:36,161 --> 00:51:38,080
right,
that academia seems like,

1119
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,060
um,
uh,

1120
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,653
an ancillary area.
It doesn't seem mainstream to most 

1121
00:51:43,841 --> 00:51:44,720
people.
Like,

1122
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,070
but to you it seems as though it's a 
very,

1123
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:47,950
very vital,
but you are an academic.

1124
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:48,220
Yeah.

1125
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:48,851
Well,
okay,

1126
00:51:48,851 --> 00:51:50,380
so there's,
there's two things there.

1127
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:54,280
I mean people regard academia as 
ancillary,

1128
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:55,203
but it's not the reason.
It's not as because the universities 

1129
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,173
train the people who run things and so 
whatever's mainstream in the 

1130
00:52:04,511 --> 00:52:08,080
universities right now,
even though it's separate from society,

1131
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:11,980
is going to be mainstream everywhere 
five years down the road.

1132
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,203
And so that's,
that's a big brawl against the vanguard 

1133
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:16,020
academia.
There's no,

1134
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,540
do you think what's happening now in 
terms of a media and politics?

1135
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:20,140
You could,
uh,

1136
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:20,973
could say you could preemptively if 
diagnosed that from what's happening 

1137
00:52:23,111 --> 00:52:23,780
five,
10 years?

1138
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,020
No,
I,

1139
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,070
I think,
I think,

1140
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:25,904
I think that in some sense I was 
preemptively diagnosing it because I've 

1141
00:52:29,601 --> 00:52:33,800
been watching the politically correct 
postmodern types for quite a long time.

1142
00:52:33,801 --> 00:52:34,634
And one of the C,
one of the things I noticed about five 

1143
00:52:36,831 --> 00:52:38,000
years ago,
six years ago,

1144
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:40,580
there were two things that I noticed 
that I really didn't like.

1145
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:44,420
The first is that because I'm a 
personality psychologist,

1146
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,430
as a researcher,
not as a clinician,

1147
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:48,050
but as a researcher,
I,

1148
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:49,183
I know the literature on gender 
differences in personality because it's 

1149
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,334
part of my field.
And I could tell that I was starting to 

1150
00:52:56,121 --> 00:53:00,080
have some reluctance to deliver the 
lecture on gender differences.

1151
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,170
And now I didn't stop.
But I,

1152
00:53:02,171 --> 00:53:03,004
I felt,
I felt that I was treading on thin ice 

1153
00:53:06,231 --> 00:53:08,390
by delivering those lectures.
And I thought,

1154
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:09,224
oh,
that's not good because I'm like a 

1155
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:11,654
comedian.
I'm pretty much willing to say anything 

1156
00:53:13,281 --> 00:53:15,320
that I think is true and,
and you know,

1157
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,420
regardless of the consequences in some 
sense,

1158
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:19,700
because I'd rather take the consequences
of what's true.

1159
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,450
And I thought this isn't good because if
someone like me who's,

1160
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,590
you know,
rather,

1161
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,610
um,
uncontrollably mouthy,

1162
00:53:26,611 --> 00:53:29,490
let's say it's starting to have second 
thoughts about teaching,

1163
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:31,320
what's a very serious topic and,
and,

1164
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,550
and something about which there's a very
well developed science then how much are

1165
00:53:35,551 --> 00:53:38,250
other people starting to censor?
And at the same time,

1166
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,530
my students,
many of whom were female,

1167
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,573
were telling me that they were really 
hesitant to talk about gender 

1168
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,310
differences in any of the courses they 
were running.

1169
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,241
And I thought,
oh,

1170
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:50,460
this is not good.
This is seriously not good.

1171
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,510
And so,
and it's certainly the case that,

1172
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,513
that my colleagues censor themselves 
increasingly on campus with regards to 

1173
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:01,110
the topics they're willing to discuss.
And it's subtle,

1174
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:01,973
you know,
because imagine in a given lecture I 

1175
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:08,670
could discuss any of 10 things and three
of them are taboo.

1176
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:11,520
Well,
I just won't discuss those,

1177
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:12,570
you know?

1178
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:15,360
And that's that.
That's a kind of invisible censorship.

1179
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:16,770
It's not like I'll get up and say,
look,

1180
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:19,740
I could have talked to you about gender 
differences in personality,

1181
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:20,574
but I won't because I'm afraid I'll just
pick another topic because there's lots 

1182
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:24,834
of topics to choose from.
And that means there's going to be a 

1183
00:54:27,091 --> 00:54:27,924
bunch of topics that are really 
important because actually the issue of 

1184
00:54:30,421 --> 00:54:31,254
sex differences in personality happens 
to be really important that people just 

1185
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:35,304
won't talk about.
And the other thing that's so annoying 

1186
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:38,274
about this is that,
especially with regards to sex 

1187
00:54:40,171 --> 00:54:41,880
differences in personality,
well,

1188
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:45,360
let's say,
let's say that you're firmly on the side

1189
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:48,210
of women just for the sake of argument.
Well,

1190
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:52,920
you admit to or deny the existence of 
sex differences in personality.

1191
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,470
What's better for women?
Well,

1192
00:54:55,471 --> 00:54:57,300
you know,
the radical left is basically say,

1193
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:59,580
oh well those,
if you talk about sex differences,

1194
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:00,414
then you're part of the oppressive 
patriarchy and you're attributing to 

1195
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:08,010
women a different kind of temperament in
the attempt to continue the suppression.

1196
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,990
But I could just as easily say,
it's like,

1197
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:10,920
well,
wait a second.

1198
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,860
Like if you want to,
if you want to,

1199
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,713
uh,
give the individual the greatest degree 

1200
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:18,150
of freedom,
you say,

1201
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:19,560
look,
you,

1202
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:20,423
you're different from another person.
You're different on the basis of a 

1203
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:25,860
variety of your characteristics,
sex being one of them,

1204
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,790
that's going to have some effect on what
sort of choices you want to make in your

1205
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,624
life.
It's like go ahead and make whatever 

1206
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:36,180
choices you want as far as their direct 
expression of your being.

1207
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,570
And so if you deny the existence of 
these sex differences,

1208
00:55:39,571 --> 00:55:40,404
which no one,
no serious commentator in the 

1209
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:46,140
psychological literature,
in the personality domain,

1210
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:47,670
and those are the people to know about 
this thing,

1211
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:52,170
nobody debates whether or not sex 
differences in personality exist or that

1212
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:55,080
they have a biological component.
No.

1213
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:55,914
See.
And what's also interesting about that 

1214
00:55:57,541 --> 00:56:00,420
is that none of those people are 
conservatives.

1215
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:01,703
There are no conservative psychological 
researchers to speak of there in a tiny 

1216
00:56:06,151 --> 00:56:06,984
minority.
So the people that have done the 

1217
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:09,264
research indicating that there are 
differences between the sexes and 

1218
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:13,314
personality,
and that those differences have a 

1219
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:17,580
biological,
in part a biological component.

1220
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:18,803
Those are liberal and left leaning.
People who've drawn those conclusions 

1221
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,230
despite their,
you know,

1222
00:56:23,231 --> 00:56:24,064
despite what their ideological 
presuppositions might have suggested to 

1223
00:56:26,381 --> 00:56:28,330
them to begin with.
So,

1224
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:30,610
well,
so you know,

1225
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,503
it's,
I don't know what to say about that 

1226
00:56:32,531 --> 00:56:34,330
except that it's,
it's all appalling.

1227
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,393
I suppose the fear must be that 
difference will ultimately be used for 

1228
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:43,630
leverage,
for status that sure,

1229
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:46,090
that's a reasonable fear,
you know,

1230
00:56:46,091 --> 00:56:48,790
because because anything can be 
manipulated but,

1231
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:54,120
but claims of identity can have identity
claims that,

1232
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:58,690
that people are identical in some way 
can also be used for the same reason.

1233
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:02,620
You know,
if I insist that everyone is exactly the

1234
00:57:02,621 --> 00:57:03,454
same on all dimensions,
that there's just as much of a 

1235
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:05,884
totalitarian threat lurking in there as 
there is the threat lurking that we'll 

1236
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:10,570
use differences as an excuse.

1237
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:11,723
Yeah.
And we're also not having a serious 

1238
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:14,200
discussion about this.
It's like,

1239
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,230
yeah,
there are men are overrepresented at the

1240
00:57:17,231 --> 00:57:19,660
top of the economic apex.
That's true.

1241
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:23,200
It's a small minority of men by the way.
It's certainly not men in general,

1242
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,570
but they're radically underrepresented 
at the board,

1243
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,480
overrepresented at the bottom.
And believe me man,

1244
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:32,260
like nobody cares about men who are 
failures.

1245
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,800
They are like off the bloody radar.
Yeah.

1246
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:35,683
So and,
and there's no sympathy for men who are 

1247
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:37,924
failures.
So men stock up at the top and the 

1248
00:57:39,941 --> 00:57:41,410
bottom and,
and,

1249
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,333
and we don't have a discussion about 
that and we don't have a discussion 

1250
00:57:44,771 --> 00:57:49,360
about the fact that women are radically 
underrepresented in dangerous jobs,

1251
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,253
although they are or in or in or in,
in trades that require like brutal 

1252
00:57:56,111 --> 00:57:56,944
physical labor.
Women are radically underrepresented 

1253
00:57:58,900 --> 00:57:59,733
orange,
orange jobs outside women are radically 

1254
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:04,840
underrepresented.
So the complaint is always,

1255
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:07,360
well,
if you look at the top 1%,

1256
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,730
it's there are more men than there 
should be.

1257
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,980
You know,
by pure sex division.

1258
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:12,461
It's like,
well,

1259
00:58:12,461 --> 00:58:13,720
yeah,
but if you look at the bottom,

1260
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,913
the reverse is true.
So if we're going to have the 

1261
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:19,060
discussion,
which are,

1262
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:21,760
and I don't really necessarily think we 
should have that discussion,

1263
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:23,290
but if we're going to have the 
discussion,

1264
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,930
then we should look across the entire 
economic spectrum.

1265
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:31,180
I wonder how much of this debate is 
being governed by unconscious forces.

1266
00:58:31,181 --> 00:58:35,650
I wonder how much of what we're 
experiencing is a manifestation of,

1267
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,560
uh,
uh,

1268
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:39,810
on,
uh,

1269
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:44,070
we're,
we're cartography has not yet been a lot

1270
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,913
of it.
What are you thinking about any 

1271
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:47,980
particular part of it?
Well,

1272
00:58:47,981 --> 00:58:51,860
I feel like is that the reason that the 
ice,

1273
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:52,694
imagine that you are arguments that are 
based on research are so successful is 

1274
00:58:55,781 --> 00:58:56,614
because people are expressing feelings 
as opposed to cogent and researched 

1275
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:07,180
arguments.
It feels like corvair is a powerful,

1276
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,073
dominant patriarchy and no one can deny.
I mean that there is power there such a 

1277
00:59:12,431 --> 00:59:13,264
thing as power.
And there are people that benefit from 

1278
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:18,010
structures being as they are of course,
of course.

1279
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:20,350
The point of those structures being the 
way they are.

1280
00:59:20,351 --> 00:59:25,280
One of the things I've observed is that 
whenever change is discussed,

1281
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,253
you know,
and my tendency has always been to be 

1282
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:30,194
sympathetic towards movements that are 
about change or empowerment of what 

1283
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:37,610
might be termed disadvantaged groups.

1284
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:38,743
Um,
the changes or the that when you're 

1285
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,163
curious about the resistance of change 
or the different difficulties that you 

1286
00:59:44,241 --> 00:59:45,074
face when trying to bring about change,
look at who would be negatively 

1287
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:49,850
impacted,
where that change to be bought about.

1288
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:52,880
And usually that means that there's some
people for vote.

1289
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:55,940
You know,
conservatism makes sense to a particular

1290
00:59:55,941 --> 00:59:56,774
group of people.
One of the things I felt when I'm 

1291
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,490
reading a book was that,
you know,

1292
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,020
like I,
I,

1293
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:03,973
because I think you're coming from a 
perspective of psycho analysis and it 

1294
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:09,590
rings very,
the language rings true and the analysis

1295
01:00:09,591 --> 01:00:10,424
rings true.
The Wa where I feel one question that I 

1296
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:15,614
was keen to bring to you because when 
you talked about skateboarders in the 

1297
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,053
US,
I think it's the last bit one chapter 

1298
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,170
and that spirit of a,
a young people.

1299
01:00:24,171 --> 01:00:25,004
Yeah.
Courage and a willingness to try 

1300
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:28,760
dangerous things and to push forward.

1301
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:29,963
Um,
I wonder how that sits with the idea of 

1302
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:34,610
uh,
an earlier passage in the book where you

1303
01:00:34,611 --> 01:00:37,460
talk about the gratitude that we should 
feel for,

1304
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:38,294
you know,
having time to read a book and the 

1305
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:39,884
ability to read a book and sort of 
respect for the establishment and 

1306
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:46,550
systems that have been set up from which
we all benefit in it.

1307
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:47,780
Because when I,
you know,

1308
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:48,614
I,
I could find it difficult to dispute 

1309
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:54,530
your opinion about sort of a 
journalists.

1310
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:59,000
What would have been in the lexicon of 
the day socially social justice warriors

1311
01:00:59,001 --> 01:01:04,001
and that kind of some what?
Rootless unresearched rage.

1312
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:05,203
Like I identify what you're saying.
There are people that can't keep their 

1313
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:09,374
bedrooms tidy.
We have be careful before you let them 

1314
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:14,420
organize an economic system.
But like,

1315
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:15,423
but,
but similarly like in where is change 

1316
01:01:17,931 --> 01:01:19,400
going to come from?
Who are,

1317
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:21,790
who is going to challenge tyranny.
Yeah.

1318
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,990
Is it kind of thing.
Sure.

1319
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:23,843
Those are the sorts of of twin forces 
that we have to contend with across the 

1320
01:01:26,731 --> 01:01:29,760
political spectrum.
So I could run through something quickly

1321
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,670
to put the things that you just,
that you just brought up in,

1322
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,380
in,
in perspective,

1323
01:01:34,381 --> 01:01:35,101
let's say.
Okay.

1324
01:01:35,101 --> 01:01:38,940
So the first thing is,
is that hierarchies,

1325
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:41,940
if you're going to value some things 
more than others,

1326
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:43,583
then hierarchies are inevitable and you 
have to value some things more than 

1327
01:01:46,681 --> 01:01:49,710
others or you don't have anything going 
to be a or strength for something.

1328
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,410
What core competence or sure.
Whatever.

1329
01:01:52,411 --> 01:01:54,990
Whenever it happens to be the ability to
play the flute,

1330
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:56,940
right?
It doesn't matter.

1331
01:01:56,941 --> 01:01:58,200
Why on my list.
Well,

1332
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,083
what,
what do you know?

1333
01:01:59,100 --> 01:01:59,933
Obviously if you value music then you're
going to value some musicians more than 

1334
01:02:02,851 --> 01:02:04,610
others because some are better.
So as,

1335
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,920
and so you have to value things in order
to move forward in life.

1336
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,100
And you have to value things in order to
have something valuable to produce.

1337
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:13,740
But if you play out the value and the 
social landscape,

1338
01:02:13,741 --> 01:02:14,574
you're going to produce a hierarchy.
And the problem with producing a 

1339
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,334
hierarchy is that a small number of 
people are going to be successful than 

1340
01:02:20,161 --> 01:02:22,470
the majority.
And a very large number of people aren't

1341
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:25,020
going to be successful at all at,
at that particular thing.

1342
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,640
It's inevitable.
So,

1343
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:27,683
okay,
now,

1344
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,850
so,
so you wanna say while we have to put up

1345
01:02:29,851 --> 01:02:30,684
with that,
because we need to pursue things of 

1346
01:02:31,711 --> 01:02:33,030
value.
Okay,

1347
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:33,864
fine.
So that's the right wing perspective is 

1348
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:37,890
that the hierarchy's are justifiable and
necessary.

1349
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,870
Now the left wing perspective is,
yeah,

1350
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,704
but wait a minute.
The problem with hierarchies is that 

1351
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:46,380
people stock up at the bottom and that 
they tilt towards tyranny across time.

1352
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:47,483
And that's also true.
And so you need that dialectic in 

1353
01:02:49,741 --> 01:02:51,900
society between the right wing that 
says,

1354
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:52,943
you know,
we need the hierarchies and they're 

1355
01:02:54,151 --> 01:02:57,870
useful and you should be grateful for 
them and they structure you and give you

1356
01:02:57,871 --> 01:02:59,700
form and provide value.

1357
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,990
And the left that says,
yeah,

1358
01:03:00,991 --> 01:03:05,130
but they exclude people and people stack
up at the bottom and that's dangerous to

1359
01:03:05,131 --> 01:03:05,964
the hierarchy itself and it,
it means that people might not have 

1360
01:03:08,521 --> 01:03:10,920
opportunity and you have to say yes to 
that.

1361
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,250
The problem comes,
and this is the situation we're in right

1362
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:19,251
now where the radical leftists,
and this is mostly a problem that really

1363
01:03:19,411 --> 01:03:22,170
permeates the universities.
The radical left is say,

1364
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,153
yeah,
but all hierarchies are just tyrannical 

1365
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:25,434
power.
It's like,

1366
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,430
oh no,
they're not.

1367
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:27,923
Hierarchies are based on competence in 
it functioning society and mostly our 

1368
01:03:30,991 --> 01:03:33,450
society functions.
So you need it.

1369
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,293
You can't go that far.
Now that doesn't mean that the 

1370
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:42,090
hierarchy's don't tilt towards self 
interest and tyranny across time,

1371
01:03:42,091 --> 01:03:42,924
but that's a bad thing.
It's even a bad thing from the 

1372
01:03:44,551 --> 01:03:49,551
conservative perspective so well,
so there's room for the left,

1373
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:55,110
there's room for the left because the 
poor will always be with us.

1374
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,063
That's the reason that there's room for 
the left and that the dispossessed need 

1375
01:03:58,461 --> 01:03:59,294
a voice,
not least because there are talented 

1376
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:04,140
people among the dispossessed and if 
they're stuck at zero,

1377
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:07,020
everyone suffers because we don't have 
access to their talents.

1378
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,930
It's bad use of resources.
But on the right it's like,

1379
01:04:09,931 --> 01:04:11,610
no,
we need the damn value.

1380
01:04:11,611 --> 01:04:12,444
Hark is we need to be grateful for our 
traditions and our structures because 

1381
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:15,803
they,
they stop us from degenerating into 

1382
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:17,840
chaos.

1383
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,673
Also across the society,
numerous hierarchies emerge and at some 

1384
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:24,400
point decisions are being made about 
which thing,

1385
01:04:24,401 --> 01:04:24,901
you know,
easy.

1386
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:25,734
It being a brilliant flutist or 
brilliant at tennis or brilliant owning 

1387
01:04:29,591 --> 01:04:34,360
land or controlling energy resources or 
dominate in financial systems,

1388
01:04:34,361 --> 01:04:37,690
which are the hierarchies that are most 
important.

1389
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:40,290
And also the,
uh,

1390
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:44,800
what,
because like it's the way that resources

1391
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:49,540
are designated and challenging.
Those hierarchies seems to become,

1392
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,540
well almost impossible.
I'm,

1393
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:55,720
when I was leaving the hospital,
the brilliant hospital,

1394
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:58,360
they've been taking care of my mother 
recently.

1395
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:00,710
Yeah.
I sort of like,

1396
01:05:00,711 --> 01:05:01,544
you know,
the level of crisis and trauma and 

1397
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,510
tragedy there.
Excellent.

1398
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,370
They've got this sort of thing.
Best doctors,

1399
01:05:06,371 --> 01:05:10,180
that guy might in griffith that operated
on her bowel.

1400
01:05:10,181 --> 01:05:11,014
He's like a fantastic surgeon.
He is in fact him that trump was quote 

1401
01:05:14,431 --> 01:05:15,264
in when he talks about European 
hospitals with blood spattered from 

1402
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,520
knife crime.

1403
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,100
It was a sort of a mangling of a quote 
that,

1404
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,900
that this might in griffith a given and 
they're sort of like,

1405
01:05:22,901 --> 01:05:23,734
I step outside like in,
I'm driving along along white chapel 

1406
01:05:25,931 --> 01:05:30,490
road and there are um,
electronic advertising boards and it,

1407
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:31,571
the uh,
you know,

1408
01:05:31,571 --> 01:05:33,060
that require energy.
Yeah.

1409
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:34,300
So tell me to eat,
you know,

1410
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:35,134
sort of a McDonald's or kit kats or 
whatever and there's so much poverty on 

1411
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:39,874
that street.
There always has been in that part of 

1412
01:05:40,991 --> 01:05:42,670
east London,
terrible poverty.

1413
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:43,504
And I feel it was moments,
there are moments when I helicopter out 

1414
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:50,860
to the macro a perspective that no 
individual can long hold or wait.

1415
01:05:50,861 --> 01:05:53,680
That can't be long born.
But in that moment I think,

1416
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,753
why is this hospital struggling for 
resources when we can afford to run 

1417
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:02,013
electronic adverts for Mcdonald's?
Who gets to decide how collectively and 

1418
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:08,764
individually do we determine where 
resources and where power both in terms 

1419
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:14,830
of energy but also in terms of human 
power and up.

1420
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:18,280
How were these decisions made and as you
say,

1421
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:22,060
among the dispossessed there is,
they were great resources,

1422
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:22,923
great talent.
One would imagine if the research were 

1423
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:25,024
possible to the exact same degree is 
there is power and talent among the 

1424
01:06:28,481 --> 01:06:29,314
possessed because it's normally an 
accident of birth that decrees and 

1425
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:33,244
reading about your early life in Canada 
in a blue collar community and the sort 

1426
01:06:37,891 --> 01:06:41,860
of the mental health issues and the 
anger and agitation that grows there.

1427
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:42,843
So much of that is about resources,
the dispossession of the native people 

1428
01:06:46,781 --> 01:06:47,614
of that area,
the mental health issues if your friend 

1429
01:06:49,331 --> 01:06:51,460
Chris like that.
For me,

1430
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:56,110
we the are rising through these 
hierarchies.

1431
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:58,930
We that have experiences of both sides 
of that line.

1432
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:01,630
Well,
we are now challenging this evolutionary

1433
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:02,464
force.
We are now in a position to talk about 

1434
01:07:04,241 --> 01:07:05,074
these hierarchies,
how they're ordered and how they're 

1435
01:07:06,671 --> 01:07:10,060
organized and whether there is room for 
negotiation.

1436
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,860
Well,
it's up to us to do that.

1437
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:13,813
Well,
there's a risk in conservatism is 

1438
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:17,050
saying,
well this is how the cards have fallen.

1439
01:07:17,051 --> 01:07:17,510
And Yeah,

1440
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:19,730
of course there is.
That is the risk and conservatives.

1441
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:22,550
So how do we confront that?
While the risk is the,

1442
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,410
the,
the,

1443
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:26,750
the,
the hierarchies ossify and turn to stone

1444
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:27,883
and then there's no mobility.
And the idea that that things can turn 

1445
01:07:30,981 --> 01:07:33,800
to stone and they become tyrannical is 
an extraordinarily old idea.

1446
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:35,120
For example,
in,

1447
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,670
in the story of Exodus,
the story of Moses.

1448
01:07:37,671 --> 01:07:38,504
So the Egyptian,
the Egyptians are portrayed in that 

1449
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:45,080
story as tyrannical conservatives 
essentially,

1450
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:47,300
right?
And they're masters of stone.

1451
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:50,930
And Moses is a master of water.
And water is the thing that dissolves.

1452
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:51,943
And so that drama's been played out in 
these stories that are thousands of 

1453
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:55,970
years old.
And in the Egyptian story,

1454
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:58,340
the ancient Egyptian story of Ocirus and
Horace,

1455
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,533
oh,
cirrus is the old king who becomes too 

1456
01:08:01,941 --> 01:08:04,250
rigid.
And what happens to him is that he's,

1457
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:07,160
he's dismembered by evil.
That's the consequence.

1458
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:08,023
And so even the Egyptians long ago knew 
that the danger of hierarchies is they 

1459
01:08:11,331 --> 01:08:14,360
become static and corrupt and 
tyrannical.

1460
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,390
And part of what we do in our ongoing 
political dialogue and it and,

1461
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,780
and when it's genuine dialogue is to 
say,

1462
01:08:20,781 --> 01:08:22,280
well look,
are these,

1463
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,200
do these systems have it,
we need them,

1464
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:25,830
they're there not avoidable.
Uh,

1465
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,920
do they,
are they functioning properly?

1466
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:30,620
Are they loose enough so that people can
move?

1467
01:08:30,621 --> 01:08:31,454
Are they,
are they serving the broader good or 

1468
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,100
have they degenerated into something 
that's too tyrannical?

1469
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,060
Now,
you know,

1470
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:38,893
you,
you kind of pointed to both of those in 

1471
01:08:40,191 --> 01:08:42,170
the way you formulate that question 
because you said,

1472
01:08:42,171 --> 01:08:43,004
look,
well my mum was in the hospital and she 

1473
01:08:45,021 --> 01:08:45,854
needed care and so,
and I found a surgeon who was an 

1474
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:50,170
excellent surgeon.
And so,

1475
01:08:50,171 --> 01:08:53,540
so what you did there basically was take
a bow to the,

1476
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:58,670
you bowed before the functional 
hierarchy of the hospital and said,

1477
01:08:58,671 --> 01:08:59,504
look,
the greatest surgeon actually rose to 

1478
01:09:00,501 --> 01:09:03,230
the top and thank God for that because 
otherwise my mother would be dead.

1479
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:04,243
It's like,
yes,

1480
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:08,660
that's our competency hierarchy.
And it could be contaminated by tyranny,

1481
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:09,494
in which case it would be the brother of
some powerful person who ended up with 

1482
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:14,060
the surgical position.
Right.

1483
01:09:14,061 --> 01:09:16,460
And then everyone dies.
And that does happen in many,

1484
01:09:16,461 --> 01:09:17,294
many cultures where nepotism or 
connections define your position on 

1485
01:09:20,571 --> 01:09:22,550
every oxys.
But then you said,

1486
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:24,620
well,
but I went out to the hospital and I was

1487
01:09:24,621 --> 01:09:25,454
driving down the road and I saw what 
appeared to be a misallocation of 

1488
01:09:28,341 --> 01:09:29,174
resources.
And what we have to do about that is 

1489
01:09:30,711 --> 01:09:32,660
have it,
have a discussion about it constantly.

1490
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,713
It's like,
are we allocating resources to the 

1491
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:37,400
appropriate place?
Now the,

1492
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:38,413
the other lurking problem there is to 
what degree do we decide about the 

1493
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:48,380
allocation of resources by voluntary 
effort,

1494
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:49,550
by,
by planning,

1495
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:52,250
and to what degree do we let the market 
take care of it.

1496
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,280
And that's also something that 
continually requires negotiation.

1497
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:56,580
Mom's kate might,
well,

1498
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:58,790
I don't trust that.
Well that's the,

1499
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:00,740
that's the question is able to talk 
about it.

1500
01:10:00,741 --> 01:10:01,574
Like it's a neutral thing,
but it's just a conglomeration of 

1501
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:06,260
interests of the powerful,
well,

1502
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:06,801
it's,
it's,

1503
01:10:06,801 --> 01:10:09,530
it's a bunch of things.
I mean it's that it can be that,

1504
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:12,800
but it can also be the way that we 
collectively value things.

1505
01:10:12,801 --> 01:10:13,920
Like,
let me give you an example.

1506
01:10:13,921 --> 01:10:14,070
Okay.

1507
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:15,940
Look at our collective values and I'll 
just quickly say this.

1508
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,970
Yeah,
I heard this thing in Sweden.

1509
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:18,923
They,
uh,

1510
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:23,040
conduct regulate and control access to 
alcohol at a state level,

1511
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:26,870
like off licenses or liquor stores.
There's sort of socially run and like,

1512
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,820
and they're not allowed to be advertised
in Sweden's,

1513
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,461
you know,
Sweden,

1514
01:10:29,461 --> 01:10:32,340
I guess he's one of those havens of what
you might go,

1515
01:10:32,341 --> 01:10:33,174
I don't know what your views are.
Sweden by see a lot of stories about 

1516
01:10:34,621 --> 01:10:35,251
Sweden.
The same,

1517
01:10:35,251 --> 01:10:37,350
a bit like a,
Hey,

1518
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,393
we swayed and comes across as this,
I guess I sort of this sort of 

1519
01:10:40,381 --> 01:10:43,530
postmodern democracy or in some respects
anyhow,

1520
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:44,680
uh,
like I,

1521
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:45,533
I thought it was curious that they 
control alcohol in that manner and I am 

1522
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:51,570
envisaged that sort of breweries and 
liquor distributors would say,

1523
01:10:51,571 --> 01:10:52,980
Hey,
that's not free market.

1524
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:55,260
You're controlling access to,
you know,

1525
01:10:55,290 --> 01:11:00,290
people's access to alcohol as if somehow
the free market was neutral,

1526
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:04,550
but they ease no neutral.
If the market is what has the power,

1527
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:07,110
people's desires will be overly 
stimulated.

1528
01:11:07,111 --> 01:11:10,770
People if people like,
if people have McDonald's advertise that

1529
01:11:10,771 --> 01:11:13,200
they're more alcohol,
advertise at them people,

1530
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:14,340
Mcdonald's

1531
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,173
and alcohol,
there has to be some more realizing 

1532
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,793
force.
There has to be something that's not 

1533
01:11:19,021 --> 01:11:19,854
economically led.
There's not the manifestation of greed 

1534
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:27,660
that's in the conversation.
Someone in a secular society where there

1535
01:11:27,691 --> 01:11:28,524
is no reasonable or trusted voice of God
has to be able to say don't drink too 

1536
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:36,570
much alcohol.
Too Much Mcdonald's cause people will.

1537
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,260
Okay.
So,

1538
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,670
so let's see.
I think,

1539
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:39,923
I think the most effective solution to 
that problem is to have the economic 

1540
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:49,710
system run,
let's say by distributed individuals who

1541
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:53,550
are themselves aiming at a higher good.
So I think the way that you,

1542
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:56,340
the most effective way of regulating the
market so to speak,

1543
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:57,503
is to improve the moral character of the
people who make up the market rather 

1544
01:12:00,331 --> 01:12:01,164
than directly regulating the market.
And not that the market doesn't 

1545
01:12:04,771 --> 01:12:07,680
necessarily need some regulation because
you might say,

1546
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:08,514
well how about we don't devote alcohol 
advertising to children under 10 most 

1547
01:12:12,751 --> 01:12:15,120
people would agree that that's a 
reasonable perspective.

1548
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,190
And so that is limitation on market 
forces.

1549
01:12:17,191 --> 01:12:19,110
And there are places that you can find 
that,

1550
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:20,263
um,
that that limitation being accepted by 

1551
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:23,970
almost anyone.
But,

1552
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,013
but the part of what you're pointing to 
is that if the only thing that's 

1553
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:30,264
governing the market is concerned for 
pure market success than the market can 

1554
01:12:33,841 --> 01:12:36,720
produce all sorts of excesses.
But I think what you want,

1555
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:38,123
you want,
what you want is to help orient people 

1556
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:43,770
towards a transcendent good.
That's,

1557
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:47,010
oh,
that's over and above market interest.

1558
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:48,300
So you might say,
well,

1559
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:49,283
what interests should you serve as 
you're trying to be successful as a 

1560
01:12:51,091 --> 01:12:51,924
comedian or in while you're trying to 
make a living as a comedian say you 

1561
01:12:54,781 --> 01:12:57,780
might want to make sure that you're 
conducting yourself appropriately in the

1562
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,910
marketplace.
You're concerned about yourself,

1563
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:02,820
but also your future selves because you 
have to take,

1564
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,890
and that's partly why addiction is such 
a catastrophe,

1565
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:05,100
right?

1566
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:05,933
Because it's great in the short term,
but it's not so good in the medium to 

1567
01:13:08,131 --> 01:13:08,964
long run.
So you have to take care of yourself 

1568
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,000
and,
and your,

1569
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:12,893
your iterations through the future.
You have to take care of yourself in a 

1570
01:13:15,301 --> 01:13:16,890
way that you're taking care of your 
family.

1571
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,143
You have to take care of yourself and 
your family in a way that you're 

1572
01:13:19,921 --> 01:13:23,100
benefiting the community and that should
be foremost in your mind.

1573
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:25,470
So then when you start to make economic 
decisions,

1574
01:13:25,471 --> 01:13:27,570
even in your business,
you're not saying,

1575
01:13:27,571 --> 01:13:30,180
well I'm going to do whatever I can to 
make as much money as I can.

1576
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:31,343
You're going to say I'm going to do 
whatever I can to make as much money as 

1577
01:13:33,991 --> 01:13:38,820
I can while also making sure that I'm 
taking care of myself and my future self

1578
01:13:38,821 --> 01:13:42,210
and my family and my community and being
like Grat,

1579
01:13:42,211 --> 01:13:45,180
grateful for all of that and serving it 
properly.

1580
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:49,500
And then I think the market can work 
more effectively but still might require

1581
01:13:49,501 --> 01:13:51,930
some,
some discussion around the edges because

1582
01:13:51,931 --> 01:13:52,764
you know nothing is simple.
So the re the reason that I'm 

1583
01:13:55,111 --> 01:13:55,944
concentrating on the individual and 
individual development is because I 

1584
01:13:58,621 --> 01:14:00,930
think that's the best way to do that 
regulation.

1585
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:01,973
I think that's important.
I think it's non negotiable I think is 

1586
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:05,124
necessary by also believe that if you 
have a society this predicate it on the 

1587
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,190
some of the worst of human

1588
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,770
behavior.
I lost the desire fear.

1589
01:14:14,771 --> 01:14:18,040
If last fear and desire are so high in 
the mix,

1590
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:22,930
if you're continually being prompted 
towards onanism and consuming,

1591
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:26,980
I think it's that individual improvement
will be insufficient.

1592
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:32,090
I re I feel that your success is,
but I don't know it was based on,

1593
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:34,900
but I feel that to a degree you've 
contacted people and oh yeah,

1594
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:35,734
I can improve my own life.
I can have a bit of personal authority 

1595
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:39,640
and autonomy and I think that's hugely 
positive.

1596
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:42,100
But if every time you step out of your 
house,

1597
01:14:42,101 --> 01:14:44,410
every,
if every time you interface with society

1598
01:14:44,411 --> 01:14:46,240
or pick up your phone or look at a 
screen,

1599
01:14:46,241 --> 01:14:48,490
the aspect of yourself as being 
nurtured,

1600
01:14:48,491 --> 01:14:52,900
that's being invited to participate are 
the lower aspects of your nature because

1601
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:57,901
those are the most successful routes to 
a person's decision making impulses.

1602
01:14:58,170 --> 01:14:59,770
And I think that it's difficult to 
exceed.

1603
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:04,120
I think it's difficult for these 
individual projects to x to succeed.

1604
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:05,340
I think that your,
you know,

1605
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:08,020
certain people will,
that that message will take hold,

1606
01:15:08,021 --> 01:15:11,200
but others it won't.
So on to some degree we,

1607
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:15,730
I feel like I ain't like a big fan of 
regulation.

1608
01:15:15,731 --> 01:15:16,564
I understand your irritation about 
what's being like this sort of a post 

1609
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:21,843
modern deconstruction list argument of 
that destroy God that's destroy all 

1610
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,580
categories,
man.

1611
01:15:27,581 --> 01:15:28,780
Woman,
none of it's real.

1612
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:32,770
I believe in essence the humours the day
or tease the gods.

1613
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:33,783
I feel these things are present,
but I feel that we are already being 

1614
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:37,504
subject to a kind of invisible tyranny,
but it's already happening and I don't 

1615
01:15:40,811 --> 01:15:41,644
think it's happening as a result of like
some critical theory postmarks just 

1616
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,121
like,
I feel like that,

1617
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:49,420
that's not where power is.
That feels like it's sort of,

1618
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:52,750
it doesn't feel like it's just fucking 
powerful.

1619
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:55,330
Was Glaxo Klein or like,
you know,

1620
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:59,180
it's not as powerful as a Halliburton or
like,

1621
01:15:59,181 --> 01:15:59,890
you know,
these,

1622
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:02,380
that's what I'm interested in.
Did his power,

1623
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:06,880
real power and how power is functioning 
and how power is the,

1624
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:09,790
uh,
negatively impacting ordinary people?

1625
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,833
Well,
I think it's perfectly reasonable to 

1626
01:16:12,581 --> 01:16:13,414
point out that there might be multiple 
ways that people experience tyrannical 

1627
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:22,390
oppression now because every hierarchy 
is going to tilt towards tyrannical form

1628
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:23,224
in its own particular way.
And so I've been concerned about what's 

1629
01:16:25,571 --> 01:16:28,990
happening in the university on the 
radical left and your concern,

1630
01:16:28,991 --> 01:16:30,820
the concern that you just brought up is 
something like,

1631
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:31,953
um,
overwhelming large scale corporate 

1632
01:16:35,111 --> 01:16:38,050
dominance.
And I think that's also a reasonable set

1633
01:16:38,051 --> 01:16:39,370
of concerns.
You know,

1634
01:16:39,371 --> 01:16:41,590
it might not be for the best,
for example,

1635
01:16:41,591 --> 01:16:44,770
that all of our communication is 
filtered through google.

1636
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:47,810
That might be a bit too much.
Um,

1637
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:51,190
the question is,
the question always is,

1638
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:53,200
is what we can do about it.
And I think the answer,

1639
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:54,940
the answer is an answer to that 
actually.

1640
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:56,463
The answer is we can lead people's 
ability to communicate untrammeled and 

1641
01:17:01,091 --> 01:17:03,070
so that's why I'm an advocate of free 
speech.

1642
01:17:03,071 --> 01:17:03,904
We can lead people's ability to 
communicate untrammeled so that we can 

1643
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:09,950
have intelligent discussions about those
problems as they emerge

1644
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,843
and hopefully work towards solutions 
because we can't just generate a 

1645
01:17:13,401 --> 01:17:14,234
structure of rules that says,
well here's the 10 rules that are going 

1646
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:17,714
to deal without complex situation 
because things change too rapidly for 

1647
01:17:20,391 --> 01:17:23,420
that.
And the reason that freedom of speech as

1648
01:17:23,421 --> 01:17:25,700
far as I'm concerned is the paramount 
freedom,

1649
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:26,660
the paramount,
right.

1650
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:31,250
Also the paramount moral obligation is 
because it's through the,

1651
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:33,460
it's through our ability to exchange,
to,

1652
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:35,050
to,
to um,

1653
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,433
to exchange honest opinions that we 
participate in the process that enables 

1654
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:41,834
us to keep tyranny of the sort that you 
described and the sort that I described 

1655
01:17:44,691 --> 01:17:45,524
out bay.
And so part of the reason that I've 

1656
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,430
taken the tack I have politically is 
because,

1657
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:50,293
well my government had the gall to 
implement compelled speech legislation 

1658
01:17:54,621 --> 01:17:57,140
without noticing what it was that they 
were interfering with.

1659
01:17:57,650 --> 01:17:59,870
Cause you might say,
well well that's,

1660
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:03,260
that's pretty much the end of it.
How do you keep tyranny at bay free?

1661
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,500
The Ex,
the the proper exchange of ideas between

1662
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:09,740
free individuals keeps tyranny at bay.
That's the best we've got.

1663
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:10,783
It doesn't work perfectly.
It's also I think a gift that England 

1664
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,054
and in in large part has given to the 
rest of the world to formalize and 

1665
01:18:17,181 --> 01:18:18,014
codify that to put it into a body of law
to a wreck governmental structures that 

1666
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:21,914
are really predicated on that idea.
It's a remarkable achievement and it's 

1667
01:18:25,071 --> 01:18:27,110
something we should be profoundly 
grateful for.

1668
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:28,383
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about the taking 

1669
01:18:29,951 --> 01:18:30,784
that accepting praise on the behalf of 
England there as an English person I 

1670
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:40,040
accept that there are two dragons.
Then there is the inner and the at least

1671
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:44,560
unless until we've reached some 
non-dualistic utopia where everything is

1672
01:18:44,561 --> 01:18:45,394
one.
There is the inner tracking of our own 

1673
01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:48,874
desires and fears,
but I suppose like when we're talking 

1674
01:18:51,941 --> 01:18:52,774
about management of resources,
is that a phrase that we could give the 

1675
01:18:55,181 --> 01:18:57,610
came up earlier?
Like the where,

1676
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,090
where does the attention need to go and 
it's difficult.

1677
01:19:01,091 --> 01:19:01,924
Like you know me,
I suppose there's something about my 

1678
01:19:02,891 --> 01:19:06,520
background that has led me to identify 
as the Dragon.

1679
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:07,383
Oh it's consumerism is turning people 
into consumers because obviously as an 

1680
01:19:09,671 --> 01:19:12,970
addict that's what I am,
a consumer and roll truck and Schumer.

1681
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,910
And it seems that you,
with your background in academia,

1682
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:16,800
this,
the,

1683
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,680
the,
this a neo Marxist post because,

1684
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:23,710
but when I sort of like think about 
aspects of socialism,

1685
01:19:23,711 --> 01:19:24,820
Eg,
you know,

1686
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,020
people are working too hard.

1687
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:26,853
You should only work four hours a day.
They should be time for fishing in the 

1688
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:31,620
afternoon,
which I think is in Das kapital.

1689
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:32,533
Vicky talks about fishing in the 
afternoon and for me that seems like a 

1690
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:39,871
very beautiful and fair and just idea.
Also I don't see them like wow,

1691
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:46,180
I can imagine that they're irritating on
a campus,

1692
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:50,140
particularly for somebody who's research
such a lot.

1693
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:54,700
I don't see them as powerful.
That's my,

1694
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:59,620
that's part of my intrigue I suppose.
It's comparable to when I was talking to

1695
01:19:59,621 --> 01:20:01,860
Sam Harris and other post do I have maya
but whom I go,

1696
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:03,070
oh yeah,
but I don't like,

1697
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,904
you know,
like when I'm talking to Sam Harris 

1698
01:20:04,961 --> 01:20:06,520
about Islam,
I'll go be a,

1699
01:20:06,521 --> 01:20:08,010
but when like where's how

1700
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:10,740
is Islam at gonna be like,
like I feel like it,

1701
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:11,733
even if he's aware of Saudi Arabia and 
Wahhabism like Saudi Arabia as an 

1702
01:20:14,821 --> 01:20:15,654
economic entity,
they're not an Islamic entity in terms 

1703
01:20:18,301 --> 01:20:19,770
of race,
go do some Islam.

1704
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,620
It's like let's go do some business know
and like,

1705
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:25,860
and so I suppose here what my,
my,

1706
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:31,280
well I'm concerned mostly I'm concerned 
mostly with the emphasis on,

1707
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:34,830
on the collective identity rather than 
the individual identity.

1708
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:37,380
Like the process that you just 
described,

1709
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,633
I would say,
and this is the answer to the question 

1710
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:41,334
that you posed at the beginning of our 
conversation is is there something 

1711
01:20:43,261 --> 01:20:45,330
universal about the process that you 
laid out?

1712
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:46,583
And I think there is,
and I think it's at the core of 

1713
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:52,590
individual development and I think it's 
the most powerful of forces.

1714
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:53,783
And so I think that the individual 
should be regarded as the proper locus 

1715
01:20:56,431 --> 01:20:57,330
of evaluation.

1716
01:20:57,390 --> 01:21:00,690
And the problem I have with the 
postmodern neo marxists types apart from

1717
01:21:00,691 --> 01:21:01,524
the fact that there were analysis tends 
to lead to a kind of nihilism is that 

1718
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:08,700
because they're making the group the 
paramount level of analysis,

1719
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:11,310
this sort of thing gets ignored.
And I,

1720
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,173
what I'm trying to do in my work,
we have a program called the self 

1721
01:21:14,941 --> 01:21:15,774
authoring program that kind of steps 
people through these 12 steps that you 

1722
01:21:18,391 --> 01:21:19,224
just described.
First thing that people do is write 

1723
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:23,220
about their past all the emotional 
experiences.

1724
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:26,460
The second thing they do is take an 
inventory of their personality,

1725
01:21:26,461 --> 01:21:27,294
faults and virtues so that they can 
rectify the faults and capitalized on 

1726
01:21:30,361 --> 01:21:31,194
the virtues.
And the third thing they do is chart a 

1727
01:21:33,271 --> 01:21:37,140
course for the future that takes them 
into account and others.

1728
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:38,423
And so,
and I see it as a reflection of this 

1729
01:21:40,261 --> 01:21:41,094
universal process that you just 
described and I think it's the most 

1730
01:21:43,831 --> 01:21:46,260
powerful form of transformation.

1731
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,393
But more importantly,
I also think it's the one that risks 

1732
01:21:49,681 --> 01:21:53,010
doing the least harm.
Like it hasn't heard anybody that you've

1733
01:21:53,011 --> 01:21:55,650
put yourself together.
It's just good,

1734
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:57,090
right?
It's good for you.

1735
01:21:57,091 --> 01:21:59,850
It's good for the people that know you.
There's nothing about it.

1736
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,670
And it's,
it's the right level of humility because

1737
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:07,380
you took what you knew to be wrong in 
your experience.

1738
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:11,850
You took personal responsibility for it.
You made changes for yourself.

1739
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:12,893
You didn't go around pointing the finger
at what was wrong with the external 

1740
01:22:15,211 --> 01:22:17,760
world and trying to fix it.
Now look,

1741
01:22:17,761 --> 01:22:20,820
it could easily be that once you have 
your act together,

1742
01:22:20,821 --> 01:22:21,654
or maybe even before,
you should be doing some things to 

1743
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,090
adjust political systems or sociological
systems.

1744
01:22:27,091 --> 01:22:30,780
But the problem with that is what makes 
you think you can trust yourself?

1745
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:32,401
You know?
And it's like,

1746
01:22:32,401 --> 01:22:33,390
well,
I'm compassionate.

1747
01:22:33,391 --> 01:22:34,224
It's like maybe,
maybe you're also envious of the 

1748
01:22:35,761 --> 01:22:39,000
successful and the probability of that's
pretty damn high,

1749
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:39,834
by the way.

1750
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:43,200
And so you better know before you 
express that compassion,

1751
01:22:43,201 --> 01:22:44,034
especially in the political domain,
whether or not that is contaminated by 

1752
01:22:46,771 --> 01:22:48,960
things about yourself that you haven't 
contended with.

1753
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:52,000
Do you think an on declaration,
uh,

1754
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:52,853
along those lines or specifically that 
in the political field would be 

1755
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:57,690
refreshing?
Look,

1756
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,820
I'll tell you one of the,
this is a very funny thing.

1757
01:22:59,821 --> 01:23:03,300
So the ancient,
the emperor of Ancient Mesopotamia.

1758
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:05,980
So this is some of the earliest 
political we have,

1759
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:06,814
by the way.
Here's what they used to do to the 

1760
01:23:07,811 --> 01:23:09,970
emperor.
Every new year's Day,

1761
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:12,520
they would take him outside the walls of
the city.

1762
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:15,580
So he was responsible for everything 
within the walls.

1763
01:23:15,581 --> 01:23:19,000
Outside was chaos and the unknown,
they'd take them outside the city,

1764
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:21,520
they'd strip him of all his emperor 
garb.

1765
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:24,220
So he's no longer emperor.
They'd make him kneel,

1766
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:25,930
they'd humiliate him.
I think the,

1767
01:23:25,931 --> 01:23:26,764
if I remember correctly,
the priest would hit him with a glove 

1768
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:29,740
and say,
okay,

1769
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:31,143
in the last year,
how name all the ways that you didn't 

1770
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:38,710
embody Marduk Marduk was the god of the 
Mesopotamians.

1771
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:41,920
And Marduk was the thing that took on 
the great dragon of chaos.

1772
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:45,200
And so it was the,
it was the responsibility of the emperor

1773
01:23:45,201 --> 01:23:47,110
to,
is to kneel down and say,

1774
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,033
here's all the ways that I haven't been 
acting out my proper self and had 

1775
01:23:51,881 --> 01:23:55,240
brought the kingdom into disarray and 
then he would be forgiven.

1776
01:23:55,241 --> 01:23:57,640
They would act out the reconstruction of
the cosmos.

1777
01:23:57,641 --> 01:24:01,090
That was the New Year's celebration.
And then he'd go in and try to be a good

1778
01:24:01,091 --> 01:24:02,010
king.
I like,

1779
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:02,560
so,
yeah.

1780
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,460
Yeah,
no kidding.

1781
01:24:03,461 --> 01:24:04,294
Absolutely.
It's like the confession of the emperor 

1782
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,660
is,
here's the way I haven't been good

1783
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,660
and at any comparable,
uh,

1784
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:14,200
and the powerful held up to that kind of
evaluation in,

1785
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,690
we don't have rituals for that.
Well,

1786
01:24:16,691 --> 01:24:19,630
I suppose we don't acknowledge the 
emergence of order from chaos.

1787
01:24:19,631 --> 01:24:20,380
We don't,
uh,

1788
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:23,500
a merge [inaudible] knowledge,
divine principles.

1789
01:24:23,501 --> 01:24:24,334
So the powerful and light,
and I think this is possibly because of 

1790
01:24:26,111 --> 01:24:28,300
a assumed meritocracy,
but I mean,

1791
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,160
people that are in positions of power,
they're there for a reason.

1792
01:24:30,161 --> 01:24:30,994
You don't need to start stripping him 
naked and take them outside of the city 

1793
01:24:32,621 --> 01:24:33,454
and saying,
how often did you rank in that Oval 

1794
01:24:34,301 --> 01:24:37,000
Office?
Every day get out.

1795
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,210
Yeah,
well I think there might be something to

1796
01:24:40,211 --> 01:24:42,100
that.
And that's the danger of pride that goes

1797
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:43,960
along with ascension in a hierarchy.
Well,

1798
01:24:43,961 --> 01:24:46,210
because I'm here in this position,
I must deserve it.

1799
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:46,931
It's like,
yeah,

1800
01:24:46,931 --> 01:24:49,780
but there should still be something that
you're bowing down to.

1801
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:53,470
And that might be the abstract idea of 
sovereign authority itself.

1802
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:55,420
If you think about it only 
psychologically,

1803
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:56,403
that's a figure that essentially has a 
touch of divinity about it because it's 

1804
01:25:00,911 --> 01:25:04,330
the on a key right now harm.
So that's the Queen,

1805
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,750
the anointed and appointed monitor.
She represents,

1806
01:25:07,751 --> 01:25:09,670
you know,
by I suppose in a post secular nation,

1807
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:14,440
she becomes the emblem of Britain rondon
the emblem of God on,

1808
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:15,191
well,
I think,

1809
01:25:15,191 --> 01:25:17,930
I think it actually functions to some 
degree in the same line.

1810
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:18,823
Well,
I do think so because the queen your 

1811
01:25:20,141 --> 01:25:23,050
queen in particular our queen as well 
because maybe an alien.

1812
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:26,270
No,
I mean I think Alyssa has been,

1813
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,233
uh,
uh,

1814
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:29,540
uh,
an embodiment of moral virtue.

1815
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:30,613
I mean,
she's done a remarkable job over the 

1816
01:25:31,611 --> 01:25:32,301
last,
what is it,

1817
01:25:32,301 --> 01:25:35,390
75 years now.
She's held herself to an incredibly high

1818
01:25:35,391 --> 01:25:36,224
moral standard.
And I think she does sit in the 

1819
01:25:37,431 --> 01:25:39,680
background as emblematic of what

1820
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:43,590
sovereign authority might look like.
Of course you postmodernist.

1821
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:44,780
And this is an area where,
cause I,

1822
01:25:44,781 --> 01:25:45,614
you know,
I'm English and I can't get away from 

1823
01:25:46,491 --> 01:25:47,324
the love of the Queen,
but I would also say that she is an 

1824
01:25:49,431 --> 01:25:54,431
emblem of authority and of power and of 
wealth and land ownership.

1825
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:55,753
And that there is,
that there is an order that ought be 

1826
01:25:58,431 --> 01:25:59,264
respected and can't be challenged every 
so often this country sort of toys with 

1827
01:26:02,421 --> 01:26:04,010
the idea of they're always

1828
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,350
grateful when there's a wedding,
right?

1829
01:26:05,351 --> 01:26:07,370
Maybe he's this week so that no one has 
to think,

1830
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:08,383
is this right?
What are we paying for this bizarre 

1831
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,350
spectacle.
But it,

1832
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:15,140
but it is useful to think about it in a 
symbolic sense.

1833
01:26:15,141 --> 01:26:15,974
I mean,
one of the things that constantly 

1834
01:26:16,731 --> 01:26:19,880
threatens the United States,
I think there should be four branches of

1835
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:21,740
government,
legislative,

1836
01:26:21,741 --> 01:26:24,710
judicial,
executive,

1837
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:28,070
and symbolic.
Because the problem in the United States

1838
01:26:28,071 --> 01:26:30,410
is the president keeps tilting towards 
king,

1839
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:32,750
you know,
the Americans like the idea of the first

1840
01:26:32,751 --> 01:26:34,670
family and the first lady.
And it's like,

1841
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:36,620
yeah,
no,

1842
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,260
and,
and,

1843
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,560
and,
and kind of tilts towards a dynasty.

1844
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:42,560
And you've seen that happen with the 
bushes and the Clintons and it's not,

1845
01:26:42,561 --> 01:26:44,000
it's,
it's not a good thing.

1846
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:48,410
And it might be nice to have someone 
take the symbolic load off the president

1847
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:49,244
and just act that out.
And your queen does that very nicely 

1848
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:52,423
because all of the pomp and circumstance
of the state and all the drama and 

1849
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:59,210
ritual of the sovereign can be played 
out in that sort of dramatic space.

1850
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:00,133
And your legislature and executive 
branches can go off and do the 

1851
01:27:02,481 --> 01:27:04,460
administration.
It's interesting that the,

1852
01:27:04,461 --> 01:27:05,140
uh,
the,

1853
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:05,973
the,
the dentist's ds exert themselves in a 

1854
01:27:08,601 --> 01:27:09,434
sense.
It's a demonstration of your argument 

1855
01:27:11,361 --> 01:27:12,194
that there are certain hierarchal 
systems that find their way into 

1856
01:27:13,941 --> 01:27:14,774
fruition regardless of regulation.
But then I suppose there's rational 

1857
01:27:17,481 --> 01:27:19,940
reasons they would have the resources,
the experiences that can,

1858
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:20,803
the connections.
Sure.

1859
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:23,510
It's easier for them.
But that's also the d that's a danger to

1860
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:24,344
a republic is the fact that,
and it's part of the potential 

1861
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:27,374
corruption of the state,
is that while it's easier for the 

1862
01:27:29,931 --> 01:27:33,080
children of those who have authority to 
have power,

1863
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:34,543
and you don't want people attaining the 
pinnacle of achievement because of 

1864
01:27:37,281 --> 01:27:38,114
power,
he want them attending the pinnacle of 

1865
01:27:39,501 --> 01:27:41,640
achievement because of competence.
Yeah.

1866
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:42,260
Yeah.
And,

1867
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:44,240
and those things always struggle.
They all,

1868
01:27:44,241 --> 01:27:44,721
and,
and it,

1869
01:27:44,721 --> 01:27:45,554
it,
it takes a society that's very awake to 

1870
01:27:47,661 --> 01:27:48,494
stop the hierarchies from degenerating 
into hierarchies of power because the 

1871
01:27:51,771 --> 01:27:53,440
generation is the tendency.

1872
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:54,710
Sure.
While it's easy,

1873
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:59,600
it's easy.
Wba that fearsome and terrifying.

1874
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:00,500
Uh,
you know,

1875
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:05,030
faulconer pallium well,
and people have recognized that it's the

1876
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:08,960
proclivity of hierarchies to,
towards tyranny for,

1877
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:10,550
for really,
for thousands of years.

1878
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:14,660
And I've seen that as a fundamental 
danger to proper adaptation.

1879
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:16,550
We need hierarchies.
Yes.

1880
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:19,940
But they degenerate into tyranny and 
they unfairly,

1881
01:28:19,941 --> 01:28:20,630
oh,
press.

1882
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:21,463
It's like,
yes,

1883
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,633
we have to be on guard against that.
But that doesn't mean that we call all 

1884
01:28:25,191 --> 01:28:28,010
hierarchies tyrannies cause that's not 
helpful.

1885
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,730
Or we call all productive activity 
service in the,

1886
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:32,593
in the service to the oppressive 
patriarchy because that's seriously not 

1887
01:28:36,531 --> 01:28:37,364
how helpful and we don't dispense with 
hierarchies because then people don't 

1888
01:28:39,951 --> 01:28:42,140
have anything to do.
So yes.

1889
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:43,093
So I see,
I get the beam out your iheart like so 

1890
01:28:44,781 --> 01:28:48,760
say if the individual is tuned,
if the individual is at channel,

1891
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:52,200
I'm going to to,
I like the prayer of Saint Francis.

1892
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:57,700
I like it as a model.
They invites us to find the reverse of h

1893
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:00,273
a defective characteristic that we all 
sin that we might be living out to 

1894
01:29:05,371 --> 01:29:07,770
become a channel of some inherent 
goodness.

1895
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:10,443
The thing that's one of the things 
that's interesting rolled out or two 

1896
01:29:12,391 --> 01:29:13,224
things actually.
The first is the word sin means to miss 

1897
01:29:15,631 --> 01:29:17,160
the target.
It's an archery term.

1898
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:18,413
So that's quite,
that's a very interesting way of 

1899
01:29:19,651 --> 01:29:21,830
thinking about it because it means that 
there is a target,

1900
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:23,670
there is a target.
That's the thing.

1901
01:29:23,671 --> 01:29:25,190
But the next thing is,
and this,

1902
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:26,213
this comes right out of that,
is it's very useful to become aware of 

1903
01:29:28,741 --> 01:29:32,010
your faults because as soon as you pause
it a fault,

1904
01:29:32,011 --> 01:29:34,680
you pause it the opposite by merely 
saying,

1905
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:35,550
well,
that's a fault.

1906
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:36,413
You're saying implicitly,
while there's something that's the 

1907
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:40,530
opposite of that,
so out of your recognition of faults,

1908
01:29:40,531 --> 01:29:44,460
immediately some clarity of virtue 
develops because you might say,

1909
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:46,470
well,
this is a fault and I really know it.

1910
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:47,101
It's like,
great,

1911
01:29:47,101 --> 01:29:50,910
you've got some bedrock there.
Whatever the opposite of that fault is,

1912
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:51,923
you might not know what that is,
but whatever the opposite of that fault 

1913
01:29:54,241 --> 01:29:55,410
is,
is a virtue.

1914
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:56,820
And then you might say,
well,

1915
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:58,860
I have 20 faults.
It's like great.

1916
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:04,160
The opposite of the personality that has
all those 20 faults is the virtuous you,

1917
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:06,180
whatever that might happen to be.
Well,

1918
01:30:06,181 --> 01:30:07,014
great.
Then you've then you've conjured out of 

1919
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,530
the devil,
um,

1920
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,740
ah,
a redeemer.

1921
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:12,780
It's something like that.
I like that.

1922
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:18,260
And the UN doubtedly both in terms of 
cosmology and fleeting morality,

1923
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:24,090
there is chaos,
there is vastness,

1924
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:25,133
but there are also patterns.
There are patterns that emerge and 

1925
01:30:27,871 --> 01:30:32,460
whether you call that pattern male or 
love or beauty,

1926
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:35,500
there are various patterns and I feel 
that there is,

1927
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,710
there is something to get in alignment 
with.

1928
01:30:37,711 --> 01:30:39,960
There is a choon,
there is harmony,

1929
01:30:39,961 --> 01:30:41,910
there is melody,
there is grace.

1930
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:46,500
We're not totally rested.
All you're using their musical musical,

1931
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:47,334
uh,
um,

1932
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:49,860
what would you call analogies are 
meaningful representations.

1933
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:50,783
That's what music expresses is to have 
all of that in harmony because people 

1934
01:30:53,851 --> 01:30:55,950
love music because of that,
you know,

1935
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:58,410
in those patterns because music,
you think about music,

1936
01:30:58,411 --> 01:30:59,244
it is the harmonious interaction of 
patterns and you just described all 

1937
01:31:02,230 --> 01:31:04,400
those positive,
uh,

1938
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:05,700
what would you call them?
Spirits.

1939
01:31:05,701 --> 01:31:07,980
That's a good way of thinking about it 
as patterns,

1940
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:08,933
while they are patterns.
And then you might think that there's a 

1941
01:31:10,321 --> 01:31:12,750
pattern that's composed of all of those 
patterns.

1942
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,020
Well that's what you're after.
You're after the pattern that's composed

1943
01:31:16,021 --> 01:31:17,730
of all those patterns.
Yes,

1944
01:31:17,731 --> 01:31:18,564
absolutely.
And you want to put yourself in harmony 

1945
01:31:19,561 --> 01:31:21,930
with that and that is a real thing.
That's a real thing.

1946
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:26,100
You can feel that.
So it's what keeps you alive essentially

1947
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,000
when you're trying to become conscious.
Yes,

1948
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:31,350
yes.
There is something important happening.

1949
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:32,483
I feel like what we were saying before 
about the acknowledgement of difference 

1950
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:37,133
need an infor inferiority.
That is something that definitely not 

1951
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:43,190
while we should be actually,
well,

1952
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:47,250
and this is part of what the radical 
leftists keeps saying is,

1953
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:49,020
well,
we should celebrate diversity.

1954
01:31:49,021 --> 01:31:50,130
It's like,
yes,

1955
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:54,380
but what that means first is the 
admission that people actually differ.

1956
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:56,010
You know,
always you don't have diversity.

1957
01:31:56,190 --> 01:31:58,140
It's like,
I'm glad there are conservatives.

1958
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,040
I'm glad there are leftists.

1959
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:04,240
The conservatives run things,
the leftists invent them.

1960
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:06,910
It's like good and they're really 
different.

1961
01:32:06,911 --> 01:32:08,590
Those people like you know,
if you,

1962
01:32:08,591 --> 01:32:11,260
if you have a group that's all 
conservatives and they're going down the

1963
01:32:11,261 --> 01:32:12,094
right path,
they're going to go down that path 

1964
01:32:13,031 --> 01:32:13,864
really fast,
but if they're going down the wrong 

1965
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:15,904
path,
they're not going to be able to think 

1966
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:18,430
laterally and figure out how to get out 
of it.

1967
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:21,670
If you have a group of of left leaning 
creative types,

1968
01:32:21,671 --> 01:32:23,860
it's like they're going to come up with 
a hundred ideas,

1969
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:25,143
but the probability that they'll 
organize in a stable hierarchy and 

1970
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:29,103
implement those effectively is zero.
It's they're going to have to call over 

1971
01:32:32,021 --> 01:32:33,040
the conservatives.
It's like,

1972
01:32:33,041 --> 01:32:35,230
look guys,
we finally got a good idea.

1973
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:36,333
You can have one idea cause you're 
conservatives run with it and then they 

1974
01:32:39,581 --> 01:32:40,414
can all run with it.
And so it's really good that we have 

1975
01:32:42,371 --> 01:32:43,204
people who are like that on both sides 
of the distribution because otherwise 

1976
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:47,333
the,
the creative types would sit around and 

1977
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:52,530
come up with new ideas until they starve
to death in squalor.

1978
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:56,490
And while exactly.
And the Conservatives would just awesome

1979
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,270
fi and,
and you know,

1980
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:01,300
run down a road that got narrower,
narrow,

1981
01:33:01,301 --> 01:33:02,134
narrow,
and they'd all end up stuck between two 

1982
01:33:03,221 --> 01:33:05,890
cliffs and that'd be the end of it for 
both of them.

1983
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,510
Thesis,
antithesis,

1984
01:33:07,511 --> 01:33:10,240
synthesis.
We require synthesis.

1985
01:33:10,241 --> 01:33:12,610
This is how does the interplay of 
opposites.

1986
01:33:12,611 --> 01:33:14,050
Actual opposites.
Yeah,

1987
01:33:14,051 --> 01:33:14,621
yeah,
yeah.

1988
01:33:14,621 --> 01:33:15,454
The Yin Yang that yes,
there needs to be necessary collusion 

1989
01:33:18,191 --> 01:33:20,140
between distinction,
but for that to happen,

1990
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:24,730
there needs to be acknowledgement and 
recognition of difference in a trying to

1991
01:33:24,731 --> 01:33:28,960
achieve a quality with the Annihilation 
of category is not successful.

1992
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,010
Yes.
That's that.

1993
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,230
That's exactly right.
That's exactly right.

1994
01:33:32,231 --> 01:33:36,160
That is not a successful route.
Thank you.

1995
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:38,830
Duck tapped.
Professor Jordan Peterson.

1996
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:41,350
We have good chats that way.
That was great.

1997
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:42,550
Yeah,
that was really good.

1998
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:45,180
Absolutely.
Thanks for inviting me back.

1999
01:33:45,610 --> 01:33:46,810
Thank you.
Thank you for the time.

2000
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:47,561
Thank you.
Thank you,

2001
01:33:47,561 --> 01:33:48,394
Tami.
Thank you.
