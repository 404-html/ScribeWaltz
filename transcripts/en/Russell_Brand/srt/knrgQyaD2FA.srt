1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,073
So your perspective and your motivation 
is an optimistic one that you 

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:09,240
essentially believe that people that 
have extremist beliefs,

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,150
however,
those beliefs are resourced,

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,993
whether it's a fundament fundamentalism 
from an Islamic perspective or ethno 

5
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:18,810
nationalism.
Yeah.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,853
You think that these are almost 
temporary few bugs that human beings 

7
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:23,994
passed through,
that they are not essential states as 

8
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:28,014
you said,
that you are interested in in meeting 

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,530
the human being behind the,
the,

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,360
the,
and you believe that human being is more

11
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:34,620
truthful,
more real,

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,230
better than their group identity.
And each of these cases

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,880
I do because what I've found in,
in doing all the films that I've done at

14
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:44,250
this point is the,
the whatever the,

15
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:49,220
the window do I always call it sort of 
window dressing or whatever the brand is

16
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,720
that might be different,
you know?

17
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:51,554
So on the surface of it,
it's going to look different to most 

18
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:58,520
people when it comes to a jihadi versus 
a neo Nazi.

19
00:00:58,521 --> 00:00:59,354
Well,
these are completely opposing 

20
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,483
ideologies,
completely different people and 

21
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:04,790
therefore should be treated completely 
differently.

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:05,983
But what I found is that the type of men
that are attracted to these movements 

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,263
and the type of vulnerabilities that 
those men possess that are being preyed 

24
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:15,404
upon by people in a position to misuse 
whatever vulnerabilities that these men 

25
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:23,640
have for their own political gains.
Um,

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,970
all the same,
the psychological,

27
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:29,720
the emotional,
the social makeup of the,

28
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:34,100
the guys across the spectrum.
I have found actually to be really,

29
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:35,750
really similar,
whether it's,

30
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:36,890
you know,
a matter of,

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,960
you know,
searching for meaning,

32
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:41,840
searching for belonging,
searching for a sense of purpose,

33
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:44,300
searching for a brotherhood,
camaraderie,

34
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,400
searching for just a way of coping with 
a very,

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,330
you know,
quickly changing world,

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,840
um,
finding themselves to be insignificant,

37
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,890
powerless.

38
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,770
Yeah.

39
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,603
And then you have recruiters and you 
have these movements that are filling 

40
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,540
those voids actively and cynically 
actually filling those voids,

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,120
not by accident,
but actually by design.

42
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,080
And I find that really troubling.
But I also find that quite hopeful.

43
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,313
Um,
because I think that these basic human 

44
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:19,430
needs,
I mean,

45
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,453
I am searching and have been searching 
for all of these things that I've just 

46
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:24,860
listed as well.
You know,

47
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:25,694
it's just,
it manifests itself different for me 

48
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,320
than it does for these guys.
And it's just for me,

49
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:33,710
it's a matter of figuring out how do we 
satisfy these,

50
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,753
these needs for young people?
How do we satisfy and address these 

51
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,100
vulnerabilities that that young people 
have?

52
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:40,934
And also how do we confront the feelings
of shame and humiliation and 

53
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:45,584
powerlessness that so many people feel 
before they become instrumentalized by 

54
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,410
our politicians and by populism.
So you found a group regardless of yeah.

55
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,670
How it superficially polarized the group
identities

56
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,670
of white supremacists or jihadist may 
seem that there's a kind of uniformity.

57
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,890
Absolutely.
So,

58
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,620
absolutely.
Because,

59
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:12,241
because the,
the,

60
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:14,980
these movements are meeting these young 
men,

61
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,360
predominantly men.
I mean,

62
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,190
obviously there are some women that 
that's important.

63
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,713
I do,
I think gender is a tremendous part of 

64
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:22,564
this.
I think,

65
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,523
I think a sense of masculinity or a 
sense of sort of toxic masculinity I 

66
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:30,490
think is absolutely,
absolutely essential to this,

67
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,610
to both movements or to any kind of 
extremist movement.

68
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,863
Um,
and I think that's also systematically 

69
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,390
overlooked.
I think the way that our media addresses

70
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:43,120
extremists,
and I think the way that all politicians

71
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,060
address extremism in,
in general,

72
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,043
I think is not very helpful.
They constantly want to make it 

73
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,624
something exotic,
something so impossible and monstrous 

74
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,480
because surely we can't do anything 
about this.

75
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:56,314
These people are just hideous.
They possess these hideous views and 

76
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:01,360
less just sign them all off.

77
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,493
And that's not the truth.
The truth is they're all operating out 

78
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:10,771
of really basic needs and those needs 
are not being met in their life,

79
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,250
in their immediate family life,
or in the wider society.

80
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,940
That says more about us as a society 
than it does about these men.

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,420
And so I'm interested in that.
I'm interested in,

82
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:22,254
in,
in finding an excavating what those 

83
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:26,440
needs are,
what those vulnerabilities are,

84
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,390
look extremists of any kind of stripe 
and,

85
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:32,050
and,
and,

86
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,920
um,
any form flourishes in,

87
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,020
um,
in vacuums,

88
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,610
right?
So you have Hamas and his wool line.

89
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,370
All these kind of,
you know,

90
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,120
big names that we've heard of.
They provide in,

91
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,350
in circumstances and environments where 
social services do not exist.

92
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,050
Education does not,
you know,

93
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,710
uh,
does not exist.

94
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,650
Uh,
uh,

95
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,660
healthcare does not exist.
They are filling those voids.

96
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,660
So whether it's political voids,
it is economic voice,

97
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:02,494
or it is social and emotional and 
psychological voids in the lives of 

98
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,080
people.
These extremist groups,

99
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:11,110
whatever their brand is,
are fulfilling those,

100
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,730
knowing what these lax and these voids 
are in people's lives.

101
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,460
So why do they know that while they 
doing that,

102
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,294
and we are not,
why is our political system not 

103
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,703
addressing the social and economic and 
the political grievances that our young 

104
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,820
people have?
Yes,

105
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:29,651
it does.
And again,

106
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:33,820
it doesn't excuse the way that they're 
choosing to express that.

107
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,743
I think we can say at the beginning that
no one's is seeking to excuse the 

108
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:38,520
behavior of extreme.

109
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,613
Yes.
