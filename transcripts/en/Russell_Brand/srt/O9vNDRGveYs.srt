00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
My guest on under the skin today is 
doctor Robin Carhart Harris,

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,480
the head of psychedelic research at 
Imperial College London,

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:10,703
and he's not even 37 years of age yet.
He's already been described as the whiz 

4
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:15,914
kid of psychedelic research and imagine 
how competitive that field is and the 

5
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:23,010
cooler,
the younger brother of Brian Cox,

6
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:23,844
who we are,
and they'll hopefully have only the 

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,050
university did a lovely thing,
isn't it?

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,730
His research is as exciting as it is 
taboo.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,643
He investigates the brain effects and 
potential therapeutic uses of 

10
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:34,554
psychedelic drugs and as such,
as the first person in the UK to have 

11
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:37,884
legally administered doses of Lsd to 
human volunteers since the misuse of 

12
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:46,040
drug act in 1971.
Dr.

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,360
Robin,
thank you for coming on the show.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,260
Pleasure.
Yeah.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,850
Nice to be here.
Thanks for inviting me.

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,260
Oh,
you're so kind to say,

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,410
can I call you doctor?
Sure.

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,270
Although I'm not a medical doctor is 
going to banks.

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,133
I don't think of any of that.
Anyone that's not a medical doctor I 

20
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:01,914
think should be stripped of that title,
unless you're wearing a white coat and 

21
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:08,610
putting your fingers up people's bomb.
I don't consider you part of our system.

22
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,570
Thanks Dr.
Robin.

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,570
I'm still have a sufficiently did wish 
to find titles at lowering doctors,

24
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:19,500
professors,
all of that stuff.

25
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:23,430
I'm buying into it and tell me,
can you tell me what that means that you

26
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:26,260
are the head of psychedelic research it

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,260
the empirical what,
what's going on for the last few years?

28
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:33,060
I suppose about,
uh,

29
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,013
eight years now.
I've been doing human research with 

30
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:38,830
psychedelic drugs.
Um,

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,683
I've done a number of brain imaging 
studies looking at how these drugs work 

32
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,760
in the brain.
Uh,

33
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:47,690
most recently I've transitioned into,
uh,

34
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,850
giving a psychedelic for a particular 
psychiatric disorder to try and treat it

35
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:57,450
as depression and we give psilocybin 
which is found in magic mushrooms.

36
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,653
Um,
so now the team is transitioning more 

37
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:05,550
into looking at applications and how 
these drugs can be useful,

38
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,990
not just how they work.

39
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,880
Yeah.
Presumably if you're moving to the point

40
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:12,030
of application,
some of the efficacy of these substances

41
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,190
have been established.
Now I'm ragging.

42
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:15,024
Before we get into that,
I'd like to learn how someone growing 

43
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:19,970
up,
you're a British person.

44
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,450
I how,
how,

45
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,340
how did you get into psychedelics?
Because there's,

46
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:27,060
it seems to me like a broad and 
interesting field.

47
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,590
Tell me about your academic

48
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,990
background and how you became interested
in.

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,513
Well,
let's kind of two aspects to the story 

50
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,580
and perhaps the latter one which is 
easier to talk about.

51
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,570
Happened around my early twenties when I
was studying psychoanalysis,

52
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,493
so freud and yoga and um,
and I was absolutely fascinated by this 

53
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:53,760
topic and I couldn't get enough of it 
and I was,

54
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,013
you know,
any opportunity reading whatever I 

55
00:02:56,731 --> 00:03:01,731
could.
But I also felt little dissatisfied with

56
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,880
where psychoanalysis sat in terms of 
mainstream psychology.

57
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,063
Um,
it felt Kinda clickish it felt that's 

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,793
not scientific enough.
It didn't seem to have convinced people 

59
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,413
of the validity of its main ideas,
like the existence of the unconscious 

60
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:21,880
mind,
for example.

61
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,133
And I was a believer in some sense,
but I didn't want it to have to be that 

62
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:30,280
way.
I didn't want it to have to be a kind of

63
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:31,150
leap of faith.

64
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,423
Um,
I thought we could maybe demonstrate 

65
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,440
that certain principles of 
psychoanalysis a true.

66
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,723
And by these principles you mean 
primarily the existence of an 

67
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,140
unconscious on an individual level,
yes,

68
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,520
but also a collective level.
So that would be called Young's work,

69
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:52,470
that there's aspects of our psyches that
are shared ena,

70
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,380
certain themes,
certain ways of being certain aspects of

71
00:03:56,381 --> 00:04:00,410
the human condition that are enough or,
and this is demonstrated what through me

72
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,340
motifs and archetype.
Yeah.

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,420
Yeah.
Why did you find that so interesting?

74
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,063
Well,
I think because it felt true because it 

75
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:12,190
resonated with me and I think you can 
see it in culture.

76
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,930
You can see it in religion.
Um,

77
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,000
and,
and so I,

78
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,140
I kind of wanted to demonstrate that,
you know,

79
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:23,050
that there was,
that there's real meat here.

80
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,420
It's not just,
you know,

81
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,440
fantasy or the product of our or young's
and others,

82
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,393
you know,
wild imaginations that these things are 

83
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:33,924
kind of real.

84
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,870
For me,
this podcast,

85
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:35,704
the reason I do it is to educate myself 
and to educate others and to try to in 

86
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:42,580
some way translate the gap that exists 
between academia and what you would call

87
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,433
normal people or everybody else that 
doesn't have access to this sort of 

88
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:49,504
privileged,
a nomenclature of academia of which the 

89
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:54,250
word nomenclature is undoubtedly an 
example.

90
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,363
Like,
so like when you talk about Freud and 

91
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:00,820
young and the psychoanalysis and some of
it's like key ideas.

92
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,953
Like what is the,
it was this distinction between Freud's 

93
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,970
view of the unconscious and young's view
of the unconscious,

94
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:07,930
for example.
Yeah.

95
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:11,500
So Freud put most of the emphasis on,
on sex,

96
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:14,350
I suppose,
and sexuality and also,

97
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,090
um,
uh,

98
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:19,090
the unconscious,
the Freudian unconscious if you want,

99
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:24,130
had much more to do with our own lives,
our relationships with important figures

100
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:29,410
in our lives and particularly our 
parental figures.

101
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,743
Um,
whereas young kind of transcended that 

102
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:34,654
level and talked about the unconscious 
mind with reference to culture and 

103
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,841
religion and mysticism and so it was a 
kind of,

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,020
if you want a sort of deeper aspect of 
our minds,

105
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:51,640
our unconscious minds,
if you want.

106
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:53,740
The young was particularly interested 
in.

107
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,603
He also,
there was a bit of a spat between the 

108
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:57,094
two figures and young felt.
Freud put too much on sex and the 

109
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:06,911
personal [inaudible] I can pretty funny 
marriage or don't get about sex and stop

110
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,470
thinking Freud and young does it come by
me gasoline?

111
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,333
I'm like,
so Freud for everything was coming down 

112
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:21,734
to sex and your individualized life for 
young for that there's enough evidence 

113
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:26,414
to suggest fruit archetypes and 
recurring motifs and themes through 

114
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,810
religions culture to suggest that 
there's some sort of interconnectivity.

115
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,733
Although in Freud's work on like totally
museum and to bu they're an indication 

116
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:38,684
there that if sort of certain taboos a 
recurring for about cultures that that 

117
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,620
in itself is an indication of some sort 
of collectivized mind.

118
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:50,030
I think I touched on it and I think it's
a bit of a slightly,

119
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:50,864
you know,
oversold differentiation that I just 

120
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:54,110
made,
you know,

121
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,670
and,
and Freud was,

122
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,583
um,
would refer to to kind of collective 

123
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,640
aspects of the unconscious.
Freud was more mechanistic,

124
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,190
um,
all the young ones as well.

125
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,173
I think the difference is a kind of 
emphasize perhaps too much because of 

126
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:09,134
this personal spat between the two and 
because they kind of emphasize the 

127
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:15,350
differences,
they emphasize the differences because I

128
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,184
suppose we take for granted the things 
that we share in common and so the 

129
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:21,890
differences start to become pertinent 
and Germane.

130
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:24,350
So from this early interest in 
unconsciousness,

131
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,900
somehow or another,
she started to think it was all right to

132
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,500
sit around doing drugs,
justify yourself.

133
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,480
It wasn't really quite that,
it was more that,

134
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,840
you know,
how can we test this stuff?

135
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,950
Um,
and,

136
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,480
and I was in a seminar one day and,
and they were the seminar leader and the

137
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:42,314
people in the group,
we're talking about all the different 

138
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,790
ways that psychoanalysis had to access 
the unconscious mind.

139
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,360
And the best that it could come up with 
pretty much was dreaming,

140
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,463
you know,
and dreams are brilliant and 

141
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:53,384
fascinating,
but the quite unreliable and minor they 

142
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,124
are now,
they are a crap from one page to the 

143
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:02,520
next absolute codswallop becoming out 
of.

144
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,493
Okay.
So this is the tools of empirical tools 

145
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,600
for accessing the unconscious,
our dreams hypnosis,

146
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,733
that sort of like the recognizable tools
and what a new thing that those tools 

147
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:16,100
are a bit lame.
Yeah.

148
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:16,940
Basically.
Yeah.

149
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:18,110
And you're and you're not,
you know,

150
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,003
and has been proven really.
You're not gonna convince enough people 

151
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,073
with those tools because you know,
people have said a dreams that they're 

152
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:27,530
just chaotic.

153
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,630
The noise,
they don't mean anything.

154
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,860
I'd actually disagree with that.
But yeah,

155
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,420
that's a popular view that there's,
yeah,

156
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,263
a lot of young's work on like say for 
I've written every day about sort of 

157
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,930
compensate every dreams that they're 
like,

158
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,940
that the unconscious mind is at least 
trying to narrativize your life or we're

159
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,610
trying to communicate with you.
And you've talked already about the idea

160
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:48,830
of archetypes.
It seems that when we were like,

161
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,693
you know,
in some senses when we're referring to 

162
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,070
the transcendent over referring to her,
a potent,

163
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,990
an all encompassing being,
it could in fact be regarded.

164
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,853
The,
our own unconscious is the repository 

165
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:05,700
for great information,
great knowledge that we have a kind of a

166
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,563
peculiarly unceremonious and 
inconsistent relationship with these 

167
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,090
aspects of ourselves.
We're absolutely,

168
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:17,091
and this is where psychedelics come in 
because I stumbled across,

169
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,673
kind of stumbled across some literature 
on lsd being used in psychotherapy in 

170
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,170
the fifties and sixties.

171
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,003
And um,
I was just blown away to discover that 

172
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:29,574
the main rationale for using LSD and 
psychotherapy was that it would lower 

173
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:37,290
ego defenses and then allow access to 
this,

174
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,250
you know,
far vaster a realm of our minds,

175
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:43,980
the unconscious mind.
And I just thought this is true.

176
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,403
Had you taken psychedelics by that time?
I'm a bit embarrassed about talking 

177
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:50,970
about.
Not Embarrassing.

178
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:54,420
It's just a sensitive one in I think 
because the stigma,

179
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,433
stigma,
stigma,

180
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,233
stigma of being a scientist studying 
these and the mainstream scientific 

181
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,200
community,
homicides,

182
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,483
what?
You're doing drugs and then they think 

183
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,450
you're a hippie.
You're not a scientist,

184
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:08,070
she's,
yeah,

185
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,400
it's interesting,
isn't it?

186
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,300
But it's in itself a taboo subject and 
it sort of,

187
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:13,260
its origins,
what,

188
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,313
who are the early pioneers around 
psychedelics with Timothy leary or like 

189
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,110
our oldest Huxley,
Ram Dass,

190
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,133
that there were a few people who were 
looking at Mescalin early on in the 

191
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,780
early 20th century.

192
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,353
Uh,
but really a breakthrough happened when 

193
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:29,874
the Swiss chemist,
Albert Hofmann a kind of slightly 

194
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:33,864
serendipitously came across lsd and 
synthesize the lsd while looking for 

195
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:38,880
drugs.
Um,

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,500
uh,
more to do with,

197
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,730
with,
with blood and um,

198
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,011
and,
and,

199
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,330
you know,
the blood system,

200
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,070
he synthesized it.
So for,

201
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:47,690
like go,
like,

202
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,523
so he,
he's working away on drive some sort of 

203
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,390
circuitry trial and these gotta mean 
drugs or what are they related to?

204
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:55,050
Uh,
um,

205
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,720
these fungi that grow on certain 
grasses,

206
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,700
he's working with mushrooms and stuff 
and how,

207
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,810
what is it you come to mushroom related 
and,

208
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,710
and,
uh,

209
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,120
one of the compounds that we synthesize,
one of quite a few was Lsd,

210
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:10,770
25.
Um,

211
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,783
and uh,
the story goes that he got a bit on his 

212
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:16,284
skin and somehow you know,
ingested it and had this like mild 

213
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,470
psychedelic trip and then I think the 
next day he went back and thought,

214
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:28,100
well I'll take a tiny little bit just to
see if,

215
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,380
if it was this lsd 25 that made me feel 
so strange.

216
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,110
So we took 200 mics,
which is quite,

217
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:34,944
I think it's 200,
250 is quite a big dose of Lsd and he 

218
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,500
had a full on,
you know,

219
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,590
mind blowing a trip full of nightmarish 
visions and such like,

220
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,780
Oh I like that cause it sounds a little 
bit like the hulk.

221
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,633
Then it,
he got a little bit on him by accident 

222
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,740
and then it becomes sort of basically 
whole course vitamin,

223
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:55,210
whoever,
because they all follow that template.

224
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:58,140
Some encounter which is bloody union 
idea.

225
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,553
Okay.
And encounter some sort of a mentor 

226
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,330
encounter and then it becomes another 
person and goes back next day,

227
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:09,331
next 250 or whatever of it.
And he goes into some form,

228
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,833
some sort of transcendent realm.
Then what am so between the twenties in 

229
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:14,470
the sixties and you don't start here,
right?

230
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:15,304
So again,
really to what fifties and sixties 

231
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,570
started heating up in the fifties.

232
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,860
People started using lsd in really 
psychoanalytic psychotherapy,

233
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:27,940
which kind of dominated psychiatry.
Then the kind of Freudian model really,

234
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,670
um,
and then into the sixties,

235
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:34,150
things got a bit more colorful and 
people started taking it recreationally.

236
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,310
And then Timothy leary came on the 
scene.

237
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:40,240
He took some magic mushrooms after 
reading an article,

238
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,260
um,
about these tribes in,

239
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:44,094
in Mexico who were taking mushrooms.
And then he took lsd and everything 

240
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:50,440
changed that he kind of,
he was an academic originally.

241
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:51,274
He was at Harvard.
He's some sort of Harvard fuddy duddy 

242
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:56,430
with Dickie bow tie and a suit on.
And before you know it,

243
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:57,820
it's tuned in.
Dropout,

244
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,743
have a nice relaxed.
So this is very curious that like all 

245
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:01,594
these substances or substances,
this idea seems to exist in indigenous 

246
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,360
cultures.
The idea of,

247
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,453
I don't know,
sort of shamanism or plant based 

248
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,233
transcendent experiences is an old idea 
and perhaps in an original idea and 

249
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,254
indigenous idea,
possibly one of somewhere in the 

250
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:24,820
crucible of civilization,
we will find this idea where man becomes

251
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:25,450
religious.

252
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,140
Were man begins to believe.
Do you think it's as important as that?

253
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,570
Is that,
what is the basis of your interesting in

254
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,060
personally interesting psychedelic?
I think there's part of it.

255
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:34,894
So yeah,
the therapeutic side and there's a lot 

256
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:37,700
of,
um,

257
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,620
you know,
very,

258
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,430
um,
deep wisdom to those cultures that use,

259
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,400
that have used psychedelics for maybe 
thousands of years.

260
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,400
Um,
and in a way we're just kind of,

261
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,713
to some extent,
we're rediscovering what those cultures 

262
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,500
always knew,
but we are bringing something new to the

263
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,580
table.
I think we're bringing a,

264
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:00,020
you know,
um,

265
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:05,070
for all our flaws as sort of a western,
um,

266
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,060
you know,
secular people,

267
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,470
uh,
we,

268
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,160
we do have an ability to break things 
down,

269
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:16,660
to deconstruct them and to try and 
understand the mechanisms underneath.

270
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,653
And that's important is it to have an 
understanding of the medicinal and 

271
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:24,991
mechanical operation of these chemicals?
I think so I'd say,

272
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,310
um,
I think it's important to understand how

273
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,570
something works,
you know,

274
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,080
some people would argue that it,
it makes no difference to me to,

275
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,043
to have that knowledge,
but I think sometimes there can be some 

276
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,420
differences,
for example,

277
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:47,830
in where people ascribe the locus of 
action of a drug.

278
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:48,664
So for example,
indigenous people might say that it's 

279
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,154
the plant

280
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,900
that holds an intelligence and we tap in
through taking the plant.

281
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,763
We,
we surrender to it and allow its 

282
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,650
intelligence to guide us that that's the
mushroom or the Ios or wherever.

283
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,610
Yeah,
exactly.

284
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,310
Or they may say that it's the songs,
you know,

285
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:08,144
these eco rose that sharman seeing these
kind of chance that is sung to people 

286
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:14,090
while they're under the influence of,
of say,

287
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:17,080
I want this jungle psychedelic,
um,

288
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,333
whether it's wave or a particle 
somewhere or another is affecting 

289
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:21,884
consciousness.
Whoever is the wave or the vibration 

290
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:24,674
form of the chance or the 
particularities of the substance will 

291
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:29,034
one way or another consciousness is 
being shifted this way versus particle 

292
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:34,940
argument.
That what is the essential element?

293
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,160
What is it?
Is it that there be light?

294
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,830
Let there be matter.
What is it?

295
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,480
What is it about?
What happened?

296
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,190
View Mate,
when you net them bloody drugs.

297
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,820
I want to know all about it clearly 
sounds like you know me.

298
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,910
I'm in recovery.
You don't know me.

299
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:48,260
I'm in recovery.
I don't take.

300
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,170
I've not had taken any drugs at all and 
had a drink one day at a time,

301
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,000
14 and a half years.
Curiously,

302
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,133
Bill Wilson,
the founder of 12 step fellowships 

303
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,373
himself,
became very interested in psychedelics 

304
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:00,734
for a brief while after he got clean 
from alcohol and I think hunger your 

305
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:08,030
man,
Tim leary there for awhile and he wanted

306
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:12,590
to integrate lsd into the 12 steps,
which would be an interesting addition.

307
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,470
Imagine just kind of finding,
finding God,

308
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:16,720
isn't it?
Finding really in a sense.

309
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,563
Yeah.
The twelfth step is having had a 

310
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:21,770
spiritual awakening as the result of 
these steps.

311
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:22,604
We made a decision to turn out life and 
will over God and to practice these 

312
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:26,750
principles in all our affairs.

313
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,910
So eventually I suppose a life of 
altruism,

314
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,900
philanthropy and service based on this 
realization now like me,

315
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:33,734
I like,
even though I work in media and write 

316
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:37,940
children's books,
I am prepared to say that like,

317
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:38,774
um,
I've taken lsd when I was sort of the 

318
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:43,700
first time.
I think I was 16 and something very.

319
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,720
I mean,
it seems.

320
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,501
Well,
I essentially,

321
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:47,900
when you say like that,
it was used in therapy to break down the

322
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:50,280
ego.
I can see what people mean because we're

323
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,140
the most obvious.
The most obvious,

324
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,790
most immediate and most tangible thing I
experienced was,

325
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,920
oh no,
I'm not me.

326
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,840
I remember thinking that.
I remember thinking,

327
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,703
I'm not me.
I'm not what I thought I was this idea 

328
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:07,280
because what I personally felt was very 
chained to my identity.

329
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:08,780
I'm Russell.
I was born at this time.

330
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:09,560
This is what I believe in.

331
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,480
I support West Ham united.
I like Morrissey,

332
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,493
and I remember feeling all that stuff's 
dismantling in a mirror and like the 

333
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,263
feeling somewhat afraid.
I can see why they would need to be 

334
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:20,474
caution,
several mini mentorship and guidance 

335
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,750
when dealing with that.
And I suppose in a secular society,

336
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,973
clinical conditions is what replaces the
idea of ritual or ceremony for Shaman 

337
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,460
guidance,
that sort of businesses.

338
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,483
We're taking it laboratory.
I'm not doing this in a park with Glen 

339
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,670
and dean doing assay and staring at the 
clouds of framing up in a calypso.

340
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,690
I slowly made a bloody laboratory.
No,

341
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,130
I mean in a way.
And we take borrow

342
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,620
from what's gone before and um,
uh,

343
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,473
in terms of the sort of semantic model 
in the sense that we do change the 

344
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,780
laboratory,
you know,

345
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,990
we get rid of the fluorescent lighting 
and there's low thank God and we have,

346
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,870
um,
we have some nice ambient music in hype,

347
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,730
some bloody Pam Power,

348
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:15,950
what you created

349
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,783
in the laboratory.
Laboratory conditions for psychedelics 

350
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,380
means what taught me through what the 
process is.

351
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,630
So,
um,

352
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,700
we'll um,
we'll bring in some,

353
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,470
some low lighting,
um,

354
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:28,843
will a compiler playlists that,
that has a certain structure to chat 

355
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:34,884
someone up.

356
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,640
He'd be there tonight.

357
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,240
Um,
and,

358
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:46,500
uh,
it's gonna sound worse now,

359
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,630
but we built a certain relationship as 
well,

360
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:50,910
so of trust.
It's lovely.

361
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,773
Yeah.
And we try and get to know each other 

362
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:59,690
and kind of lay things on the table and 
we changed literally romantic objects or

363
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,120
no,
say in it,

364
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,840
an atmosphere of trust and open 
communication.

365
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:10,050
How many people were at one time in 
London,

366
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:12,510
England,
and just you and one person.

367
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,570
How does this work?
Uh,

368
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,513
usually two people we call them guides 
or sitters and people are on the level 

369
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:19,450
they have not took nothing.
Uh,

370
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:22,260
usually they have that moment,
that moment.

371
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,380
And I know they're sober that the sober 
guides so visitors',

372
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,260
um,
and uh,

373
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,560
and uh,
you know,

374
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,890
particularly compassionate and,
and encourage a,

375
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,520
um,
uh,

376
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,400
an atmosphere of openness,
of a willingness to let go,

377
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,470
uh,
to explore,

378
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,710
um,
to surrender that analytical mind,

379
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,003
uh,
that I was talking about earlier and to 

380
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:49,380
trust and to kind of go with the flow of
the experience.

381
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,270
What substances have you been working 
with?

382
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,850
Psilocybin?
Magic mushrooms.

383
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,440
So solid.
Simon's in magic,

384
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,660
mushrooms,
lsd a.

385
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,630
Now dmt.
And I have my colleague next to me,

386
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,510
Christian woman who's studying dmt at 
the moment.

387
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,950
I'm an MC as well to help me to 
understand dmt that's based on that show

388
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:12,750
coming song.
I'm quite childish.

389
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,070
A hello a Christian woman or you were 
introduced as a phd student.

390
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:19,420
What you do,
Chris.

391
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,250
Hello.
Welcome.

392
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,083
What you're doing your phd in mate in 
the Phd currently leading a study on 

393
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:27,564
trying to find out what are the effects 
of the brain and kind of like licking 

394
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:32,154
experience and brain.
You're trying to work out that what 

395
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:36,180
have.
So tell me what that involves.

396
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,260
What are you doing,
Chris?

397
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,733
Um,
so we're basically giving the empty to 

398
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,360
um,
a number of healthy participants.

399
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,070
So this young people,
students at imperial college

400
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,913
primary,

401
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,863
not necessarily,
I mean you have a wide range of 

402
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:57,300
interests that people in our studies and
you can have from 20 to 50 years.

403
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,320
Fifty year old people.
Yeah.

404
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,330
Okay.
And talk me through the process.

405
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,120
So,
um,

406
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,540
we have to kind of like main phases of 
the study.

407
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,030
So on the first one we wanted to,
you know,

408
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:10,864
address,
can we give a nice dose of dmt without 

409
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,010
inducing anxiety,
you know,

410
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:19,570
it's such a strong drug that you want to
do it in the best possible way,

411
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,430
but you want to get the effects that 
you're after,

412
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,293
you want to get to those far out sort of
experiences in the best way and safest 

413
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:29,590
way possible.
So we first did a pilot phase,

414
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,440
there was no brain imaging being done 
and you know,

415
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,323
just people were just sitting there and 
the nice environment just chilling and 

416
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,240
we gave them different doses of the 
empty,

417
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,720
a nice setting.

418
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,570
We saw what happened during the 
experience.

419
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,490
We kind of like a,
did interviews,

420
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:52,900
questionnaires kind of like address that
in the most detailed way possible,

421
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,420
trying to map these effects and 
experience.

422
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,760
Um,
and with that we characterize it,

423
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:04,390
will find the right dose.
And now we're moving into actually brain

424
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,980
imaging,
like proper,

425
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:06,814
you know,
how many people did you trial to 

426
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,030
establish what you consider to be the 
right dose?

427
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,253
12 people.
So what did you find across these 12 

428
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:14,650
people?
Uh,

429
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:17,200
we found that,
um,

430
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,990
you got,
we tried out three different doses,

431
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,360
right,
the right dose,

432
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,433
the experience characterized,
but by the right dose for those kind of 

433
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:28,470
like these stages that were,
you know,

434
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,343
we think are very interesting.
So the first one is this kind of like 

435
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,330
bodily rush,
you know,

436
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:37,870
this feeling that people are actually 
expanding outside of their body somehow.

437
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,533
Uh,
then this kind of like entering into a 

438
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:46,111
geometric sort of space,
a very kind of like wonderful,

439
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,560
beautiful,
colorful,

440
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,403
moving geometrical patterns and then 
pushing through into this kind of like 

441
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,480
different sort of space,
you know,

442
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,413
this feeling that you're entering some 
sort of round that it's not coming from 

443
00:22:57,881 --> 00:22:59,170
inside,
but it's actually,

444
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,004
you know,
you're visiting somewhere else and in 

445
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,010
this space,
you know,

446
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,113
many people in Canada,
entities presences that engaged with 

447
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:08,590
them,
communicate with them.

448
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,410
Some receive very meaningful 
information,

449
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,930
some received lake cosmic stuff,
spiritual stuff.

450
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:17,620
Other others have like personal insights
on their lives.

451
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,083
They felt that they were being carried 
by someone through messages of 

452
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:23,230
importance and stuff like that.

453
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,490
I'm curious,
the Corolla Murray,

454
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,373
I'm Chris Rather Robin in what Chris is 
describing in what you said about your 

455
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,373
interest being triggered by the work of 
young and Freud and that there is a 

456
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:42,511
commonality of experience that people 
are describing and that one of the early

457
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:48,530
phases of it is transcendence.
Would you please just tell me a dmt?

458
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,393
What does it stand for?
They methylate tryptamine die methyl 

459
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,993
triptolene.
Yeah.

460
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,863
From what is this substance derived?
It's found in nature and seriousness 

461
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,960
like plant sources.
You can find the actual drug.

462
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,980
Uh,
we,

463
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:04,923
you know,
we buy it from a lab that synthesize it 

464
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:07,304
for,
you know,

465
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,910
a experimental procedures itself,
but you can find it in nature.

466
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:11,744
You can find it in the body as well.
The human body has the substance in it 

467
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,960
suggest anything to you there some 
evidence on it?

468
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:19,580
Yeah.
Well we have very,

469
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:23,420
very small amounts so we don't know if 
it's,

470
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:24,254
you know,
if it actually plays a role into any of 

471
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:28,880
these naturally occurring spiritual 
experiences,

472
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,560
uh,
or if not,

473
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:31,394
or if just maybe some sort of like out 
product of the system just happening by 

474
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:35,710
accident scene.

475
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,423
And nonessential,
I suppose what we're interested in is 

476
00:24:39,951 --> 00:24:40,970
consciousness,
isn't it?

477
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,630
The nature of consciousness,
what is this that's happening to us?

478
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:47,780
What is being,
what is it to experience the information

479
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:52,460
conveyed to us through the senses and to
see ourselves as the sort of participant

480
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,533
in and all three of our own reality.
So anything that can significantly 

481
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,863
disrupt the manner in which we 
understand reality has potentially 

482
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:08,561
profound implications for us as a 
species for the way that we civilize,

483
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,453
socialize an organized one can see why 
it's a substance that's been heavily 

484
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,554
controlled since its inception in the 
sixties when people were working with 

485
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:19,394
Lsd,
there was a point where it began to be 

486
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,930
sort of quite heavily policed,
controlled a band.

487
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,110
Is that true?
Yeah.

488
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,973
Yeah.
And in,

489
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,220
in the late sixties,
um,

490
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,390
a number of states in the US started to,
to make it illegal essentially.

491
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,660
Um,
and uh,

492
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,450
the research was effected by 
implication.

493
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:42,540
Really it was,
it then became not impossible,

494
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,374
but very difficult to do the research.
And actually at one stage it did become 

495
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,320
impossible.
Then I'm a regulatory.

496
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:52,260
People were coming round and 
confiscating psychedelics.

497
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,460
And so there was a very rapid,
I'm about turn in,

498
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,500
um,
Rooney Society's perspective on,

499
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:01,334
on psychedelics,

500
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,740
what was happening in America in the 
late sixties,

501
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
maybe of interest with regard to 
controls on a experimental hallucinogens

502
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:11,840
in soccer.

503
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,673
That takes mean there was a lot going on
culturally in terms of the counter 

504
00:26:15,671 --> 00:26:16,504
culture.
And I think there was some fears that 

505
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,490
maybe lsd was fueling some of that 
political.

506
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,101
Yes.
He's quite likely,

507
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:25,934
isn't it?
If there was a sort of a civil rights 

508
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:28,550
movement,
Vietnam War,

509
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,463
the emergence of counterculture,
the ideas of the beats start to become 

510
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:33,704
in a sense politicized like these,
like the eastern mysticism is now like 

511
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,623
goes through the conduit of American 
literature and poetry and starts to 

512
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,124
become a kind of socializing and 
politicized form is whether it's an 

513
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:51,291
artistic form and one can in a perhaps a
not intubate but conject that if society

514
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:54,834
is an agreement,
if people start looking at society 

515
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,943
differently,
more consciousness differently or 

516
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:01,284
themselves differently,
that potential for change is suddenly 

517
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,213
dramatically enhanced.
Do you think that that's possibly why 

518
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,200
these substances were controlled rather 
than people are worried about,

519
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:12,570
I don't know,
dental care or whether or not people are

520
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:14,430
all right?
I think so.

521
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,283
You know,
in some ways you could characterize it 

522
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:17,514
as the,
the youth becoming more conscious and 

523
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,400
less conformist,
more questioning.

524
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,623
That's exactly what they were doing.
Whether they were doing that anyway or 

525
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:28,164
whether the psychedelics are actually 
fueling those changes because of this 

526
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:34,530
idea that psychedelics broadened 
consciousness.

527
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,200
There's an interest in.
I'm a fan of Terence Mckenna,

528
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:38,280
who's,
I suppose like a,

529
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,470
they're one of the great pioneers,
isn't he?

530
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:42,660
One would say of sort of this sort of 
plant based studies,

531
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,640
but also like for you guys who are 
academics,

532
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:45,474
he must be sort of a controversial 
figure and one of the things we have 

533
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:47,994
this podcast is I become aware that 
there are sort of sanctioned academics 

534
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:52,650
and then these people are like,
oh yeah,

535
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,810
right.
That guy type people.

536
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:55,960
And like,
uh,

537
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,053
an.
Even though I'm a great admirer of 

538
00:27:58,621 --> 00:27:59,454
territory medics,
I think he so lucid and vivid and 

539
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,400
brilliant articular imaginary sort of 
for profit in a sense like that.

540
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,730
I've picked up that there.

541
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,620
He's on the side of the fence of what 
let's not British types of stuff.

542
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:12,700
You know the thing about Terence Mckenna
is he.

543
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,613
He's a fascinating personality,
a great speaker at with incredibly 

544
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,220
interesting ideas.
Now,

545
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:25,221
whether that's true or not is another is
another question and my view is that the

546
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:27,744
jury's out really on a lot of his ideas 
and what the meaning of truth is and 

547
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,683
Bill Hicks,
like one of the Great Comedians have a 

548
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,900
20 a couple of decades ago.
Like he sort of.

549
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,240
He said,
okay,

550
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,103
I think,
I'm guessing maybe got this from a or 

551
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:44,874
maybe from your field this way you guys 
are experts for like a shaman is a 

552
00:28:47,741 --> 00:28:52,741
misery sort of psychedelic plants are 
like an agent of evolution in that is it

553
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,500
has an impact on consciousness and our 
conscious experience.

554
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,930
Now I'm guessing Chris,
mate,

555
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,100
from what you're saying about like these
experiments you've done,

556
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:02,640
that you've had a little go at that dmt 
yourself now if you don't mind,

557
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,823
can you tell me exactly what happened?
His face because I'd like to know all 

558
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:08,910
about it from the process of how it's 
imbibed to what happens to your mind and

559
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:12,780
if you can describe the experience using
so blunted tool as language.

560
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:17,810
I'd like you to do it so,
so just going through it again from when

561
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:19,314
you get a hit on the pipe and then what 
happens in your brain and not like from 

562
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,170
a screen from,
from experiencing it.

563
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,300
Yeah.
So it all begins with this intense,

564
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:34,010
very,
very intense rushing the body,

565
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,223
you know,
there's this kind of like it feels like 

566
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:39,590
this very strong flow of energy going 
through.

567
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,820
You know,
what people describe how much she piping

568
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,860
and say you're putting it on a foil on a
bottle and go,

569
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,380
hey,
people usually do.

570
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:49,330
Yeah.
How you doing?

571
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,540
Because he's in a university.
Does it look a little bit less under the

572
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,780
bridge?
Uh,

573
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,780
well yeah.
I mean I can,

574
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,933
but rather not.
You think the mechanics of it are 

575
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,660
worrying,
are they,

576
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,700
it worries you guys to talk about it?
Not really.

577
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:04,241
No.
No,

578
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:05,990
but we give it intravenously so it's 
not,

579
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:09,180
it's not like a needle in a needle.
Yeah.

580
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,460
Yeah.
Okay.

581
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,873
And then so you like,
so you give people a little and if you 

582
00:30:15,551 --> 00:30:16,384
take it,
do you take it intravenously or do you 

583
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:22,290
smoke it?
If I would have to take.

584
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,630
Is there an eagle you're worried about 
illegal stuff or professional stuff?

585
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,500
Oh yeah.
Okay.

586
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,360
If you hypothetically,
let's say hypothetically,

587
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:32,460
you know,
how would you define it?

588
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,410
Smugged would be the easiest.

589
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,953
I'd worry about the old lungs on that.
I'd probably go straight for the 

590
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,573
straight for the old main system brought
into the brain and to the nape of the 

591
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:47,020
neck.
I'd like it.

592
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,060
I'm like,
no,

593
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,150
but I don't do drugs and I think,
you know,

594
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,023
like as a person in recovery,
I think you have to be very careful 

595
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,893
though.
There's a lot of talk that psychedelics 

596
00:30:52,681 --> 00:30:56,400
can influence addictive behaviors and 
issues around dependencies.

597
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:57,234
It's a very,
very interesting area when it comes 

598
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,483
because I,
my personal belief is the addiction 

599
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,910
stems from trying to solve a spiritual,
emotional,

600
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:06,803
psychological issue for external mean to
have that sexual behavior or average 

601
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:11,094
extreme behaviors around food or 
gambling or but most notably and 

602
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:17,820
obviously dependency and reliance on 
alcohol and drugs.

603
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:21,080
Now I don't see how someone could become
dependent on this experience where first

604
00:31:21,081 --> 00:31:22,500
of all,
you feel a tremendous rush on the body.

605
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,460
Then you have some experience of 
geometry suggesting that geometry is one

606
00:31:26,461 --> 00:31:27,294
of the archetypal things that exist.
I didn't Greeks were on to something 

607
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:34,050
that geometry is actual ways of energy 
and shapes and performing and then after

608
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:34,884
that you go into what some domed realm 
where there appear to be entities 

609
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:40,080
communicating with you and what do 
people say these?

610
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,340
Tell me about that bit.

611
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,920
That's a very interesting thing.
I mean there's this kinda like there was

612
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:46,763
this transition from the space of the 
geometries into this actual kind of 

613
00:31:49,831 --> 00:31:50,860
like,
you know,

614
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:51,803
different sort of space,
different realm that feels alive and it 

615
00:31:55,531 --> 00:31:57,690
feels very true as well.
For many people.

616
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,700
I mean,
if the dose is high enough,

617
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,563
you know,
people kind of reliably go into this 

618
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:06,440
space and this space can be full of 
color,

619
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,310
different objects.
Not necessarily.

620
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:11,700
You will get the same sort of like 
shapes NTT.

621
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:14,800
Some people speak about alien,
so people speak about Goblin.

622
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:19,140
Some people don't even speak about 
visual evidence entities.

623
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,330
Just something being alive around you.

624
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,113
Yes,
because I suppose that would be 

625
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,460
interpretive.
A friend of mine,

626
00:32:25,461 --> 00:32:26,294
he's been on this podcast,
Simon amps still using a British 

627
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:30,450
comedian.
He said that when he.

628
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,303
He like with his experience with Ios guy
that he said that he's described that 

629
00:32:34,431 --> 00:32:36,740
the different people in the group,
he was in a group out of six people,

630
00:32:36,741 --> 00:32:37,660
he said and like,
Hey,

631
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:40,160
as a sort of a secularized Jewish 
person,

632
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,253
a experienced these guiding psychiatrist
and there was a Hindu person who hadn't 

633
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,413
experienced with Ganash and a Christian 
person who had Christ like divinity 

634
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,573
needs an Avatar.
The divine comes to you in the form of 

635
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:53,300
a,
of an image,

636
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:55,820
which is really just a form of geometry,
I suppose,

637
00:32:55,821 --> 00:32:56,654
loose geometry,
but like everyone's having the same 

638
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,880
essential experience of there is there 
is an authority,

639
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,190
there is something accessible to 
consciousness.

640
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,710
Which you said there Chris and you said 
also Robin,

641
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,190
maybe external may not be.
Yeah.

642
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,450
Well of course you're seeing Jesus.
You just took it.

643
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:14,210
You just injected yourself with a big 
arm full of delicious.

644
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,440
What?
Demo method.

645
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:16,274
Triptolene

646
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,800
they methylate tryptamine.
Yeah.

647
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,650
Say what?
What is this?

648
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:20,484
Why do people think it might be external
because of the consistency of the 

649
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:22,620
experience.

650
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,970
It's an.
It's an interesting.

651
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,220
Definitely an interesting question.
I mean,

652
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,060
the thing is that it's always a drug.
You know,

653
00:33:30,061 --> 00:33:32,040
it's an actual thing.
Entering your body,

654
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,960
you know,
costing these experiences,

655
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,110
the feeling,
the experience of your wheel.

656
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:36,944
I mean feels three wheel and it's.
I think it's definitely something to 

657
00:33:39,991 --> 00:33:43,230
respect people.
People feel there's some authority.

658
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:44,064
There's something external,
something that you knew or bow down in 

659
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:50,040
some sort of way you respect deeply.
That being said,

660
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,100
I'm not necessarily,
you know,

661
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,230
it is something real or that something 
that exists to actually outside of realm

662
00:33:58,231 --> 00:34:01,590
of personal experience,
we don't know these things.

663
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:02,424
It's difficult.
It's difficult to access them from a 

664
00:34:04,351 --> 00:34:06,850
scientific point of view,
you know,

665
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,950
most,
most,

666
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,110
most things around.
Yeah.

667
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,180
Inside of us,
you know,

668
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,160
most,
most things,

669
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,310
most objects,
you know,

670
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:15,730
most entities are outside of us.
And even when we dream,

671
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,340
we think we're in a world where things 
are outside of us,

672
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:20,830
you know,
but we know that,

673
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,940
that um,
uh,

674
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:23,783
you know,
play if you want is being played out in 

675
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,093
our minds and we know that there are 
changes in brain activity that account 

676
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:30,874
for it.
And it's a similar thing with 

677
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:32,260
psychedelics.
I mean,

678
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,760
we know,
you know,

679
00:34:33,761 --> 00:34:38,020
with very high reliability that they 
work on a particular aspect of the brain

680
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:40,810
that they work on a particular 
neurotransmitter system,

681
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:43,480
a particular receptors,
serotonin receptor,

682
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,370
if you block it,
you don't trip,

683
00:34:45,371 --> 00:34:46,204
you don't see the entities to really all
the evidence is that it comes from the 

684
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:51,430
brain.
It comes from the mind.

685
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,750
But there's a thing that humans do,
which they,

686
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:59,070
they have an inclination to do,
which is to kind of externalize,

687
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,260
know to project and say it's out there.
The realm is,

688
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,530
is real,
it's another dimension.

689
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,383
You know,
these entities are actually aliens that 

690
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:08,584
come from wherever.
So we've become certainly in a way 

691
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:14,980
overly sensual and overly materialistic.
It becomes our main interpretive tool is

692
00:35:14,981 --> 00:35:15,814
to regard phenomenon is external as 
opposed to internal possibly could 

693
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,433
continually go to bias to see things 
have this bias of externalizing and 

694
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:26,650
materializing.
Why do we have this bias?

695
00:35:26,651 --> 00:35:27,484
Why do we have it?

696
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,413
Alright?
And I'm interested in so many things 

697
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:33,640
here.
Mostly getting out of my neck,

698
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,590
I'd always have to be very,
very careful.

699
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:37,980
I've got

700
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,970
great deal of respect and indeed fear of
drugs because of the way that it made my

701
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:45,150
life go or really,
really badly wrong.

702
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,193
But like what I'm interested in,
I sort of thing I think is the 

703
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:50,520
exploration of this world now.
When you would,

704
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,463
under these clinical studies,
if illusions in the studies that 

705
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:55,740
yourselves,
that you were conducting and in previous

706
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:59,220
studies,
what part of the brain is being impacted

707
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,040
and what can we learn from that?
Yeah,

708
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,340
well it starts with the serotonin system
and the molecules come in Serotonin,

709
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,480
where else would we see that effect?
But there's loads of it in the gut.

710
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,860
Um,
but we've got a lot of,

711
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,850
in our brains.
There isn't such a massive,

712
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,703
you know,
there's a kind of relationship with 

713
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:17,400
those,
with those systems.

714
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:20,020
And people talk about visceral feelings 
this or is.

715
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:21,631
Yeah,
exactly.

716
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:22,950
Gut Instinct.
Um,

717
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,813
so yeah,
so serotonin is in the brain and it 

718
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:27,570
modulates arrange range of different 
things,

719
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:29,220
states of consciousness,
sleep,

720
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,840
mood,
the way we think.

721
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,093
And psychedelics kind of hijack the 
serotonin system in a certain aspect of 

722
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:39,450
it.
And then kind of pickle a particular way

723
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,320
it seems,
right?

724
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,980
Cheeky little devil doesn't it again in 
there to away on the systems.

725
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,720
And uh,
and then at the kind of broader level in

726
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:52,770
terms of the whole of the brain that 
changes networks in the brain.

727
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:56,100
And that's the way we tend to think 
about brain function these days.

728
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:59,460
We don't think of all this bit here does
this,

729
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:00,294
you know,
it's like this distributed system that 

730
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:03,204
often encompasses the whole of the brain
with bits at the front and bits at the 

731
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:06,740
back.
Yeah.

732
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,603
No.
Does something like know vision or 

733
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,400
movement or.
Yeah.

734
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,433
This model of compartmentalization 
likely come from the period of 

735
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:18,300
industrialization.
That of which a lot of these discoveries

736
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:22,410
were made in when we saw mechanistic 
models as being compartmentalized and as

737
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:27,411
we realized a time where our technology 
is understood in terms of cybernetics,

738
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:32,250
that we start to look at consciousness 
and the brain as a comparable entity.

739
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,280
It's unlikely that he was looking out 
the window button,

740
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,850
go to the toilet tree.
Instead,

741
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:40,770
the,
as DMRC would say,

742
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:43,200
just the mind rules the body.
Does the body roll the mind?

743
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,470
I've done a little bit circular.
Yeah,

744
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:47,280
right.
There's one.

745
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,440
Where are these?
Where are these boundaries?

746
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:50,274
Where are these lines?
Who's drawing them in and for what 

747
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:54,170
reason?
Okay.

748
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,023
So like one of the things that happens 
is serotonin transmission and reception 

749
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:03,570
starts going all I knew real well,
and that that creates a conditions of,

750
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,640
of plasticity or a potential for change.
Um,

751
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,620
and you know,
in those kind of looser conditions,

752
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,930
the constraints on brain function,
the way the brain's working,

753
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,290
um,
are,

754
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:25,350
are sort of lifted and the brain can 
operate in a much freer away.

755
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:31,140
And what happens under those conditions 
is the brain networks that we know,

756
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:33,930
that we know serve different functions 
like vision,

757
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:34,764
like moving,
like,

758
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,990
like high level things,
like even consciousness.

759
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,860
They begin to break down,
they begin to dissolve and disintegrate.

760
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,263
And when they do that,
another interesting thing that happens 

761
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:48,700
when you look at the whole of the brain 
is that these systems become less,

762
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,070
uh,
different from each other.

763
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:55,810
They kind of start to blend in to each 
other and those two things.

764
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:56,644
So the disintegration of networks and 
the kind of coming together of networks 

765
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:02,910
and the sort of blending relate.
Uh,

766
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,753
so we've seen.
And so we think to some of the kind of 

767
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,720
most abstract aspects of the experience.
So one of them is a,

768
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,720
these reports of ego dissolution that 
you were talking about earlier,

769
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,780
you know that that sense that your 
narrative self,

770
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:20,614
you know who Russell is,
is being compromised and you're just as 

771
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,573
awake just as consciousness,
but all of a sudden that narrative self 

772
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,100
destruct away and the other one is that 
you might feel when that happens,

773
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:34,240
first of all,
a fear,

774
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,523
but also if that's transcended a sense 
of connecting to something bigger in a 

775
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,870
sense of connectedness,
a sense of oneness.

776
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,393
That's interesting.
So the ego one's idea of a narrative it 

777
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:54,070
self as sort of a physical entity with a
story and a life in a perspective.

778
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,470
When that dissolves,
there's a sense of connection and relief

779
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:00,304
and release that I do remember I took it
I think quite a lot for a while and 

780
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,630
sometimes it felt very brilliant and 
beautiful and I enjoyed it.

781
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:10,000
But remember I wasn't taking it under 
laboratory conditions.

782
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,720
I was taking it under the probably the 
worst conditions you could take it under

783
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,093
ethics in the first case is.
And then sort of like hanging out in 

784
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:19,114
like sort of people's bedsits in new 
cross gate and like with people with 

785
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,450
themselves,
just young men and like you know,

786
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:28,600
that sort of 18 year old lads and for 
example,

787
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:31,060
it's not the worst thing that ever 
happened to me and check this out.

788
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,270
Like everyone sort of got a load of 
acid,

789
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,253
like sheets of the staff and I obviously
as a very keen young drug user for that 

790
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,233
are left that and went and swapped my 
bike for a good sheet of it and like 

791
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,074
everyone pretended one night that they 
were all doing some and they all just 

792
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,490
get a little bit of paper which is the 
form that it was delivered in and I took

793
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:52,324
real acid but they only had a bit of 
paper in an hour in as Mike tripped 

794
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,100
kicking in.
They all go,

795
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,870
guess what?
We didn't take acid.

796
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,930
So I'm now on a trip that requires,
as you said,

797
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:05,170
in laboratory conditions,
trust release and all of that.

798
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,120
And I'm told that none of the rest of 
them are doing it.

799
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,980
Man.
I was not happy that day.

800
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,560
I didn't like it because I was starting 
like,

801
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,020
you know,
my,

802
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,821
again,
I'm a,

803
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:14,920
yeah,
I'm an adolescent male so my identity is

804
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,350
forming.
My ego is a fragile thing.

805
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,273
Anyway,
coming from the background that I came 

806
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:22,390
from and you know,
I remember like feeling very,

807
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:25,180
very disruptive and very,
very frightened and very afraid.

808
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:26,014
I mean so that these psychedelic drugs 
and not things to be toyed around with 

809
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,150
lightly.
But I think there's sort of this general

810
00:41:31,151 --> 00:41:33,800
awareness and sort of.
I'm a big fan of Daniel Pinchbeck.

811
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:34,160
He writes

812
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,993
a lot about sort of taken different 
plant by plant medicines and stuff and 

813
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:40,260
different cultures and stuff.
Uh,

814
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,133
I think that there's important and 
potentially revolutionary information 

815
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,080
held in these plant substances.

816
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,350
I agree with that and people have said 
the psychedelics are kind of,

817
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,380
you know,
there are kind of apart from other drugs

818
00:41:55,381 --> 00:41:57,120
and there's a bit of evidence to support
that.

819
00:41:57,121 --> 00:41:59,970
So for example,
this big population study in theU ,

820
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,913
s looked at united some 200,000
people and then looked at patterns of 

821
00:42:04,351 --> 00:42:05,184
drug use and the relationship to mental 
health and found the psychedelics stood 

822
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:11,700
out like a sore thumb because all other 
drugs,

823
00:42:11,701 --> 00:42:13,920
the more you take the worse your mental 
health.

824
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,053
But psychedelics,
the more he took the lower was 

825
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,490
psychological distress and the lower was
suicidality.

826
00:42:20,491 --> 00:42:21,324
The two measures that they looked at.
So people have questioned whether you 

827
00:42:24,871 --> 00:42:29,610
can even call psychedelics recreational 
drugs because at least in principle they

828
00:42:29,611 --> 00:42:30,444
should have been taken for recreation.
Maybe self exploration or therapeutic 

829
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:35,850
work but not,
you know,

830
00:42:35,851 --> 00:42:37,320
not a party or

831
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,221
whatever.
Yeah,

832
00:42:38,221 --> 00:42:39,054
because I remember black,
my impulse in taking those substances 

833
00:42:40,951 --> 00:42:43,830
when I was in fact in all drugs,
I want it to get out of myself.

834
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:44,664
I've felt like trapped and him sort of 
in pain and like also the other thing 

835
00:42:48,301 --> 00:42:49,134
curiously that felt is what we're 
experiencing is reality is not the 

836
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:54,920
ultimate reality.
There's something else I wanted that.

837
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:55,923
So I kept puffing loads of weed then 
drinking loads and doing enough for 

838
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,640
drugs and eventually I'm going to crack 
and heroin addict,

839
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,900
but the thing that had this odd 
transcendent and what do I want to say,

840
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:06,120
sort of like uncanny,
almost macabre.

841
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,010
I feel it even when we're talking about 
it,

842
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,043
when I start to feel this,
the tendrils that connects me to my 

843
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:13,434
personal self flexing and being tugged 
because something in me knows there is 

844
00:43:18,091 --> 00:43:22,740
another world and it's difficult because
it's the domain primarily of religion to

845
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:25,470
say that the material world is an 
illusion.

846
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,690
None of this stuff really matters.
We're all one.

847
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,553
These tropes are found in religion.
Now what you're doing is bringing these 

848
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:37,671
ideas are exploring these ideas in 
academia and in chemistry and he,

849
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:43,350
and it seems it's sort of somewhat laden
with taboo and prohibition.

850
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:46,410
Even within your field I've sent you,
you're both cautious about talking about

851
00:43:46,411 --> 00:43:48,950
it in a personal way.
Why?

852
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,560
Well,
it's a lot different aspects there.

853
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:53,770
But uh,
you know,

854
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,530
uh,
I guess,

855
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,700
um,
I mean the stigma is a massive thing.

856
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:00,450
And uh,
and it's like we're kind of

857
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,730
walking a very thin line,
you know,

858
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,593
you've got the enthusiasts,
so on one side the psychedelic 

859
00:44:06,331 --> 00:44:08,850
enthusiastic that might look in and say,
oh,

860
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:10,530
these guys are so dry,
the such,

861
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,510
you know,
such scientists,

862
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,300
you know,
they're boring or whatever,

863
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,870
and then you've got the way that I like.
Yeah.

864
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,050
And then we've got the,
you know,

865
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,920
the mainstream,
on the other hand,

866
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:24,000
you look in and think,
oh,

867
00:44:24,001 --> 00:44:25,980
they're not real scientists.
They study psychedelics,

868
00:44:25,981 --> 00:44:28,110
they must be hippies.
I bet they'd take closer psychedelics.

869
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,070
So there's a really sort of difficult 
line to walk and personally,

870
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:35,100
you know,
a major motivation is to try and broaden

871
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:36,750
that walkway in a way,
you know,

872
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,830
to kind of eat into some of the mystical
aspects.

873
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:44,900
And although people won't like this kind
of secularized them and,

874
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,960
and I don't see that as a threat,
although some people will see it as kind

875
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:50,680
of bridge building,
um,

876
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:51,983
and translation like it really needs to 
be a Rosetta stone of the spiritual 

877
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:01,611
experience to the material experience 
because materialism is our dogma.

878
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,470
How are we going to get information 
over?

879
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,470
Yeah.
And if you make it dogmatic,

880
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:08,130
but,
you know,

881
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:08,963
personally I wouldn't ever want to 
depreciate things like an entity 

882
00:45:12,121 --> 00:45:12,954
experience and I think something,
but sometimes people are threatened by 

883
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:16,411
it and think,
oh,

884
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:17,244
you're trying to explain away this 
experience that changed my life or 

885
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:20,910
whatever,
and,

886
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,290
and say,
you know,

887
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:26,790
you want to say it's all brain activity 
and I don't personally,

888
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:27,624
I don't want to do that at all.
I'd rather allow that way of looking at 

889
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:32,640
things to just sit.
I suppose,

890
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,670
you know,
motivation would say.

891
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,510
I think it's interesting to understand 
how the hell it happens,

892
00:45:39,511 --> 00:45:40,870
you know?
Um,

893
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,550
and so for me it's not explaining away,
it's just explaining.

894
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:45,384
It's a bit like,
you know,

895
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:49,350
the wonder of nature.
It still is magical and beautiful,

896
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,090
you know,
um,

897
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:54,210
whether you understand how,
how a tree grows or whatever.

898
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:55,703
That's right.
And regard and however far one goes 

899
00:45:57,331 --> 00:45:58,164
materialistically mechanistically for 
whichever scientific discipline one is 

900
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:02,400
still left with the question of,
well,

901
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:03,870
how,
why?

902
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:04,763
What's motivating this in,
what is it Ctda what in thrones this 

903
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:11,400
procedure?
And I think you're right,

904
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:12,234
I agree with you entirely that the more 
that there can be description and 

905
00:46:14,761 --> 00:46:19,710
translation of these ideas,
the more it will benefit it's advanced.

906
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,670
What's your personal motivation in 
carrying out these studies?

907
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,100
What do you want to do?
What do you want to achieve?

908
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,013
Education is one thing.
Like I'd like it to be more normalized 

909
00:46:32,671 --> 00:46:33,870
and,
and less,

910
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,300
um,
I don't know.

911
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:37,770
Easter terrick,
you know,

912
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:41,700
the unconscious mind that it be 
something that's taught to kids even,

913
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:42,534
you know,
I think that will help to broaden our 

914
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,593
population's consciousness.
Talk about unconscious unconscious in a 

915
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:51,001
way.
You know,

916
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:52,680
we were talking about indigenous 
cultures.

917
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,330
Maybe they have some of that,
you know,

918
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:57,600
and often quite healthy cultures.
Um,

919
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:58,470
you know,
it's,

920
00:46:58,471 --> 00:46:59,304
it's less taboo and maybe some of that 
kind of parcel eating is something that 

921
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,860
the western people have done,
you know,

922
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,690
particularly sort of,
you know,

923
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:08,270
zealously.
Yeah.

924
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,300
Uh,
and so there's a motivation to normalize

925
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,520
A.
I don't want psychedelics,

926
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:15,354
the vso esoteric.
I don't want the unconscious mind and 

927
00:47:17,491 --> 00:47:22,350
psychoanalysis to be so unusual and 
taboo and stigmatized,

928
00:47:22,351 --> 00:47:24,450
you know,
there is a motivation to,

929
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:28,110
to bring it into the mainstream and to,
you know,

930
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,980
get people talking about it and thinking

931
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,650
about it and I think in being more 
conscious for ourselves,

932
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,700
we're less likely to perhaps harm 
ourselves and others.

933
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:37,953
God,
that's a very beautiful and important 

934
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,433
idea.
I'm intrigued by it because I feel that 

935
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:50,430
we are all to content to dismiss 
activity that we all experience,

936
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:52,744
like we all do dream every night.
This amazing thing that happens in 

937
00:47:55,571 --> 00:47:58,290
everyone's mind most days and just go,
oh,

938
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,980
crack on.
Pay The gas bill.

939
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,520
I'll know mortgage rates have gone up 
for let's have another foreign war.

940
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,473
And every night all of us tumble into 
some glorious world of wonder where our 

941
00:48:08,171 --> 00:48:09,004
own life is rerender there's a myth and 
that the information that's in there is 

942
00:48:12,611 --> 00:48:13,444
somehow ignored.
And that the fact that there is 

943
00:48:15,341 --> 00:48:18,760
obviously sort of potential to 
understand ourselves differently.

944
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:21,900
A book that I have written is it about,
you know,

945
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,833
sort of is about how my method of 
recovery that I was given the 12 step 

946
00:48:27,221 --> 00:48:32,221
method was a way of recognizing that the
model I had of myself was ineffective,

947
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:33,723
was an ineffective way of living and 
that I needed to go on a journey of 

948
00:48:36,701 --> 00:48:40,000
being a different kind of man to succeed
in the world.

949
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,630
And my sense is that prohibition around 
philosophy,

950
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:44,464
prohibition around substances.
I know I find it very difficult to 

951
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:48,094
regard the state,
particularly when you talk about this 

952
00:48:48,941 --> 00:48:49,774
period of inception in the sixties,
is as parental and loving when so many 

953
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:55,624
of its aims and objectives have been 
subsequently revealed to be the 

954
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,203
mendacious.
So is there like it's likely that 

955
00:49:03,581 --> 00:49:07,720
prohibition around psychedelics shares 
that objective,

956
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:12,750
but if more people experience this and 
it was probably like shamanism,

957
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,133
culturally is not for everybody.
Not everybody in the tribe goes off 

958
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:20,920
every bloody day and wanders around in 
theory,

959
00:49:20,921 --> 00:49:24,370
all realms and in the unconscious mind 
and is expected to interpret it.

960
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,310
Different types of people have different
types of abilities,

961
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:31,420
but some people should be experiencing 
different aspects of the unconscious and

962
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:35,500
all of us should have a different way of
relating to ourselves in totality,

963
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,300
not just,
oh well I'm just this boat.

964
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,990
And then like deathbed lives,
I should have done more by.

965
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,440
I'd love me.
I just simply couldn't cope.

966
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,793
So like,
um,

967
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,120
like what is the,
tell me,

968
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:52,390
what is the ongoing,
ongoing intention for these studies?

969
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:53,260
What's going on?
Well,

970
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:55,320
we do more clinical work.
Um,

971
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,193
we're looking at psilocybin magic 
mushrooms as a treatment for depression 

972
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:01,623
and we,
we've done that already and got an idea 

973
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:06,100
that it works and some idea of how it 
works,

974
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,860
but now probably.
But that serotonin stuff,

975
00:50:08,861 --> 00:50:09,694
right?
It's Serotonin and it works on those 

976
00:50:11,201 --> 00:50:13,380
networks I was talking about earlier.
Um,

977
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,190
and um,
and,

978
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,280
and sort of reset mechanism as well.
It seems to be going on,

979
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,143
you know,
that's curious what like the narrative 

980
00:50:20,381 --> 00:50:21,640
can be interrupted thing.
No,

981
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:22,900
I'm not,
it's not happening now.

982
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,793
I'm not being abused now.
I suppose you can kind of scramble up 

983
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:28,400
and dissolve

984
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,660
it,
but it comes back,

985
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:30,523
you know,
but it comes back like a malfunctioning 

986
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:37,070
computer is rebooted and it comes back 
and it's functioning again normally.

987
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,510
Um,
yeah,

988
00:50:38,511 --> 00:50:40,400
that's something to test more as we go 
on.

989
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,263
But it's a,
have you had some negative stuff then 

990
00:50:42,731 --> 00:50:44,540
having to have somebody go proper 
crackers?

991
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,380
Yes,
absolutely.

992
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:46,850
Well,
um,

993
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,510
it can be nightmarish.
We,

994
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:49,583
you know,
we can have patients whaling during the 

995
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:54,040
session when they're literally,
you know,

996
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,640
facing demons and,
and you know,

997
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:59,300
our,
when they come back and they go,

998
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:00,070
oh,
it was terrible.

999
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:02,650
This thing got me where I was abused as 
a kid and that just really lived it.

1000
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:04,220
I know that,
that kind of thing.

1001
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,690
Um,
and uh,

1002
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:10,691
and so they need to feel like they can 
go there and this has literally happened

1003
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,780
that killed himself or anything mad.
Yeah.

1004
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:13,521
No,
no,

1005
00:51:13,521 --> 00:51:14,120
not,
not,

1006
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,953
not that,
but the experience itself is incredibly 

1007
00:51:17,181 --> 00:51:17,720
challenging.

1008
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,553
I can imagine it being traumatic.
I've experienced it to be traumatic 

1009
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,960
staring around in your own unconscious.
It's going to be traumatic.

1010
00:51:22,961 --> 00:51:25,120
There's all sorts of crap mine around in
there and addressed,

1011
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:25,760
but like,
you know,

1012
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,593
just someone having a traumatic time 
ain't necessarily a negative thing 

1013
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,493
because at least you're living it and,
and there can be breakthrough and so 

1014
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:33,884
this is a thing and we encourage the 
patients to look the demons in the eye 

1015
00:51:36,501 --> 00:51:41,060
and sometimes those demons are kind of 
manifestations of an abuser say and when

1016
00:51:41,061 --> 00:51:46,061
they do that they get this curious like 
shift in perspective and they'll see the

1017
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:49,250
abuser as a,
almost as a victim,

1018
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,173
you know,
that they can sort of see the chain of 

1019
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:53,840
causality that led to them,
you know,

1020
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,733
being so you know,
damage that they would do something 

1021
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,693
damaging.
These results can be achieved 

1022
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,310
therapeutically.

1023
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:01,143
Also,
sort of the reframing in sort of say 

1024
00:52:02,851 --> 00:52:06,590
neuro linguistic programming would be 
about like looking at the perpetrator of

1025
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:11,150
abuse as themselves.
As you say a victim like that,

1026
00:52:11,151 --> 00:52:11,811
you know,
that you cook,

1027
00:52:11,811 --> 00:52:12,644
but I'm imagining you could probably do 
that a lot quicker with a healthy dose 

1028
00:52:16,071 --> 00:52:17,870
of psilocybin.
People say that,

1029
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,733
you know,
famously said about psychedelics that 

1030
00:52:20,001 --> 00:52:22,040
they can be like years of therapy,
you know,

1031
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:22,874
in a few hours.
The danger is you always feel like we 

1032
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:26,834
should put a caveat on it because we 
talked a lot about the environment and 

1033
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:32,530
the context and I do think it's true 
that you know,

1034
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,800
in,
in the wrong context,

1035
00:52:33,801 --> 00:52:34,634
psychedelics could be harmful.
Person was mentally unwell in inverted 

1036
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:45,491
commerce is probably not a good idea to 
take any mind altering substances alone.

1037
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:47,893
And I think my personal belief is that 
the addiction phenomena is a result of 

1038
00:52:51,261 --> 00:52:52,094
people medicating themselves in a 
society that doesn't know how to treat 

1039
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:58,550
them and has no real desire to take care
of the mentally ill.

1040
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,400
I was smoking weed,
I was drinking because I was in pain and

1041
00:53:01,401 --> 00:53:02,234
I couldn't cope.
And curiously the other thing is I 

1042
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:04,544
already said was I had a powerful 
curiosity about what was going on in my 

1043
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,040
mind,
my experience.

1044
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:11,043
A colleague of mine,
a Rosalind Watson has done some nice 

1045
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:15,160
work around this theme of connectedness.
You know,

1046
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,980
in a lot of mental disorders and 
probably addiction.

1047
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,873
You know,
people suffer from a feeling of being 

1048
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:25,270
isolated and being disconnected from 
things and they might be disconnected or

1049
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,113
say for meaning

1050
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:26,973
united does a sense of meaninglessness 
and what seems to happen with 

1051
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:32,250
psychedelics when,
when there is a breakthrough,

1052
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:36,510
is that people feel this strong sense of
reconnection.

1053
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:38,063
I'd like to know on a personal level 
what experience used to have of people 

1054
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:46,221
in recovery taking these subsidiaries 
because I'm in recovery.

1055
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:48,990
I'd like to know about people with five,
10,

1056
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:51,900
15,
20 years plus in recovery from drugs and

1057
00:53:51,901 --> 00:53:55,830
alcohol using these substances and 
they're not going off and relapse in and

1058
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:56,693
holding up a gas station and kicking 
over some bins on their way out of the 

1059
00:53:59,641 --> 00:54:00,474
lab there.
There's no evidence that psychedelics 

1060
00:54:03,481 --> 00:54:05,050
promote relapse.
And,

1061
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:06,380
and like I was saying earlier,
they're,

1062
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,440
they kind of are sort of,
uh,

1063
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,140
you know,
drugs apart from other drugs in a way,

1064
00:54:11,141 --> 00:54:13,380
you know,
they're not more wish than not addictive

1065
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:15,570
in themselves.
In fact,

1066
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,553
after psychedelic experience,
people often say either never again or 

1067
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,450
not for awhile.
You know,

1068
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:26,340
even if it's,
if it's transformative and euphoric,

1069
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:27,253
um,
they usually have to go through a tough 

1070
00:54:28,711 --> 00:54:33,330
time to get there.
So they're not hedonic drugs really,

1071
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,920
you know,
they're not hedonic.

1072
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,360
Right.
Cool.

1073
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,370
Hi.
Tell us some of your greatest hit.

1074
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:41,250
Some of the things people have seen,
some of the things people have come back

1075
00:54:41,251 --> 00:54:42,630
with.
Gosh,

1076
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:43,464
Chris too.

1077
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,070
Yeah.
So,

1078
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:48,160
uh,
okay.

1079
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,840
I have one of our last participant,
uh,

1080
00:54:53,841 --> 00:54:55,230
she,
you know,

1081
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,083
she was going through the pace of the 
place of the geometry you see pushed 

1082
00:54:58,491 --> 00:54:59,324
through,
but she couldn't push through any 

1083
00:55:01,911 --> 00:55:04,310
further because there were some,
you know,

1084
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,453
is not letting her go by and somehow a 
bit kind of like punishing her because 

1085
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:12,590
of the audacity of going into this 
realm.

1086
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,620
Right.
Um,

1087
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:18,380
so that was quite scary for her.
Right.

1088
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:20,660
So this kind of like first entity 
encounter,

1089
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,540
but then slowly,
slowly she started,

1090
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:24,374
you know,
kind of like going through this haze of 

1091
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,390
clouds.
Uh,

1092
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,233
and then they were entities like 
chanting all around her and healing her 

1093
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,230
as she came back from the experience.

1094
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:42,740
Oh Man.
Yeah.

1095
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,753
No.
Unless the clinical conditions and the 

1096
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:47,724
clinical conditions.
I'm still undecided because I live my 

1097
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,430
life one day at a time.
Wow.

1098
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:52,090
That sounds pretty good,
doesn't it?

1099
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:55,770
I mean even just the idea that there's 
things in your unconscious mind.

1100
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,660
I mean dreams are in themselves.
Evidence.

1101
00:55:57,661 --> 00:55:58,494
You don't need to take drugs to see that
there's stuff going on in your 

1102
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:02,070
unconscious mind that you don't know 
about.

1103
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:04,380
In fact,
just look at your own hand right now.

1104
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,070
Some things pumping blood into it in not
conscious mind isn't deciding,

1105
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,113
so we're.
We are continual evidence of our own 

1106
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:13,170
unconscious activity.
But for me,

1107
00:56:13,171 --> 00:56:14,004
the idea of these narratives and this 
idea of external phenomena being 

1108
00:56:17,101 --> 00:56:20,970
experienced not via the material world 
or the central world,

1109
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:25,050
but via some kind of other tellier 
journey.

1110
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:26,223
Is that the right word?
Some other teleology like there is 

1111
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:32,950
momentum and receipt of data without 
going through the material world.

1112
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,030
I liked the sounds of that very,
very much because that seems like,

1113
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,470
you know,
like people say,

1114
00:56:38,471 --> 00:56:39,304
the reason the world's not changing is 
because of a lack of vision because no 

1115
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:42,334
one's got a better idea.
You know that we live in a political 

1116
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:45,004
age,
risk forms of management and shift of a 

1117
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:47,284
percent here or there,
but the things that are interesting in 

1118
00:56:49,271 --> 00:56:50,104
politics or about kindness and love and 
compassion and oneness and socialism is 

1119
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:54,310
just,
we're all one.

1120
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:58,180
We should look after each other and I 
suppose capitalism is just do the bloody

1121
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:02,230
best jacare where water got so like the 
idea that there could be new data,

1122
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:04,990
new information and empirical.
So that's what I think is important that

1123
00:57:04,991 --> 00:57:06,880
you're building material,
mechanical,

1124
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:07,863
empirical bridges because the idea that 
there is another vision within each of 

1125
00:57:11,981 --> 00:57:13,330
us,
another way of being,

1126
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:15,940
another version of yourself waiting to 
be realized.

1127
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,800
That's pretty exciting,
isn't it?

1128
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,413
Anything else?
If you've got anything else for me and 

1129
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:21,563
you have stories of stuff you've seen.
What about when Terence Mckenna is 

1130
00:57:23,531 --> 00:57:24,364
saying that he's seeing and like,
I like this idea about like some of the 

1131
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:29,710
things I heard two things on youtube I 
liked.

1132
00:57:29,711 --> 00:57:32,530
One was a Peruvian Shaman who like,
uh,

1133
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,450
you know,
obviously I've worked with plants in his

1134
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,870
capacity as a shaman being given dmt in 
clinical conditions.

1135
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,150
And he described exactly as you did that
like,

1136
00:57:40,151 --> 00:57:41,530
you know,
bodily sensation,

1137
00:57:41,531 --> 00:57:45,550
the sensation of fort speeding up.
Then the idea then thought stopping then

1138
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:47,860
this sort of personal sense of death of 
like,

1139
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:49,510
Oh my God,
they've ruined the,

1140
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,550
messed up the dosage,
I'm gonna die.

1141
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,593
And then realizing like that,
that's in fact personal death or death 

1142
00:57:54,731 --> 00:57:55,564
of the ego.
And then sort of encountering other 

1143
00:57:57,131 --> 00:57:58,570
entities.
I love that.

1144
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:01,390
I love the sound of that to me.
Absolutely.

1145
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,430
Bloody terrific.
One of the things he talked about is the

1146
00:58:03,431 --> 00:58:06,550
loss of time that he said that on his 
way back from the experience,

1147
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:07,384
if it goes off,
probably been gone for thousands of 

1148
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:09,603
years.
Hope there's some of my descendants 

1149
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:14,020
alive came back and he sort of said to 
the conditions or anyone alive and.

1150
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,270
Well yeah,
everyone's been gone 10 minutes mate.

1151
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,900
So like a dmt experience is what,
like this is 10 minutes or something.

1152
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,253
Yeah,
there's actually much less intense but 

1153
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,200
intense Buddhist like five minutes or 
even three,

1154
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:30,843
five minutes.
You are in a realm where sort of the 

1155
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:32,824
rules of the material world and the 
physical world seemed to abate and you 

1156
00:58:36,161 --> 00:58:38,710
experience things that are beyond your 
own understanding,

1157
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:41,890
beyond your own limitations of 
consciousness.

1158
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,660
One of the things I liked that Terence 
Mckenna said,

1159
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,790
if,
uh,

1160
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:47,250
if you,
if those were to land on the White House

1161
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:48,083
South Lawn,
it will be less impressive than what's 

1162
00:58:50,021 --> 00:58:52,090
happened happened in your own 
consciousness.

1163
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,060
Your own consciousness on dmt reveals to
you.

1164
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,073
But everything.
We understand the limitations and 

1165
00:58:57,011 --> 00:58:59,320
prohibitions as the material and 
physical world are,

1166
00:58:59,321 --> 00:59:04,321
but one frequency of being but one modem
of reality within us all.

1167
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:06,850
There's this sort of different 
potentiality.

1168
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:12,070
An interesting interesting.
We don't have,

1169
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:18,060
I don't have a Bunsen burner or the 
beaker full of alkaline think.

1170
00:59:18,411 --> 00:59:19,244
It's interesting.
It's like this break down enough to 

1171
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,130
where you're seeing the world.
I mean this

1172
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,670
is a really interesting thing and you 
mentioned that at some point.

1173
00:59:25,671 --> 00:59:26,504
I mean this idea of transitioning into 
another mode of being can be very 

1174
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:30,524
healing in itself as well.
And I think this is something that's 

1175
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:36,500
really striking about the experience and
why,

1176
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:39,350
you know,
people build this very intense narrative

1177
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:40,250
around them as well.

1178
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,930
Yeah.
You know,

1179
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:44,870
you could tell already that,
um,

1180
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,810
we've got a slight bias,
or at least speaking for myself,

1181
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:50,070
I have the,
you know,

1182
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:50,963
the,
it even though it might feel like you 

1183
00:59:52,531 --> 00:59:55,920
transcend the physical and material,
uh,

1184
00:59:56,490 --> 01:00:00,330
I'm not sure what to do because there's 
no real evidence for that.

1185
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:03,120
And what is the physical material in 
these terms,

1186
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,040
you know,
what would it mean to transcend it?

1187
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:08,310
Maybe it's just the experience of 
totality that the idea,

1188
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:09,144
even the paradigm or the template that 
suggests material and transcendence of 

1189
01:00:13,411 --> 01:00:16,980
material,
is it materialistic or a limited idea?

1190
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:22,220
I suppose psychologically things have a 
psychological reality that in a way,

1191
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,060
um,
you know,

1192
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,750
or a different way of looking and 
understanding things.

1193
01:00:27,751 --> 01:00:30,150
Then then looking at the biology and 
know,

1194
01:00:30,151 --> 01:00:33,750
looking at the biology is a,
is an objective perspective and you look

1195
01:00:33,751 --> 01:00:34,584
at,
yeah.

1196
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:36,010
Whereas,
you know,

1197
01:00:36,011 --> 01:00:36,844
this other perspective of feeling of 
experiences inherently subjective and 

1198
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:41,450
it's hard.

1199
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:44,870
It is hard to reconcile those things.
So they're,

1200
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,713
in a way,
there is a sort of started to get a bit 

1201
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:50,670
philosophical with terms,
but like an inevitable journalism,

1202
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:53,700
you know,
that there is a psychological reality to

1203
01:00:53,701 --> 01:00:54,534
these experiences that you can't,
and patsy shouldn't try and explain a 

1204
01:00:58,011 --> 01:00:58,844
way with biology,
but you can let them both sit next to 

1205
01:01:02,011 --> 01:01:04,200
each other and say when I,
you know,

1206
01:01:04,201 --> 01:01:08,190
I do know what maps onto that feeling 
and that experience,

1207
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,293
there's not,
you know,

1208
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,600
and then you know it and if you want to 
try and,

1209
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:13,463
you know,
shatter a present sort of paradigms in 

1210
01:01:18,961 --> 01:01:20,150
science and,
and,

1211
01:01:20,151 --> 01:01:20,984
and you have this belief hypothesis that
actually these breakthroughs into 

1212
01:01:25,141 --> 01:01:29,070
another realm are actually literally 
true and that you know,

1213
01:01:29,071 --> 01:01:31,140
that there are other dimensions and such
like,

1214
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,650
then you've got a hypothesis and you can
go ahead and try and test it.

1215
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,000
You know,
we haven't,

1216
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,990
we haven't done that yet.

1217
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:42,350
Leave something in there and I bring 
something back from it.

1218
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:45,190
Um,
yes,

1219
01:01:45,191 --> 01:01:49,280
that's interesting what I'm talking a 
lot.

1220
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:52,590
We mentioned at the beginning the idea 
of a collective unconscious.

1221
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:56,860
One of the,
perhaps the defining union idea is there

1222
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:57,833
in the work that you've done with 
psychedelics over your professional 

1223
01:02:00,911 --> 01:02:01,744
lifetime,
is there an interesting consistency 

1224
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:08,950
across substances and of course 
experiences that suggest that there is a

1225
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:11,710
commonality to the conscious experience 
of people using these

1226
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:14,420
substances?
Wow.

1227
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,980
Um,
yes,

1228
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:22,260
but I'm,
and I guess one unifying,

1229
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,250
uh,
um,

1230
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:26,220
aspect of the experience is this feeling
of,

1231
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,800
Oh my God,
you know,

1232
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:31,110
myself was a construction,
you know,

1233
01:02:31,111 --> 01:02:31,944
that it,
that it was built up that it's not 

1234
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,820
absolutely real.
You know,

1235
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:37,823
I think that's one thing that's,
that's common to everyone and then when 

1236
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:46,170
that is transcended another common 
experiences that,

1237
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,380
um,
the role,

1238
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:51,990
wow.
No one wants that drug.

1239
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,530
The,
Oh,

1240
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:55,630
we're all one drug.
You better go to work.

1241
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:58,270
I'm afraid I'm not going to pay your 
mortgage.

1242
01:02:58,271 --> 01:03:01,900
Why you need to achieve more.
For what reason?

1243
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:04,870
I mean,
it certainly presents a lot of questions

1244
01:03:04,871 --> 01:03:09,610
that might be challenging to keeping a 
population behaving in a certain way.

1245
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,810
Is it very,
very.

1246
01:03:10,811 --> 01:03:14,180
There's a lot of interesting stories and
I don't think they're a ttl,

1247
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,640
uh,
under the skin.

1248
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:16,773
A name of this show has ever been more 
pertinent because a subcutaneous glance 

1249
01:03:21,071 --> 01:03:24,640
at these inner world suggests the 
potential for huge,

1250
01:03:24,641 --> 01:03:28,300
huge change.
I'm so grateful to both of you,

1251
01:03:28,301 --> 01:03:30,940
Robin and Chris for coming in and 
explaining,

1252
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:32,123
albeit in some cases tentatively,
but importantly very professionally and 

1253
01:03:34,631 --> 01:03:36,940
I think still within the confines of 
academia,

1254
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:37,923
something that sounds like a wonderful,
wonderful mystery and when the Great 

1255
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:45,100
Brian Cox talks about physics is the 
mystery and the wonder and the glory and

1256
01:03:45,101 --> 01:03:45,934
our attempts to understand and explain 
it this fascinating in all forms of 

1257
01:03:48,581 --> 01:03:49,414
discipline,
but when it comes to consciousness 

1258
01:03:50,471 --> 01:03:52,840
itself,
not just one more phenomena,

1259
01:03:52,841 --> 01:03:55,570
but the crucible of all phenomena is 
deeply,

1260
01:03:55,571 --> 01:03:56,800
deeply fascinating.

1261
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,490
So thank you both of you very much.
Been a pleasure.

1262
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,880
Really cool.
Really cool.

1263
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:02,523
Who's got a syringe that you understand 
you've been listened to under the skin 

1264
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:09,424
with Russell brand is.
It's not ironically with all sincerity 

1265
01:04:12,491 --> 01:04:13,324
sponsored by my book recovery,
a new way of looking at addiction and 

1266
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:17,763
new way of looking at consciousness,
a new way of managing your own feelings 

1267
01:04:20,021 --> 01:04:21,760
and your own life.
Go Russell brand.com.

1268
01:04:21,761 --> 01:04:23,740
We've had the website redesigned,
looks really good,

1269
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:26,020
and all of the episodes are under the 
skin on.

1270
01:04:26,021 --> 01:04:29,260
They're completely free for you,
as is the truth,

1271
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:32,050
completely free for you,
completely free.

1272
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,120
There's the message on the skin.
Thank you.
