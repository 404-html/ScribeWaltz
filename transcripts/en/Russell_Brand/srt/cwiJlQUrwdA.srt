00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,580
Sam harris.
He's a writer,

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,650
neuroscientist,
philosopher and host of the podcast,

3
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:05,484
waking up with Sam Harris.
He's written five New York Times 

4
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:08,694
bestsellers covering a range of topics 
from neuroscience and religion to 

5
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:15,060
violence and human reasoning.
These include the end of faith letter to

6
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:18,150
a Christian nation,
free will and the moral landscape.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,283
He's the Co founder and Chief Executive 
of Project Reason and nonprofit 

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,093
organization that promotes science and 
secularism and as argued that science 

9
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:30,000
can determine moral values.
He's previously studied both eastern and

10
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,700
Western religious traditions including 
Buddhism,

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,920
Hinduism,
making several trips to India and Nepal.

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,830
He is now a proponent of secular 
meditation practices.

13
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:38,664
He's a vegetarian practices Brazilian 
Jujitsu and is married with two 

14
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:43,320
daughters and has a correction.

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,363
I'm going to have to recant on the 
vegetarian there a can in the 

16
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:48,450
vegetarianism for the moment.
I unfortunately,

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,610
it's exactly like a pasta.
Well,

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,860
welcome.
Thank you.

19
00:00:55,861 --> 00:01:00,450
Regardless of the embracing the Avatar 
that I'm trailing vine.

20
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,080
Um,
thanks for coming on.

22
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:06,330
I've talked to you for such a long time.
Oh yeah.

23
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,253
And I've heard from so many of our 
mutual audience members that we should 

24
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:11,214
be getting together.
So,

25
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,740
because I suppose in the works for a 
long time,

26
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,000
yeah,
yeah.

27
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:15,834
We exist in that sort of a,
in the sonic boom created by Joe Rogan 

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,900
perhaps.
Yeah.

29
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,470
Maybe.
How'd you want Joe Rogan?

30
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:26,250
I listened to waking up and I've heard a
bunch of your stuff.

31
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:27,780
I saw you on Joe Rogan as well.
So yeah,

32
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:31,140
Joe Joe is the,
the 800 pound gorilla of podcasters.

33
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,700
Casey is,
everyone knows.

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,870
Yeah,
he's the

35
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,380
very much that we are all orbiting Joe 
Rogan let's face yet.

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,630
And like,
God,

37
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:41,730
there's so much stuff I want to ask you 
about,

38
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,670
but you know,
because there's loads of things we agree

39
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:45,504
on loads,
but there are some pretty distinct 

40
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:49,890
things that I imagine we disagree on.
And I suppose these will be some of the,

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,960
some interesting things to,
to,

42
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:54,150
um,
to analyze.

43
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,270
Um,
but just to start us off,

44
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,940
um,
I suppose,

45
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,770
tell us a little bit about that.
The,

46
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:07,771
the fusion of neuroscience,
philosophy and atheism and the,

47
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,091
the,
the,

48
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:09,924
it's become sort of the,
the defining of people's perception of 

49
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,580
you,
but there's a sort of a,

50
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:17,730
I suppose a neurological,
a underwriting for your sort of personal

51
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:20,280
perspective of atheism and how you fit 
in,

52
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,114
what you've learned in this sort of like
the 10 years since you've come to 

53
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,200
prominence and how your positions 
perhaps evolved.

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,061
Yeah.
Well,

55
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:26,894
the,
the atheism connection is probably just 

56
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:31,034
an accident of history more than 
anything because it really is what 

57
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,310
happened to my intellectual life right 
after September 11th.

58
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,020
So I was doing my neuroscience phd,
I had a background in philosophy.

59
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:42,854
I was,
I went into neuroscience very much with 

60
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:46,520
the interest of a philosopher.
I was,

61
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,850
I was always interested in understanding
the human mind at a,

62
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,780
uh,
a high,

63
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:54,360
a high,
a level that really about,

64
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,360
would only be doing work in,
in people.

65
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:57,194
And I'm not,
I wasn't ever thinking of curing 

66
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:00,064
diseases.
And it was all about just understanding 

67
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,960
human subjectivity and consciousness and
morality and,

68
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,180
uh,
human reason.

69
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:08,590
The,
these were the kinds of,

70
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,603
uh,
higher level mental attributes that 

71
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:15,040
interested in me.
And so I was doing my,

72
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,830
I was in the middle of my phd.
I had done my coursework,

73
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,130
I was getting into neuro imaging work on
belief.

74
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,310
I was studying the difference between 
belief and disbelief and uncertainty.

75
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,460
And then September 11th happened and I 
had,

76
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,520
I had a background in meditation.
I had a background in explicitly,

77
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,253
uh,
trying to cash out rather ancient 

78
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:40,100
spiritual concerns,
um,

79
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,863
uh,
through whatever methodology was 

80
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:44,170
available.
So I had,

81
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,120
you know,
had taken psychedelics in my twenties.

82
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:48,640
I had spent about two years on silent 
retreat.

83
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,660
I was,
you know,

84
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,523
very connected to the experiential side 
of what people think they're only 

85
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,030
religion is good at.
Right.

86
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:00,000
But I was not a believer,
uh,

87
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,290
uh,
of,

88
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,340
of any sort.
I was,

89
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,420
um,
I was,

90
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,254
I was an atheist,
but I never thought of myself as an 

91
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:07,354
atheist.
I was totally unaware of atheism as an 

92
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:13,300
organized political movement.
I couldn't have told you who Madelyn,

93
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,500
Mario hair was.
I mean,

94
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:15,930
there's a famous atheist.
I,

95
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:16,764
you know,
I was aware of people like Richard 

96
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,870
Dawkins for their science,
but I was not someone who had read books

97
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:23,704
on atheism.

98
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,840
And so my first book,
the end of faith,

99
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:26,674
which,
which really was the really initiated 

100
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:30,154
this,
this publishing phenomenon that was 

101
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:32,800
called the new atheism.
I,

102
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,540
because then it was,
it was me and then Dawkins,

103
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,374
and then I came out with my second book 
and then Dan Dennett and Christopher 

104
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,330
Hitchens,
all of us had these books that came out.

105
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,763
Um,
I never even used the word atheism in 

106
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:45,380
the end of faith.
And it was,

107
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,820
it wasn't that I thought not to use it,
it just was not a word I used.

108
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,720
So I was just talking about the,
the conflict between reason and faith,

109
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,240
the con conflict between science and 
religion,

110
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,390
the,
the obvious untenable realty.

111
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:59,224
I mean that the actual proper horror of 
the fact that we have a world that has 

112
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:03,934
shattered into these separate religious 
communities and these separate and 

113
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:11,821
incommensurable worldviews based on an 
adherence to these ancient books.

114
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,080
Uh,
and that strikes me as,

115
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,473
and then as it struck me then,
and it strikes me now as just as 

116
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:18,814
perverse as people blowing themselves up
over rival interpretations of 

117
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:23,080
Shakespeare.
And I mean,

118
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:27,190
just imagine there was some hamlet cult 
versus some king lear cult,

119
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,083
right?
And people are willing to die for these 

120
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:31,150
differences.
Those cults exists.

121
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,370
But that,
that's the world we're living in.

122
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,260
I mean,
our world is just that absurd.

123
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:39,190
And so I reacted to all of this in the 
aftermath of September 11th,

124
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,713
uh,
without ever defining myself in my own 

125
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,540
mind as someone who was now shilling for
atheism.

126
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,020
But then I got inducted into this,
into the conversation about atheism.

127
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:51,040
So it,
it's,

128
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,070
it's somewhat ironic that atheist is one
of the first words that in my bio,

129
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,120
but it's not,
it's not an

130
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,673
no.
Was retrospectively applied or though 

131
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:02,284
your [inaudible] you say you were kind 
of the insight in incident of your 

132
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:06,844
public life.
Your life is a public in a lecturer was 

133
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:10,810
nine 11,
which you,

134
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,980
uh,
rigidly defined as a,

135
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,993
I said,
I've suppose judging from what you've 

136
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:21,640
just said as a,
a religious event primarily or an act of

137
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,920
religious violence.

138
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,471
Oh yeah.
Well it was,

139
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,304
it was clearly that you might want to 
talk about other variables that could 

140
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,850
explain it or that could of could of,
uh,

141
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,100
uh,
other motives that,

142
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,980
that people might have.
You know,

143
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,530
you might want to talk about politics or
economics or,

144
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,260
or,
um,

145
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,930
US foreign policy with a legacy of 
colonialism.

146
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:45,764
But I think it is absolutely clear that 
while those variables account for some 

147
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,960
of them,
the misbehavior in our world,

148
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,153
there are still people who get up in the
morning with 100% of their motivation 

149
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,280
being a religious expectation of an 
afterlife.

150
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,143
I mean,
these people exist.

151
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,253
I can just find you these people who 
have none of the other variables that 

152
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:13,130
people would want to use to explain.
And the terrestrial variables,

153
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,330
economics,
politics,

154
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,130
there are people who have never suffered
any economic insecurity who devote their

155
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:19,964
life to Jihad.
There are people who drop out of the 

156
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,493
London School of economics who are 
British citizens so that they can go 

157
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,480
fight with Isis.
So,

158
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,220
and it's,

159
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,220
what does that to you imply the toxicity
of religious ideology?

160
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,081
Well,
it's,

161
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:40,770
it's the power of belief.
It's not even,

162
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,380
it's not even,
it's not even purely toxic.

163
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:43,961
I mean,
this is the,

164
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:48,961
the horrible paradox here.
I think the experience of people even in

165
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:52,350
the,
even in the most extreme,

166
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,130
and we might want to say psychopathic 
cults,

167
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,360
right?
Something like Isis.

168
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,130
The experience by and large is not of 
being a psychopath.

169
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,380
It's a,
it's not like Isis.

170
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,540
And again,
now we're sort of now focusing on,

171
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,733
obviously my criticism of religion is 
much wider than focusing on 

172
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:12,390
fundamentalist Islam.
But to take this case,

173
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,200
many people think that Isis was acting 
like a bug light for the world.

174
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:19,404
Psychopaths that only psychopaths would 
go over there and behave this badly and 

175
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,953
then you,
what you're talking about is bad people 

176
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,193
who would behave badly anyway.
These are people who were going to rape 

177
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:33,680
and kill any way and they just found an 
excuse or a,

178
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:37,290
or a pretext by which to do it under the
ages of religion.

179
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,150
That's just not true.
I mean,

180
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:42,340
we just know enough about the bios of 
these people that it's,

181
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,263
and you would never say that of someone 
who was observing some other religious 

182
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:53,511
behavior slavishly under,
under some doctrines.

183
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:54,700
He wouldn't say that,
you know,

184
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,220
that you wouldn't explain the behavior 
of people at the mass,

185
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,080
the Catholic mass,
you know,

186
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,990
where they line up to eat a cracker.
You wouldn't say,

187
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:05,260
well this is just,
you know,

188
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,233
politically motivated,
crack reading behavior of these people 

189
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,250
would find pretext,
eat crackers on Sundays anyway.

190
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,211
You know,
they would,

191
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:13,044
they would,
they would ritualize their cracker 

192
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:15,660
eating behavior for some other reason.
No,

193
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:19,110
no.
They have a belief that explains exactly

194
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:21,780
what they're doing with this cracker.
And they'll tell you,

195
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:22,111
and,
and,

196
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:23,160
and it's,
it's just not,

197
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:23,660
and it's,
it's,

198
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,190
it's a doctrine that they're following.
And if a doctor,

199
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,260
if the doctor and said,
eat two crackers,

200
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:29,220
they'd be in two crackers.

201
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,360
Sure.
But like I personally,

202
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:33,490
and presumably you would agree with 
this,

203
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,653
the Catholic mass is serving a 
particular function as all ritual and 

204
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:44,071
ceremonies and the literalness if the 
cracker is secondary to it's evident,

205
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,760
perfunctory role,
uh,

206
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,110
as I,
uh,

207
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,003
a place for social cohesion,
acknowledgement of mortality and the 

208
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:55,924
potential for the human soul or the 
human essence to aspire to something 

209
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,473
beyond the carnal blood and body drives.
If we take Christ from a more 

210
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:10,111
theological as opposed to sort of a,
in a sort of reductive simplistic.

211
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:15,670
And I think for me personally,
spiritually useless perspective as,

212
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:16,504
as like the metaphor of Christ being 
that the potential for transcendence 

213
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,690
beyond the flesh individual to the 
enlightened male that Oh,

214
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,560
the enlightened being I suppose,
uh,

215
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,623
then the sort of the mass for me is an 
opportunity to ceremoniously 

216
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:34,500
acknowledged that meaning.
So like I,

217
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,820
I would look at a mass and go,
oh,

218
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:39,080
this ain't about literally in crackers 
and like,

219
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,933
and in even the metaphor as explicitly 
stated in the scriptural terms of that 

220
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,630
denomination,
there's more that even that is limited.

221
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,730
I would say that people drive to do that
as,

222
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,960
as,
as Mariam is Mariam.

223
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,421
So you're,
you're,

224
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:55,890
you're flipping the logic of what I'm 
saying.

225
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:59,550
So I'm saying that the thing that 
explains the actual ritual,

226
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,370
the cracker eating is the doctrine,
right?

227
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,480
If the doctrine,
we're different,

228
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,240
if the doctrine where if Jesus had said,
well,

229
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:08,280
this bread is,
it has nothing to do with my body.

230
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,620
So it doesn't matter what you do at the 
mass,

231
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,780
right?
Don't eat anything right to eat anything

232
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:15,990
is to pollute your body.
You should just be thinking about me,

233
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,400
right?
If that was the doctrine,

234
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,860
there would be no cracker eating ritual,
right?

235
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:21,090
So that,
so the doctrine is,

236
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:21,601
it says,
I mean,

237
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:24,420
it's a bizarre act of,
of,

238
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,960
you know,
human sacrifice and cannibalism at the,

239
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:27,794
at the bottom of it,
which doesn't make a hell of a lot of 

240
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:29,690
sense.

241
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,523
But if you look at the roots of 
agricultural diety worship and the 

242
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:35,084
relationship between the known and the 
unknown and the necessity to have 

243
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,630
relationship with plants or season,
it doesn't,

244
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:40,464
it doesn't

245
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,700
gonna be eating his body like,
like,

246
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,650
like they wouldn't the,
the people

247
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,520
except as a metaphor for union.
Yeah.

248
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:48,360
But in oneness.

249
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,020
Yeah.
Except it's not taught.

250
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:53,740
It's not preached as a metaphor and the 
doctrine's not metaphorical.

251
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,193
I will grant you that many,
many people aren't thinking about it 

252
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:57,964
literally now.
But that's just to say they've lost 

253
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,420
their faith in the actual doctrine of 
the,

254
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,383
and I think that's important.
And also I think we have to look beyond 

255
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:06,050
rationalism.
I think when we're dealing,

256
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,893
you know,
you are a man who is deeply interested 

257
00:12:08,001 --> 00:12:09,830
in mysticism and spirituality in 
anything.

258
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:13,490
Once it's on the plane of the corporal 
and the rational,

259
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,020
then it to evaluate the symbols purely,
rationally,

260
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:21,950
they're always going to be sort of kind 
of left wanting because yeah,

261
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,793
the in a wafer or drinking some wine.
But if you have a relationship with the 

262
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:27,870
wholeness,

263
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,180
I would be slow to conclude that I 
think,

264
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:35,690
I don't think you have to be irrational 
to use these tools

265
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,320
or beyond rational,
not the rational,

266
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:40,450
not like a necessarily less than 
rational,

267
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,740
possibly more than that.

268
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,930
Clearly more than form any rational 
understanding of the universe.

269
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,640
There's more to life than that.
I mean there's,

270
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,320
there's,
there's fun,

271
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,000
there's love,
there's beauty,

272
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:53,580
there's,
there's uh,

273
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,450
there's more that we want out from life 
than simply not being wrong.

274
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,523
Right?
So I'm not saying that that reason is 

275
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,220
everything,
but the question is,

276
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,790
do you ever have to be irrational to go 
beyond merely conceptually understanding

277
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,710
the world?
Do you ever have to lie to yourself?

278
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,573
Do you ever ever have to have to lie to 
others or believe the lies of others to 

279
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,010
go beat,
go into these other areas that,

280
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,873
that no one would know.
But most people are living as though 

281
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:22,564
absolutely you do that because religion 
is just the most profligate example of 

282
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:29,500
lying that,
that any and self deception.

283
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,950
We mentioned it.
Politics is it,

284
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:32,030
I mean it's

285
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,600
every bit as bad except then it just,
it pauses an afterlife where it gets all

286
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:37,350
cashed out

287
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,420
except of course,
you know,

288
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:43,140
like again to return to the point about 
nine 11 new or particularly induction.

289
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:43,974
Sure.
Wittingly or otherwise I into what's 

290
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:51,180
being come known as the new atheistic 
movement.

291
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,560
That for me,
what,

292
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,590
this is a question I suppose if that 
particular event taken in isolation,

293
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,110
is it like,
you know,

294
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:04,110
Bob Barry can horrific and dreadfully 
cinematic and totemic.

295
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,493
Uh,
but definitely taking place within a 

296
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:13,800
historical context.
For me,

297
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:17,040
they're very variables that you,
fleetingly mentioned economics,

298
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,980
colonialism,
these like how do we delineate,

299
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:20,814
how do we sort of,
where are these imaginary lines drawn 

300
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,790
between this is religious violence,
this is political violence.

301
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,910
This is acceptable violence to who draws
those lines.

302
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,580
Also,

303
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,580
they can be very easily drawn when you,
when you take the case of any individual

304
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:37,660
and his or her motives

305
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,710
individuals,
yeah,

306
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,980
we have to resort to individualism as 
opposed to cultural,

307
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,963
national movements.
You have to take that individual is 

308
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,910
crazy.
But that state and that state action,

309
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,100
I would first say that very few of these
people are crazy.

310
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,133
So let me just break this down a little 
bit because there are many different 

311
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,130
types of violence and so there,
there are,

312
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,350
there are crazy people who are just 
crazy in,

313
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:03,380
in the,
in the,

314
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,810
uh,
the more clinical sense of that term,

315
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:06,644
which is,
which is to say they're suffering some 

316
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:08,750
thought disorder.
They're,

317
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:09,610
they're,
they're,

318
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:10,444
they're,
they're suffering from some kind of 

319
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,630
delusion,
right?

320
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,470
So,
you know,

321
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,750
many of the people that are 
schizophrenia,

322
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,530
but,
but you know,

323
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,110
there are probably other ways we want 
to,

324
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:20,630
um,
class a thought disorder here,

325
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:22,280
but they're not,
they're not rational.

326
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,800
They don't have rational goals.
They're hearing voices.

327
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:26,170
They think they're talking to the,
you know,

328
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,013
the,
the son of Sam thought his dog was 

329
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,570
telling him to kill people.

330
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,160
Next door's dog at all.
Right.

331
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:33,040
Okay.
Yeah,

332
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,440
we're still,
yes,

333
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:36,600
exactly.
Pay attention to your own dark,

334
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,320
rough night.
Um,

335
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:45,140
so yes,
and different from everyone else.

336
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,370
People who are mentally ill are not 
dangerous.

337
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:51,340
But there are some people who are 
mentally ill who are right now,

338
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:56,700
there are people who do horrific things 
for no ideological motive,

339
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,120
no rational animus,
but purely because they're crazy,

340
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,250
right?
So you take like every one example would

341
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:08,251
be probably this Guy Adam Lanza who went
into the school in Newtown and killed 20

342
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:11,920
some odd children and,
and half a dozen teachers,

343
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:13,840
right?
I think 26 people were gunned down.

344
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,670
He,
I don't know what,

345
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:16,504
I don't know if anyone gave a diagnosis.
I mean he was probably almost certainly 

346
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:22,210
on the autistic spectrum,
but he had something else going on,

347
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,313
but he didn't,
he wasn't a white supremacist who had 

348
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:27,910
some ideology who was,
who was acting out in this way.

349
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,360
He wasn't a jihadist who thought he was 
going to get into paradise.

350
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:32,560
Right?
So,

351
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,653
uh,
and there are many other examples of 

352
00:16:35,531 --> 00:16:37,210
mass shootings like that.

353
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,520
Jared lauffner was a guy like that.
You know who,

354
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:40,770
um,
uh,

355
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,673
whereas you,
if you're going to talk to this person 

356
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:43,414
and find out why he did it,
nothing is going to make sense right 

357
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,490
now.
That is very different.

358
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,983
And yet,
so that we could talk about the same 

359
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:55,390
superficial crime of going in and 
killing children in a school,

360
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,770
right?
Uh,

361
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,410
there's that version of it.
Then there's the,

362
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,380
uh,
really angry,

363
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,680
uh,
and I would argue,

364
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,810
psychopathic,
sadistic,

365
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,890
eat classically evil person who just 
wants to kill kids,

366
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,753
right?
Who just gets off on all of the misery 

367
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,410
he's going to create as a result of this
crime.

368
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,750
Now this person is not suffering a 
thought disorder.

369
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,180
Now we,
if we knew more about the brain,

370
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,580
I think in the end we would,
we would be happy to say,

371
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:25,414
well,
there's still something wrong with this 

372
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:26,471
guy's brain.
I mean,

373
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:29,980
we're human evil is a species of 
neurological disorder,

374
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,203
but we don't understand it yet.
And so now where it's tempting just to 

375
00:17:33,191 --> 00:17:33,521
say,
well,

376
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:34,630
these people are evil,
right?

377
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,600
It's a very different kind of person 
from the first person.

378
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,620
Um,
and yeah,

379
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:40,454
there's probably into the boundary 
between those people are or can be kind 

380
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,354
of fluid,
but,

381
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,430
but you know,
these are different types of people.

382
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:46,800
No,
but

383
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,990
get to the worst case.
The worst case is there are,

384
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,603
who are as good,
whoever are moral and as ethical and as 

385
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,460
committed to the wellbeing of themselves
and others as you and I are,

386
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,073
who still go in and shoot up schools and
kill everybody and hope to die in the 

387
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:08,090
process because they think they can get 
into paradise that way and get into p.

388
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,953
So when,
when members of the Taliban went into a 

389
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:15,760
school in Pakistan and killed,
I think it was 137 kids and,

390
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,360
and,
and burn their teacher alive in front of

391
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:19,500
them.
Uh,

392
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,730
you have to ask yourself,
what do you think?

393
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,740
You know,
all members of the Taliban who endorsed,

394
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:25,710
who did this and then all of those and 
the Taliban who endorsed this,

395
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,650
we're all just psychopaths or mentally 
ill.

396
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,731
No,
no.

397
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:32,190
If you listen to what they're saying,
if you listen to what their,

398
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,083
where they believe,
if you read the texts that they think 

399
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:36,990
are the verbatim word of the creator of 
the universe,

400
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,363
it all falls into place.
This is perfectly rational behavior 

401
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:41,964
given the requisite beliefs.
And that is what is so horrible about 

402
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,880
this kind of dogmatism.

403
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,723
Even that process or that sort of 
extreme example of the execution of 

404
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:49,814
children in schools.
You base of an elective reading of even 

405
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:55,100
that particular doctorate and it'd be 
particular like passages you go,

406
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:57,620
oh is the passage where the sort of not 
so much.

407
00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:58,454
Unfortunately there's loads of stuff 
that's like live a peaceful life of 

408
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,460
devotion.
[inaudible] have you read the Quran?

409
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,090
Have you read the Quran cover to cover 
saw bloody,

410
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,933
we're laughing.
There's mainly got through these notes 

411
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,760
for this interview,
so I'm doing this thing on the flight.

412
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,633
You can,
you can do it at the point it's a short 

413
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:14,534
book or like my general feeling is that 
the Quran holy is like most religious 

414
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:21,404
scripture.
The intention is to create a social 

415
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:27,740
environment where people are benevolent 
and cohesive,

416
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,603
which ultimately became a tool for 
social control as a result of the way 

417
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:33,140
the power structures,
but there's more than that.

418
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,020
There's,
there's likely the religion in politics,

419
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,250
but I don't know.
I think,

420
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:38,084
again,
I wouldn't deliberately misread the 

421
00:19:39,441 --> 00:19:40,340
metaphor for,
for me,

422
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,680
life after death,
and this is a person who spent two years

423
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,030
in a silent matree,
Gavi,

424
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,903
you with Dick.
This is that beyond the life that is 

425
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:47,924
determined by primal desires and 
biographical wants and your imagination 

426
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:53,684
of yourself.
There is a life after the death of that 

427
00:19:56,991 --> 00:19:57,824
individual.
After that individual dies and you 

428
00:19:59,421 --> 00:20:03,020
recognize that the temporal can never 
provide fulfillment,

429
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,070
you gain access to a sort of a second 
life and after life,

430
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:10,370
the Kingdom of Heaven is spread upon the
earth and man sees it,

431
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:13,910
not the Kingdom of Heaven,
the life after the death of your ego.

432
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,230
So Sam,
yes,

433
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,470
I would say I would like if it's not 
talking about that,

434
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,480
I don't know what it's talking about and
what the value of that would be as a,

435
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:24,810
as a,
as a manual for being,

436
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,270
for being human.
There's so much,

437
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:26,810
mate,
let me,

438
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,643
hold on a sec.
We've got go for you did a big 

439
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:32,990
classification system of the degrees of 
who we've got to do the schools.

440
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:33,561
Okay.
What we'll do.

441
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:35,510
Then do your flag and then we're going 
back to the school.

442
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,590
You want to acknowledge that.
However,

443
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,513
whatever

444
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,590
personal reading breathing

445
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,423
is,
most people most of the time think that 

446
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:47,530
the afterlife is a literal place.
You go after die.

447
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:49,660
That consciousness survives the death of
the body.

448
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,250
And in the Judeo Christian tradition,
especially the Christian,

449
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,320
the Christian and the and the,
the Islamic tradition,

450
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,840
it really matters whether you believe 
the right thing or not.

451
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,703
I mean,
in fact this life doesn't matter at all 

452
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:03,400
and that's what's so corrosive about 
this.

453
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,093
But like in it,
and actually look at some of the 

454
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:08,100
alternatives now we did,
we just,

455
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:08,934
their device to barometer of degrees if 
madness and the worst types of madness 

456
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:16,080
and the worst way to tobacco your kids 
murdered in a school by which particular

457
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:17,250
type of madman,
you know,

458
00:21:17,251 --> 00:21:18,720
but we should probably bring into the 
mix.

459
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,273
Not all men are like,
I don't mind kids killed in a school by 

460
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,183
for any ideology,
whether it's grounded in sort of 

461
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:33,111
rationalism and economics or whether 
it's a book that's a bit older and more,

462
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,530
I don't know,
esoterical colorful or imaginative,

463
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:39,150
I don't know sort of how to determine 
it.

464
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:39,984
But what I suppose what I suppose the 
heart of why I want to get to is whilst 

465
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:49,430
undoubtably religion has been used to 
justify violence from all types of Ang,

466
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,373
uh,
angles and in different historical 

467
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:57,570
moments and you know,
Buddhist violence in Burma and Christian

468
00:21:57,571 --> 00:21:59,340
violence in,
you know,

469
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,233
like in the Middle East or sit or 
secular violence underwritten by 

470
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,354
Christianity,
resourced entirely from Christiana in 

471
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:05,844
sort of Christian dualistic notions 
undertaken by far right Christian 

472
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,820
president and whatever.

473
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:12,983
Or you know,
sort of the more lucid livid and office 

474
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,210
and contemporaneous a far right is a 
extremist Islamic violence.

475
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,201
It's like,
well,

476
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:27,201
how do we see that as distinct from 
rational violence,

477
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:28,224
political violence,
particularly when that is far more 

478
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:31,980
potent palm,
far more widespread.

479
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,843
And it's,
I would say is the violence of the 

480
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:36,150
dominant culture.
What interests me,

481
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:41,151
Sam Harris is power and the powerful,
and for me I'm interested in who gets to

482
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:46,590
decide who the other is,
who gets to decide by what metric.

483
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,453
Rationalism and religion is evaluated.
And it seems to me that the kind of 

484
00:22:51,451 --> 00:22:52,284
violence that's focused on in a lot of 
your work is the violence of desperate 

485
00:22:55,921 --> 00:23:00,660
people.
Desperate possibly subjugated people.

486
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:03,210
And I would say to this,
I know that you don't do this,

487
00:23:03,211 --> 00:23:07,890
but I want you to educate me on this.
But to dismiss the colonial aspect,

488
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,170
the,
the sort of economic aspect,

489
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:12,960
the occupation of Middle Eastern 
countries and historical,

490
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,370
I mean if for me it seems like how,
how can you conduct that extraction?

491
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:19,860
How can you divorce those different 
types of violence?

492
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:22,110
They seem to me to be part of one 
narrative.

493
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,590
Well,
I can do it very simply because you have

494
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:25,424
exam just to dissect out the variable of
colonialism or oppression from the 

495
00:23:28,671 --> 00:23:30,260
outside.
Um,

496
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,970
you have examples of people who have 
been oppressed as,

497
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:34,963
as oppressed as any other people who 
don't resort to this kind of violence 

498
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:39,320
because they don't have the same belief 
structure.

499
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,460
Right?
So take that.

500
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,231
Here's a,
here's a,

501
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:44,840
an almost perfect scientific experiment.
You,

502
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,423
Palestinian Christians and Palestinian 
Muslims living in the same occupied 

503
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:52,334
territories right now,
who was blowing that well before the 

504
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:58,600
Israelis put up the wall who was blowing
themselves up in,

505
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,770
in pizza parlors and discotheques,
right?

506
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,090
It was 99.9%
Muslim,

507
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,680
right?
It was not Christian.

508
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,933
You have Coptic Christians in Egypt 
being murdered by their Muslim 

509
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:13,814
neighbors,
by suicide bombings who don't resort to 

510
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:19,430
their own suicide bombings in return.
Right?

511
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,200
It's the beliefs matter.

512
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,063
The details matter.
Why do you fetishize the or antagonism 

513
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,710
towards that particular type of 
violence?

514
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,471
Not,
it's not a,

515
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:32,000
it's not a fetish.
It's just violence exists in the context

516
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:35,570
of a far more potent opponents.
Violence.

517
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:35,941
No,
no,

518
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:36,201
no,
no,

519
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:37,034
no,
no.

520
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,120
Okay.
Like he can't,

521
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:39,770
we can't talk about Palestinian 
violence.

522
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,470
And for Christian person you might 
acknowledge saying no,

523
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:44,230
not talking about history.
No,

524
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,073
of course,
of course we can because we can because 

525
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:47,840
you can have sweet though.

526
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,453
Moral morning,
someone in Orange County will be 

527
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:56,430
converted to this belief system and want
to fight in the name of this cause.

528
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,280
And it's purely a matter of belief.
It's,

529
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,390
it's as much a matter of belief as you 
wanting to go on a diet or a learning to

530
00:25:03,391 --> 00:25:06,150
meditate.
Or maybe I'll go to Hawaii this year for

531
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,470
my vacation.
These are ideas.

532
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,131
But luckily,
you know,

533
00:25:11,131 --> 00:25:11,964
you and I,
we live in a sort of a secular society 

534
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:18,691
and our beliefs seldom come into 
opposition with the dominant philosophy.

535
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,490
And when it does there,
there are problems.

536
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,860
W what worries me?
So I was really,

537
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:27,611
oh,
so that might be here.

538
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:28,444
My background concerns,
I think ideas are the most powerful 

539
00:25:30,971 --> 00:25:34,840
things we've got right?
Ideas are the operating system for human

540
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:35,674
life and human culture.
And if we fail to build a civilization 

541
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:40,504
that works,
it will be because of the failure of 

542
00:25:42,221 --> 00:25:43,054
ideas or our failure to communicate good
ideas to one another in such a way 

543
00:25:45,941 --> 00:25:46,960
that's persuasive.
So,

544
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,520
so,
I mean,

545
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,700
how do you get 7 billion strangers to 
peacefully collaborate with one another?

546
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,013
It is a matter of conversation that 
ultimately gets people to converge on 

547
00:25:57,251 --> 00:26:00,760
common projects and common values.
And so all we have is conversation.

548
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,420
And when conversation fails,
all we have is violence,

549
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:04,970
right?
There's,

550
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,650
there's really just two modes,
conversation in violence and what you're

551
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,140
talking about when you're talking about 
power and it's misuses,

552
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,410
you're talking about state violence or,
or state coercion,

553
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,510
uh,
that you deem to be illegitimate.

554
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,210
Now I'll grant you.
But if we,

555
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,350
if we took a list of all of these cases,
you know,

556
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:26,500
CIA run coups and other countries where,
you know,

557
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,390
you and I may just check the same box.
It's like,

558
00:26:28,391 --> 00:26:29,224
well that looks legitimate or that,
that had consequences that could have 

559
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:32,284
easily been foreseen.
Lots of people suffered and died there 

560
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:37,120
that shouldn't have the objectives.
All of it.

561
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:37,780
Yes.
And,

562
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,950
and,
um,

563
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,340
so,
but when I'm looking at cases of,

564
00:26:42,341 --> 00:26:43,174
of uh,
when I prompt prioritize kind of the 

565
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:50,310
light of shining the light of my 
criticism on specific ideas and specific

566
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,140
human behavior,
I'm looking by and large for the,

567
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,243
the,
the craziest and most dangerous ideas 

568
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,640
that should be,
I mean it's,

569
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,870
this is really the low hanging fruit for
kind of bad epistemology.

570
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,043
The thing,
the human behavior that should seem 

571
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,530
impossible,
right?

572
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:08,364
Like,
and suicide bombing was not a drone 

573
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:13,800
bombing.

574
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,820
It's not just the aesthetics.
It's not just aesthetics because because

575
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:21,990
suicidal people are undetectable,
so jihadists are undetectable.

576
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,853
If part of it's the best thing that can 
happen in an operation is that you die 

577
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:29,370
while conducting it.
You are the perfect weapon.

578
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,600
That's fair.
So,

579
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,470
but I just have to hammer,
I have to hammer this home.

580
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,663
When you're talking about the 
possibility of something like nuclear 

581
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:42,670
terrorism or biological terrorism that,
you know,

582
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,840
when someone tries to weaponize 
smallpox,

583
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:48,750
killed 100 million patients,
nuclear terrorism,

584
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,990
he's not hypothetical already happened 
50 years ago.

585
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,880
No,
I won't call it,

586
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,483
I won't call that nuclear terrorism.
There was certainly a first piece of 

587
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,180
dice semantics would be your primary 
concern.

588
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,630
Nobody call that thing.
But how my teeth,

589
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,503
it's reasonable to ask,
well how the Japanese view it now and 

590
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:11,280
how the Japanese view their relationship
with the United States.

591
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:12,510
Now it's,
it's a,

592
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,460
there's,
there's an argument.

593
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,293
I'm not,
I'm not defending narrative Sam that 

594
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:17,814
supersede the uh,
power and narrative of nationalism and 

595
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,170
geopolitics gift where there is that,
but they make sense,

596
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,880
determine it.
They make the,

597
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,043
the,
the Japan and the US no longer see 

598
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:30,110
themselves in a position or positions.
Right?

599
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,441
Well,
so what,

600
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:32,274
so one question is how,
how are we going to get all of these 

601
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,580
societies that are at loggerheads to see
themselves in Nonzero sum,

602
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,110
uh,
arrangements with everyone else and um,

603
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,023
and what's,
what we'll have to change to make that 

604
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:51,870
possible.
And my concern with religion,

605
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,480
religious fundamentalism and not all 
religions equally.

606
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,670
Um,
but uh,

607
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:02,030
my concern is that these are the beliefs
that are held most closely.

608
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,840
They're the least negotiable.
I mean,

609
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:06,250
they're by definition non negotiable.
These are the,

610
00:29:06,251 --> 00:29:07,084
these are my faith based beliefs are the
beliefs that that if you challenge them 

611
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,470
that will buy whatever evidence or 
whatever argument,

612
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,400
I will take that as a personal insult 
and I will want,

613
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,190
want to resort immediately to violence 
or the threat of violence.

614
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,024
I will want blasphemy laws.
I would want to pass a law at the UN 

615
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,830
that will,
that will give you jail time.

616
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,870
If you say the wrong thing about my holy
book,

617
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,033
right?
That's where conversation has totally 

618
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:33,030
broken down and there's nothing to,
to resort to.

619
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:36,150
But for us,
when you say a suicide bomber,

620
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:40,590
I bet it's an extraordinary,
and it's difficult for us to understand.

621
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:42,160
But what I'm curious

622
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,180
about,
Sam is the,

623
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,010
what are the prerequisite conditions for
suicide bombing even to be relevant.

624
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:50,680
And I also can't help but thinking when 
I sort of feel when,

625
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:51,514
when we sort of recall events like waco 
or any disruption or anything that sort 

626
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:58,390
of ruptures the sort of like the,
the uh,

627
00:29:58,391 --> 00:30:00,100
American mainframe are not American.
So here,

628
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,780
this goes beyond nation.
If you put,

629
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:04,240
if you find yourself in opposition to 
the state,

630
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,283
the means by which the state will deploy
violence doesn't need to resort to sort 

631
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:10,180
of Lurid,
livid,

632
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,180
blatant clumsy acts like suicide 
bombing.

633
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:14,014
Because the power is so evident,
the ability to exert power and control 

634
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,933
is so total that it doesn't need sort of
like almost the sort of graphic and 

635
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:24,034
horrific whimsy of something like a 
suicide bombing all be underwritten by 

636
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:32,730
something that looks peculiar to people 
like us that value life and value fine,

637
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,120
don't have a belief system that's like,
oh,

638
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:37,390
I'll be in some sort of a Valhalla 
subsequently.

639
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,743
Well you were using Waco is an example 
of state oppression or suicidal 

640
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,100
sacrifice.

641
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,990
I'm using it as an example of the 
[inaudible].

642
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,770
The,
the,

643
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,000
the,
the kind of violence that interest me is

644
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:53,820
the violence of the truly powerful and 
the kindness.

645
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,820
So for me,
I said like suicide,

646
00:30:55,821 --> 00:31:00,020
but I can see that it's kind of,
it's gratuitous and sort of,

647
00:31:00,021 --> 00:31:03,080
and therefore an appealing form.
But for me when,

648
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:03,914
when analyzing nine 11 to focus on the 
perpetration of that event and the 

649
00:31:10,461 --> 00:31:11,294
motivation of the individuals involved 
as opposed to the geopolitical 

650
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:16,570
circumstances.
Um,

651
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,443
and what happens generally when two 
narratives come into conflict with one 

652
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:24,590
another,
short changes us and means that we focus

653
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,424
like I'm my sole interest.
Sam is who he like when you talk about 

654
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:32,120
how are we going to get these 7 billion 
people to cooperate and form communities

655
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,983
based on mutual values,
which for some reason I believe is a 

656
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:37,760
possibility,
my own spirit,

657
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:38,594
my own spiritual pursuits if led me to 
the point where I have a basic 

658
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:41,714
optimistic view of humanity,
my own personal experience with Muslims 

659
00:31:44,271 --> 00:31:49,271
is led me to believe that Islam is eight
essentially a positive thing,

660
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,953
a positive thing.
But that's a bad way to take his 

661
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:54,360
temperature.
You're at me cause how many Muslims have

662
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:56,880
you had a personal experience with our,
granted you,

663
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,770
you're taking the temperature on the 
bicep bloody suicide bombers and no,

664
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:00,061
no,
no,

665
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:00,660
no,
no,

666
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,141
no,
no.

667
00:32:01,141 --> 00:32:01,974
I'm,
I'm taking the temperature on the basis 

668
00:32:02,641 --> 00:32:05,760
of the actual doctrine that makes sense 
of this behavior.

669
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,820
And also aspects of the doctrine that 
aspects of the,

670
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:09,641
no,
no it's,

671
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:10,080
but wait,
wait,

672
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,670
hold on.
Let me just,

673
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,863
I got to,

674
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,703
I could imagine that we'd have this 
conversation then there'd be a bit we 

675
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,110
went,
yeah,

676
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,280
he sounds not that bad.

677
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,030
I think come into this room.
We're thinking that,

678
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,123
but it's,
it's worth connecting with you have 

679
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:25,370
these dots because it's not just a 
matter of the killing of people.

680
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,140
I'm talking about how people want to 
live.

681
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,900
So if you ask yourself,
and this is just a thought experiment,

682
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,003
um,
if you ask yourself if you gave perfect 

683
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:36,500
power to any one group,
right.

684
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,990
And they,
so they could impose their way of life,

685
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,250
every other group.
So he gave him,

686
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,130
this is my magic wand argument that I 
use in my first book.

687
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,211
Um,
you know,

688
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:46,490
Give Dick Cheney a magic wand and Dick 
Cheney,

689
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:49,850
the prototypical evil mustache twirling 
bastard,

690
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:52,060
who,
who gave us the Iraq war and,

691
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:55,370
and is as demonized on the left as,
as anyone.

692
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,800
What would he have done if he had the 
power,

693
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,663
you know,
just to make a life in the Middle East 

694
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:02,200
and Afghanistan

695
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,100
any way he wanted.
It doesn't need to.

696
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,973
We did not need to conjecture.
They said we want to ever remove the 

697
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:11,870
ability of our opponents to respond.
It's in the public sphere.

698
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,080
Let's go a little further.

699
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,560
Let's,
no,

700
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,030
let's go a little further in our 
imagination.

701
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,570
Do you actually think,
uh,

702
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,720
and maybe Dick Cheney has been so 
demonized that he's the wrong case here,

703
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,700
but I have a strong opinion.
But Dick Cheney.

704
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

705
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:29,610
I,
you know,

706
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,800
how you spell that is,
this is what I would guess,

707
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,180
right?
Someone like Dick Cheney,

708
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:37,810
if given unlimited Ken unload just magic
the resources of magic magic,

709
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,860
you're doing like a two to narrow 
reading of that,

710
00:33:43,861 --> 00:33:44,251
right?
Yes.

711
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:46,350
We don't want to be a bit that,
we don't want these people to be able to

712
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:47,011
attack us.
Right?

713
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:48,600
That's the goal of the war.
I'm saying,

714
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,420
oh,
oppose our objectives,

715
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,000
but what are,
so let's go.

716
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:58,640
So what would we want that region for a 
kickoff?

717
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,590
We won't tell on challenged.

718
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,570
No,
no,

719
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,230
but I'm talking about,
I'm talking about magic.

720
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:05,360
We don't even need to steal their 
resources.

721
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:06,194
We have the power of magic.
Now what will life would you impose on 

722
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:09,920
these people?
Right?

723
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,790
What?
What life would would the worst of us in

724
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:15,050
power,
like Dick Cheney impose on these people?

725
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,320
I think he'd make Afghanistan or Iraq,
like Nebraska,

726
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:22,940
right?
This would not,

727
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,550
he would not be some hell scape of 
unnecessary suffering.

728
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,390
It would be a starbucks on every corner.
Mere capitalism.

729
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,460
Now you have your critique of this way 
of life.

730
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:33,440
No doubt.
But he would w what?

731
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:37,880
What he would want to impose on these 
people is orderly economic,

732
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,280
probably good Christian behavior.
Right?

733
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,233
He would want movie theaters.
It all be watching the Oscars right now 

734
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,433
what?
What would Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi impose 

735
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:51,830
on everyone else?
He's told us explicitly because he tried

736
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:56,831
the experiment in Syria and Iraq.
We know exactly how he wants to live and

737
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:57,794
he wants others to live.
It is seventh century theocratic 

738
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:03,320
barbarism and there's no doubt about 
that.

739
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,710
It is fornicators homosexuals thrown 
from rooftops and fornicators.

740
00:35:07,711 --> 00:35:07,880
Yeah.

741
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,713
Whether it's their throats slit.
Shortly we can agree on is that what 

742
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,560
the,
the second guy name,

743
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:17,561
I don't know.
Is it relevant and broadly speaking,

744
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:24,881
irrelevant in terms of view of 7 billion
individuals.

745
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,620
Dick Cheney's,
starbucks on every corner

746
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,080
there are 1.7
billion Muslims,

747
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:37,250
majority of which live under some 
significant theocratic constraint.

748
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,040
You're talking

749
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,970
about women,
it's not the same theocracy.

750
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:42,804
Listen,
I'm just as concerned about Christian 

751
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:46,110
theocracy as you are.
How can you,

752
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,140
cause I think like you're about to talk 
about sort of gender issues,

753
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:51,690
but you're,
once again it's free thought issues.

754
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,130
It's shines.
Surely but,

755
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,130
but,
but the metric by which we evaluate them

756
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:56,964
is a distinct metric could drawn from 
another narrative and the free and 

757
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:01,650
alfred like so like you know,
we might say,

758
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:03,330
oh bloody hell women dressing live out 
or whatever,

759
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:03,840
you know,
we call it,

760
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,970
I don't think we're in a position to 
make those kinds of decisions.

761
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:07,410
Of course we are.
Of course we are.

762
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,570
You don't think you're in a position 
think the,

763
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,210
their narrative should adhere to our 
template.

764
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:12,691
Well,
first of all,

765
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:13,524
so,
so you're a man,

766
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,350
you imagine that most women forced to 
wear a burqa.

767
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:17,370
I don't know about forced.

768
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,203
And my experience in conversation is 
being that it's more that we ought to 

769
00:36:21,421 --> 00:36:22,520
regard it.
I think we have,

770
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,050
I've asked Muslim women about it and 
they said to me,

771
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:25,884
it's like,
it's like a discipline and when we dig 

772
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:28,620
it,
but first of all,

773
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:30,570
we're,
now I'm talking about a burka.

774
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:31,404
I'm not talking about someone going to 
Barnard who elects to wear a headscarf 

775
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:40,140
because she likes the way,
I don't like the imposition of a,

776
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:40,974
like a,
of our heterogeneous haitch demonic 

777
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,710
ideas of how masculine,
feminine relationships work might not be

778
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:50,970
universally applicable.
Something is universally applicable.

779
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,560
And if it's not universal,

780
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,403
we can understand those differences.
So if there's a culture where they like 

781
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:58,800
spicy food and we don't,
uh,

782
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,800
but eating spicy food is just another 
way to be happy as a,

783
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,570
as a,
as an ape,

784
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,753
uh,
we can understand those differences 

785
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:08,170
biologically and culturally.
This,

786
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,520
the idea that it just may be as good as 
solution for the,

787
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,870
the how to maximize human wellbeing,
uh,

788
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:22,510
to put half the population in bags from 
the moment that and,

789
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,120
and not,
and not let them learn to read.

790
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:25,230
I mean,
I'm taking Afghanistan,

791
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:28,260
I'm taking the local case of Afghanistan
under the Taliban,

792
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,910
uh,
and uh,

793
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:31,380
you know,
and it may well fall back.

794
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:34,200
I mean it's,
it's actually a Afghanistan currently as

795
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:36,710
well.
You're talking about women who

796
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:37,723
are,
who have almost the worst possible life 

797
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:41,290
on planet earth.
I mean,

798
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:44,890
we're talking about maternal mortality 
rates that are off the charts.

799
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,630
You're talking about,
uh,

800
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:47,943
illiteracy.
That is that you have to go back 200 

801
00:37:49,871 --> 00:37:50,704
years in the west to find that level of 
illiteracy reasoning that's used to 

802
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:57,970
justify the bombing.
I know it's not an actual colonization.

803
00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:59,710
If those territories,
they're not like us,

804
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:00,544
they treat women different from us.
I don't think position to make those 

805
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:04,294
judgements.
So then tell me how you would react to 

806
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:06,581
this.
I have two.

807
00:38:06,581 --> 00:38:07,414
I have two daughters.
And if I were thinking the way you were 

808
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:09,963
thinking about this issue,
what if I thought it would be a great 

809
00:38:12,101 --> 00:38:12,934
idea to have a cultural exchange program
where I just sent my daughter's over to 

810
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:18,430
Afghanistan to live with a Taliban 
family.

811
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:19,264
So rather than go to summer school here 
and get prepared to go to an Ivy League 

812
00:38:22,061 --> 00:38:24,150
college or whatever it is,
I send them to learn.

813
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,620
I send them to live with the Taliban.
Explained all this to be,

814
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:28,050
I said,
well,

815
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,600
nobody but nobody.
You got to answer it fully experiments.

816
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,443
Well,
I'm from a Western culled up in 

817
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:36,130
indoctrinated

818
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,900
dispute.
No right or wrong.

819
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,870
I don't think that there's the eye.
I'm not in a position.

820
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:42,220
I think he's very different.
Me Saying,

821
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:44,190
I've been born in the west,
I've grown up in the west.

822
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:47,550
My daughter's born in the West now 
impose upon her a tilt,

823
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,403
totally different set of values.
I want to go to the deep south over who 

824
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,820
wanted to go to places in Britain.
Yeah.

825
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,070
You don't think it's unlucky to be born 
a girl in Afghanistan five years ago.

826
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,103
I think that these kind of a sort of 
theoretical tableaus are used to create 

827
00:39:06,321 --> 00:39:07,154
a force hierarchy and a moral 
superiority by a dominant culture that 

828
00:39:11,961 --> 00:39:16,961
subsequently uses thinking of this of 
this nature to underwrite the modern day

829
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:19,844
colonization and subjugation of these 
people on a massive scale as barbaric 

830
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:25,184
and a disgusting is nine 11 was a daily 
nine 11 since then so that that's a 

831
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:30,734
state system can perpetuate yourself 
using rationalism using comfortable 

832
00:39:35,031 --> 00:39:40,031
means of executions that glides slyly by
all why in the sky is no better than the

833
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,470
nine 11 news over patterns too.

834
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,900
It is.
It is better to let,

835
00:39:45,901 --> 00:39:46,734
we can talk.
So you're invoking a many things here 

836
00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:52,080
which we should treat systematically.
Things like collateral damage.

837
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,810
So you

838
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:56,170
you drop a bomb like that language.
It's a euphemism.

839
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,343
It's a euphemism but that's,
that's the word we use to talk about 

840
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,710
unintended people getting killed by 
[inaudible].

841
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:06,180
What was it like when a 7% of drone 
structures eight a result in a that day?

842
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,350
The data here are hard to get our hands 
around as well.

843
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,210
Highly politicized.
Yes,

844
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,060
of course it is the then the language is
important.

845
00:40:14,061 --> 00:40:14,894
And who decides what language is used 
and who decides where powerful and who 

846
00:40:17,811 --> 00:40:20,690
decides what's rational violence and who
decides what religion is even,

847
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,010
right.

848
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,180
Okay.
But so let's,

849
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:24,520
let's treat these things point by point.
So

850
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,260
first,
now let's take them in a giddy.

851
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,100
Blah.
I'm trying to get out of the Blue

852
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,690
Giddy blur is now in my mind.
Um,

853
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,153
so there's a,
there's a fundamental claim that you 

854
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:40,100
have just made it at least implicitly 
that I disagree with.

855
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:42,030
And then I wrote my third book to rebut 
that.

856
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:42,291
The,
the,

857
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:43,124
my third book,
the moral landscape is an argument that 

858
00:40:45,681 --> 00:40:46,514
we can talk about questions of right and
wrong and good and evil in universal 

859
00:40:49,971 --> 00:40:50,804
terms.
That these are not merely cultural or 

860
00:40:53,211 --> 00:40:56,240
personal affectations right?
It's not that we're not free.

861
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,360
You make it one of your full experience 
minced in a minute.

862
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:58,730
No,
no,

863
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,220
no.
Because see you on the edge of the,

864
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,700
we'll just have sex with her baby.
The were say it's wrong.

865
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,020
The reason why thought experiments are 
so useful is that there the,

866
00:41:07,021 --> 00:41:08,240
the,
the pure case,

867
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:08,931
right?
They're not,

868
00:41:08,931 --> 00:41:10,010
they will,
you can just,

869
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:13,140
you can take one variable at a time.
Um,

870
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,810
so,
um,

871
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,913
but this idea that it's all a matter of 
personal taste or all a matter of 

872
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:22,310
culture,
right?

873
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:27,650
It suggests that all all cultures,
therefore our,

874
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:27,971
I mean,
the,

875
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:28,804
the moment you make the link between 
question of good and evil and the well 

876
00:41:31,961 --> 00:41:32,794
being of conscious,
like questions of happiness and 

877
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:35,744
suffering,
right?

878
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,340
And I think that link is very direct.
I mean,

879
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:38,600
that's a separate conversation we can 
have,

880
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:39,434
but,
but I think the only intelligible 

881
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,300
morality has to focus on human 
suffering,

882
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,134
human wellbeing,
and even more broadly to the suffering 

883
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:49,340
of any conscious system.
So it's animals.

884
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,213
If we're,
if we're torturing pigs so as to get 

885
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:53,130
bacon,
uh,

886
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,660
that is that we have an ethical 
obligation to not do that,

887
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:01,280
do that last,
find a better way of doing that.

888
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,690
So that is no longer torture breed pigs 
that don't suffer,

889
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,533
whatever it is.
But what suffering should be our 

890
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:09,360
concern.
And if,

891
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,440
and so if the moment you grant that you 
have to grant that not every culture and

892
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:18,680
not every society and certainly not 
every family,

893
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,730
right,
has perfectly solved the human wellbeing

894
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,833
problem,
right?

895
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,810
They haven't solved at equally.
So if you find a family over here that's

896
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:30,000
forcing their children to live in a 
basement for 20 years and,

897
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,030
and um,
to,

898
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:34,310
to interbreed and not,
not showing them the light of day,

899
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,480
okay,
this is,

900
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:39,320
this is a problem that society has an 
interest in.

901
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,243
Now we're now we're now we're talking 
about power dynamics where the society 

902
00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:43,214
has an interest in rescue in those 
children from their deranged and evil 

903
00:42:46,461 --> 00:42:48,740
parents.
Right within this,

904
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,720
just this,
this could be true just in a single city

905
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:51,830
like Los Angeles,
right?

906
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,030
As has happened very recently.
Um,

907
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:59,180
the,
that scales that scales to whole nations

908
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,160
and,
and to,

909
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:00,810
uh,

910
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:01,960
right,
global situation.

911
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,880
Politically it does.
Yeah.

912
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,753
Politically complex.
But for you to withhold judgment of the 

913
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:10,910
burqa makes absolutely no sense for you 
to withhold judgment of

914
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:14,070
no female genital mutilation.
Makes absolutely no sense.

915
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,400
It's a different way,
again,

916
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,140
now,
now,

917
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:18,700
now.

918
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,790
Perfect case of getting misled by words 
because they're,

919
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,320
they're highly non analogous.
Those two procedures.

920
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:24,843
I'm not,
I'm not in favor of male circumcision 

921
00:43:25,841 --> 00:43:26,674
either,
but I'm just saying just talk it to use 

922
00:43:27,911 --> 00:43:29,490
the word mutilation or circumcision

923
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,230
synonymously.
Word mutilation.

924
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,040
No,
you just jumped to the men though.

925
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:33,893
Yes,
I listen when we sort of interchange 

926
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:36,943
styles of dress,
we're still in the caddy blur by the 

927
00:43:39,191 --> 00:43:42,070
way.
I never leave it and personal submission

928
00:43:42,071 --> 00:43:42,904
when we interchange that with sort of 
like sort of a subjugation of a family 

929
00:43:46,121 --> 00:43:47,530
and keep people in the cellar.
But you know,

930
00:43:47,531 --> 00:43:49,450
there's different levels of complexity.
Now I'd like to,

931
00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:50,284
if,
if I may shift gears a little sad 

932
00:43:51,441 --> 00:43:52,274
because one of my great interest in you 
is your immense intellectual capacity 

933
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:56,854
and jaw,
uh,

934
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:57,723
what I want to call it without being 
deliberately provocative zeal and love 

935
00:44:02,561 --> 00:44:03,394
of ethics and morality.
And I would like to know how that 

936
00:44:05,981 --> 00:44:10,570
relates to your personal spiritual life.
I know you are a great meditator.

937
00:44:10,571 --> 00:44:11,141
You said like,
you know,

938
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:13,240
I've never had there Jesus,
two years silence.

939
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:14,590
I think I'd struggled for 25.

940
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:14,921
Well,
I mean,

941
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:17,240
I meditate twice a day for 20 minutes 
and I don't find this right,

942
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:17,890
right.
Yeah.

943
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:18,723
No,
I mean for me this stuff is the answer 

944
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,720
now.
What the reason I meditate,

945
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:23,583
the reason that I embrace the spiritual 
life is because I believe I've 

946
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,353
experienced,
I've experienced that for me personally 

947
00:44:30,311 --> 00:44:31,144
to become a valuable of society.
Wherever that song on the microlevel of 

948
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,000
my family and hopefully on a broader 
level,

949
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:37,463
I have to take personal responsibility 
for the fact that I'm a complex 

950
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:40,704
individual that are within me.
All of the things I would condemn over 

951
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:45,300
the course of a podcast talking to a 
brilliant man like yourself.

952
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:46,143
Maybe one minute I'll condemn violence 
another minute I'll come down condemn 

953
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:52,110
egotism and self centeredness.
The I am victim to all of these.

954
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:56,460
I'm perpetrator of self centeredness and
egocentrism and the tool that has helped

955
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:59,400
me most to overcome these personal 
problems.

956
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,353
There's been a kind of a spiritual 
veltin Shang and I planned to use that 

957
00:45:03,811 --> 00:45:06,750
word with you today.
My German's bad.

958
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:07,983
That's,
that's literally the only German word 

959
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:11,190
you'll hear cause it's the only one I 
know.

960
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,473
So like,
let's say my spirituality has been my 

961
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:17,670
personal vehicle for carrying me away 
from sort of selfishness,

962
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:18,504
self destruction,
and like I'm talking as a peasant's 

963
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:20,600
overcome,
not,

964
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:21,120
oh,
you know,

965
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,000
through the help of others.
And to a degree,

966
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:25,980
faith,
I must say to a huge degree faith,

967
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,800
uh,
my own addiction.

968
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,870
Now you've got a addiction issues,
haven't you?

969
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:34,740
Habitation you just for you dabbling in 
it.

970
00:45:34,741 --> 00:45:37,900
Was your brother know like Dan?
No,

971
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,390
neither.
If you've got no addiction background.

972
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:40,830
No,
no.

973
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,950
Dan Harris had Dan Harris,
who's,

974
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:45,420
who's also,
he's a friend.

975
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:46,290
He's not,
there's no relation,

976
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:51,720
but he wrote the book 10% happier and it
was a big bestseller about mindfulness.

977
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,210
And so he's had issues that he's talked 
about.

978
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:54,970
I see.
Well,

979
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,790
so forgive me.
So my person,

980
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:57,883
like,
so my personal experiences have been 

981
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:04,431
that sort of spirituality and a faith 
that is determined resolutely by as best

982
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:08,550
as possible,
nonjudgmental realism,

983
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,280
a benevolence,
kindness,

984
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,143
being of service to others,
principles that broadly speaking don't 

985
00:46:16,021 --> 00:46:20,100
require me to enter into conflict,
but to be off service.

986
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,000
Uh,
the,

987
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,833
this for me,
I think is an incredibly valuable 

988
00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:24,084
resource.
And,

989
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,983
and,
and these things and ethics in general 

990
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,760
are drawn.
I'll not ultimately,

991
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:31,890
because prior,
who knows what proceeded religion,

992
00:46:31,891 --> 00:46:32,724
some form of theater and ritual.
Who knows what they're doing down deep 

993
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:36,384
in the dank of the forests,
what gods they device there were 

994
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,590
conscious,
well,

995
00:46:40,591 --> 00:46:42,870
precisely where consciousness is a 
little more open.

996
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,790
I suppose what I,
I want to understand it.

997
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:45,624
So it has,
how does your personal spirituality 

998
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,490
serve you ethically and,
and uh,

999
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:53,100
where does that intersect with beyond 
tolerance?

1000
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,350
Because tolerance suggests that there's 
something to tolerate.

1001
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:59,670
Where does it lead you to a compassion 
and love?

1002
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:00,563
And what solutions do you think can be 
derived from your personal understood 

1003
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:06,690
your present experiences of mysticism 
and spirituality?

1004
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,050
Where I would say first that it,
it really,

1005
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,620
while it may seem different from what 
we've been just talking about,

1006
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:15,480
it's of a piece with what we've just 
been talking about.

1007
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:16,314
And the reason why I have such passion 
for criticizing this particular species 

1008
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:20,424
of bad ideas,
the religious ones is because I see the 

1009
00:47:22,951 --> 00:47:25,680
baby and the bath water that everyone is
afraid of losing.

1010
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,280
And I see that it doesn't require any 
bullshit

1011
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,050
too to be saved,
right?

1012
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:32,884
You don't have to lie to yourself.
You don't have to believe that a book 

1013
00:47:34,931 --> 00:47:36,370
was written by the creator of the 
universe.

1014
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:37,443
You don't have to believe that that hell
fire weights people who don't call 

1015
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:40,913
historical person by the right name.
You don't have to believe any of those 

1016
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:43,984
things.
And all of those things are absolutely 

1017
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:47,830
integral to the doctrines of these 
religions.

1018
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,083
Uh,
and there's many separate religions on 

1019
00:47:51,421 --> 00:47:51,570
off

1020
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:52,403
for that are incompatible.
I think there's a point where religion 

1021
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,630
and politics intersect and it's not 
always clear where that line is drawn.

1022
00:47:57,631 --> 00:48:01,410
And I would say that the point where 
spirituality stops being about kindness,

1023
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:02,071
love,
fun.

1024
00:48:02,071 --> 00:48:05,040
Remember earlier in this podcast you did
the list if the things that difficult to

1025
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:07,080
quantify scientifically.
And I would wonder how,

1026
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:07,691
uh,
how,

1027
00:48:07,691 --> 00:48:08,524
how a valuable and a useful those image 
scans and neuro image scans are when 

1028
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,710
dealing with fun and love.
I'm sure they have great service,

1029
00:48:16,711 --> 00:48:18,840
I'm sure,
but like these things,

1030
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,040
the way that we access them,
the way that we increase them.

1031
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:23,780
And,
and to your earlier point,

1032
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,660
the way that we as best as possible 
eliminate suffering.

1033
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,853
For me,
this is the function and the role of 

1034
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:31,710
spirituality.
And,

1035
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:32,544
and I think sort of some of the 
furniture and ornamentation that 

1036
00:48:34,321 --> 00:48:35,154
religions are variously acquired due to 
the cultural influx infections of the 

1037
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:41,640
times in which they were conceived for 
me are less important and less relevant.

1038
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:42,474
Whilst I acknowledge that I'm a 
relatively unique case and some of the 

1039
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,080
extreme,
uh,

1040
00:48:46,081 --> 00:48:48,460
issues that you're addressing,
I,

1041
00:48:48,461 --> 00:48:49,200
I'm,
you know,

1042
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,033
I've been not imaginary.
I know that what you're saying is true 

1043
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,313
and there's baby bath water issue.
I'm interested in the baby always on 

1044
00:48:56,551 --> 00:48:57,384
about a bath.

1045
00:48:58,930 --> 00:48:59,763
Well,
so what you just described about your 

1046
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:04,760
own spiritual life and ethical life,
um,

1047
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:09,010
it is obvious to me that there are 
universal principles there that what you

1048
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:12,370
just described about the consequences of
paying attention to certain things.

1049
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,870
So,
so meditation,

1050
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,250
uh,
uh,

1051
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:18,370
getting off certain substances that are 
not good for you.

1052
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:19,204
So,
you know,

1053
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,920
breaking with,
with addiction,

1054
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:26,430
these are universal features of what 
it's like to have a human mind that is,

1055
00:49:28,421 --> 00:49:33,340
is based on human neurochemistry.
Uh,

1056
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,110
and,
um,

1057
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,810
this is not something we just made up.
It's not something that's,

1058
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:42,070
that's a purely a product of our time.
It's not merely cultural.

1059
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,233
And that's why sticking girls in bags 
for their entire lives and not letting 

1060
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:48,094
them read

1061
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:51,270
bad derisory it is,
it's exactly what,

1062
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,490
it's exactly what happened

1063
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:53,420
in,
in Afghanistan.

1064
00:49:53,421 --> 00:49:54,260
I'm not,
I'm not talking about,

1065
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:56,180
again,
I'm not talking about the voluntary.

1066
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,960
Uh,
should you use a century language if you

1067
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:01,390
are here to convey love?
It's exactly,

1068
00:50:01,391 --> 00:50:02,950
it's like no because,
no,

1069
00:50:02,951 --> 00:50:03,784
because

1070
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,990
pretend to love girls.
If you're not as concerned as I am about

1071
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,490
this ms treatment of them.

1072
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,310
I don't pretend to understand,
but you should.

1073
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:17,220
It's not for girls.
They're girls and the Americans.

1074
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,830
It's not that you're overthinking it,
you're overthinking.

1075
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:23,160
It has nothing to do with skin color 
knows what the level of thought.

1076
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,690
That's [inaudible] Sam,
but you like,

1077
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,300
you know,
you all in American,

1078
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:33,550
I can introduce you.
Just take a few facts on board here.

1079
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:38,590
I can introduce you to women who have of
what?

1080
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,660
Oh,
whatever shade of Brown skin,

1081
00:50:40,661 --> 00:50:44,630
you require my requirement,
who holds about me,

1082
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:45,523
who have grown up in these cultures,
who will say exactly what I'm saying 

1083
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:50,420
about the consequences of compulsive 
gambling.

1084
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,650
No country,
no,

1085
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:55,030
no.

1086
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:55,720
What do you say?
No,

1087
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,750
but no subjugation is the same in yoga 
or exercise.

1088
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,310
But you're,
you're,

1089
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,360
you're,
you're drawing the wrong lesson here.

1090
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,710
I'm,
I'm back.

1091
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,121
No,
no,

1092
00:51:07,121 --> 00:51:08,500
no,
because you're just missing a few facts.

1093
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:11,680
If you have those two people have a 
conversation.

1094
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:12,543
If you take someone like I on her cle or
Sarah Haider who runs the ex Muslims of 

1095
00:51:17,081 --> 00:51:18,040
North America,
right?

1096
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,760
And you have her talk to someone like 
Linda Sarsour,

1097
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,980
you know the Hijabi,
uh,

1098
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,750
icon of the woman's March,
right?

1099
00:51:25,751 --> 00:51:26,584
Darlene,
if the left now who's actually a closet 

1100
00:51:28,061 --> 00:51:31,750
theocrat and quite an nefarious person 
when you get her talking about religion,

1101
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:34,120
I mean she will,
she will not admit that life for,

1102
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:38,680
for women in Saudi Arabia is,
is bad by comparison at all for,

1103
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:39,514
with life for women in the West having 
such a complicit trades relationships 

1104
00:51:43,031 --> 00:51:46,150
with them.
Then I'll agree with you there.

1105
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,610
So,
but if you have two women have this sort

1106
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,690
talk,
right?

1107
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,523
One Who has,
who has taken off the hijab for reasons 

1108
00:51:52,721 --> 00:51:56,590
of not wanting to wear it and wanting to
live in a system where she's free not to

1109
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:58,150
wear it,
and one who says,

1110
00:51:58,151 --> 00:51:58,984
I'm wearing it purely as an expression 
of my own religious faith and it's just 

1111
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:07,411
pure women empower female empowerment.
If you let that conversation proceed,

1112
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,140
you'll see that this side has to lie 
endlessly about the,

1113
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:16,210
the actual doctrines about why most 
people,

1114
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,490
most women,
most of the time are wearing this there.

1115
00:52:18,491 --> 00:52:21,160
It's being forced upon them.
And maybe we'll talk about the misuse of

1116
00:52:21,161 --> 00:52:24,220
power you're talking about.
You're talking about mean to take,

1117
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,113
take the perfect case.
It sounds like it's a thought 

1118
00:52:26,531 --> 00:52:27,970
experiment,
but it actually happened.

1119
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,103
You take the religious police in Mecca 
who wouldn't let the girls who are 

1120
00:52:33,071 --> 00:52:36,760
burning alive in a dormitory be rescued 
because they weren't wearing their,

1121
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,020
their veils,
right?

1122
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:38,854
They wouldn't let the firemen go in and 
rescue girls from a burning building 

1123
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,880
because they weren't properly vale.
But that's,

1124
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,780
that's the,
that's the reductio ad absurdum this

1125
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:49,470
gender relationships in this country 
have become so complex,

1126
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:50,304
particularly where we're both fathers,
but you can judge the sure and the 

1127
00:52:56,161 --> 00:53:01,050
aesthetic obligations that will be 
placed upon my dor to look a certain way

1128
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,610
to behave a certain way to believe.
So

1129
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:04,563
I don't,
I don't even think that's a reasonable 

1130
00:53:05,411 --> 00:53:06,244
possibility.
I just think you are in a position to 

1131
00:53:07,511 --> 00:53:11,280
judge how wrong that would be and if 
someone is used to judge how wrong,

1132
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,050
what would be imposing those 
restrictions on your girls?

1133
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,240
You know,
that would be a bad,

1134
00:53:16,241 --> 00:53:19,540
a diminishment of the wellbeing of your 
girls and to pretend to not know what if

1135
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:20,374
a girl in Afghanistan

1136
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:21,493
turning to this fish is in my idea.
Why are you not more concerned that by 

1137
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:26,700
the continual objectification

1138
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:31,700
of women over that female sexuality,
the advertising industry using females,

1139
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,770
it's a different order of problem,
but I'm totally with you,

1140
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,613
but we just want these more prominent.
What do you think is more likely to 

1141
00:53:39,631 --> 00:53:40,464
happen to your daughter?
That she's going to be whisked off to 

1142
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:44,790
Afghanistan?
It's been wife number five or that she's

1143
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:47,780
going to have sex with some days because
she's got that here.

1144
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:52,170
My concern is for both things,
you consensually for reality,

1145
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:53,803
like an abstract ideas that play into 
the hands of an already a power dynamic 

1146
00:53:59,371 --> 00:54:03,300
and a well-served power dynamics.
Let's get who's side are we all?

1147
00:54:03,301 --> 00:54:05,870
But let's get,
who does the grail serves I have,

1148
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,500
where is this mythic truth?
Where does perennialism come from?

1149
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,770
Why are these themes found throughout 
the great faiths,

1150
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,720
the oneness,
the unity,

1151
00:54:15,721 --> 00:54:18,950
the possibilities for love.
We're going Giddy Sam,

1152
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,990
we go for another ride in the tumble 
dryer of love.

1153
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:23,483
So let me try to connect a few of these 
things because you're concerned about 

1154
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:29,670
power,
right?

1155
00:54:29,671 --> 00:54:31,980
And you're concerned about the misuse of
our power.

1156
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,860
We're so,
so our being Western power say

1157
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:35,923
I suppose it,
but to tell the truth like now I've got 

1158
00:54:37,581 --> 00:54:38,260
ya.
Okay.

1159
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,790
Like I don't even,
I think that those,

1160
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:43,940
that mosque of nationalism is 
superficial.

1161
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:48,740
Let the real power operates and has done
probably since British colonialism on an

1162
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,633
economic scale that doesn't pay a great 
deal of attention to sort of trade 

1163
00:54:53,361 --> 00:54:54,194
tariffs.
All those very trade terrace have we 

1164
00:54:54,981 --> 00:54:56,000
drawn up,
you know,

1165
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,870
we've the powerful in mind.
So what for me,

1166
00:54:59,871 --> 00:55:02,180
Sam,
what interests me and not sort of like,

1167
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,111
while I,
you know,

1168
00:55:03,111 --> 00:55:05,730
I'm got no argument bloody isis when I 
read about that southern kingdom,

1169
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:06,843
some terrifying shit going down.
But what interests me more is who is it 

1170
00:55:10,971 --> 00:55:15,410
that gets to determine what is happening
in the world in my life right now?

1171
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,633
And it seems to me that,
that that's transnational corporations 

1172
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:22,280
and governments of Western democracies 
that don't need to resort to the kind of

1173
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:23,263
a sort of vivid acts of violence on 
their domestic population because it's 

1174
00:55:26,331 --> 00:55:27,164
unnecessary because we've all been 
beautifully conditioned and when it is 

1175
00:55:30,381 --> 00:55:32,660
required,
when brutality and violence is required,

1176
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,510
it will be used.
It is enacted.

1177
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:41,140
And that when me seems more important 
than people responding to that power,

1178
00:55:41,211 --> 00:55:42,044
but it's all important.
And then why is your focus continually 

1179
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:46,850
on this sort of fetishized aspect?

1180
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:47,650
Well,
it's,

1181
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,120
it's,
it's again,

1182
00:55:49,121 --> 00:55:53,760
it was just to say fetishized is to,
is to reveal the problem that I,

1183
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:58,480
that that causes me to focus on it.
Because again,

1184
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:02,620
it comes back to the power of ideas.
And I think one of the worst ideas going

1185
00:56:02,621 --> 00:56:04,630
really is the one that you've expressed 
here,

1186
00:56:04,631 --> 00:56:05,464
which is who am I to judge?
I'm just a white guy who grew up in a 

1187
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,940
western context.
Who am I to judge the Burka,

1188
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:12,220
this,
this kind of moral relativism,

1189
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,440
postmodernism.
What?

1190
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:14,891
No,
nobody.

1191
00:56:14,891 --> 00:56:15,450
That'd be the,
this,

1192
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:16,780
this is the order.
This is,

1193
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,340
I know you don't wanna answer to that 
name,

1194
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:22,300
but this is the intellectual trend that 
gave us this kind of,

1195
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,583
uh,
apprehension around making these 

1196
00:56:25,271 --> 00:56:26,410
judgments.
Right?

1197
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:31,620
Who am I to to say what would be the 
good life for somebody else?

1198
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:33,520
And it,
no matter how

1199
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,780
grotesque the example of human 
suffering,

1200
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,970
nonviolence,
compassion and love is the answer,

1201
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:45,530
I'm what I think where we disagree is 
what should be the key target.

1202
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:49,360
What is generating,
generating the problems.

1203
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,400
There are many problems,
but I think to take it at the level of,

1204
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:54,623
of greatest abstraction,
and I think greatest leverage for us to 

1205
00:56:58,231 --> 00:57:02,490
think about it is for the most part,
we,

1206
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:05,910
this is not a problem of the world being
filled with bad people,

1207
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,470
right?
There are some bad people.

1208
00:57:07,471 --> 00:57:08,304
There's some,
it will say 1% of people in every 

1209
00:57:09,751 --> 00:57:11,550
culture are probably psychopaths,
right?

1210
00:57:11,551 --> 00:57:12,384
So there's 1% of people who really do 
feel no compunction about harming other 

1211
00:57:16,111 --> 00:57:16,944
people and they kind of get off on it 
and they're going to keep doing it no 

1212
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:21,270
matter what you change about the system.
Uh,

1213
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:25,980
but most harm is the result of bad 
ideas,

1214
00:57:25,981 --> 00:57:26,814
good people having bad ideas and good 
people being in systems where there are 

1215
00:57:31,291 --> 00:57:33,230
bad incentives.
And what I think we,

1216
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,030
so the crucial word here is incentives,
right?

1217
00:57:36,031 --> 00:57:36,864
I think we need economic systems and 
political systems and institutions and 

1218
00:57:41,881 --> 00:57:45,120
interpret and ways of being with one 
another publicly,

1219
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,350
uh,
which align our incentives in such a way

1220
00:57:49,351 --> 00:57:53,970
so as to make ordinary mediocre,
not so insightful,

1221
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,550
not so reflective,
not so philosophical.

1222
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:01,140
And frankly,
not even that ethical people effort more

1223
00:58:01,141 --> 00:58:02,940
and more effortlessly do the right 
thing,

1224
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,401
right?
So you,

1225
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:06,420
you shouldn't have to be Saint Francis 
of Assisi to,

1226
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,580
to act well in the world,
right?

1227
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,593
But there are systems where the 
incentives are bad enough that you 

1228
00:58:13,111 --> 00:58:17,160
really have to be a moral hero to be 
just basically decent.

1229
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,053
Right?
All of the incentives are pointing the 

1230
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,680
other way.
Right?

1231
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,780
I'll take,
give you an example for this.

1232
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:25,140
Um,
life in a maximum security prison.

1233
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:26,550
So if you,
you're a good guy,

1234
00:58:26,551 --> 00:58:28,150
you're not a racist,
you're a Jew.

1235
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:29,640
You want,
you just want to get along with people.

1236
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,490
If you were put into a maximum security 
prison,

1237
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,400
all the incentives would be pushing you 
the other way.

1238
00:58:35,401 --> 00:58:36,234
So for you,
for you not to join a white gang in a 

1239
00:58:39,301 --> 00:58:43,440
maximum security prison would be 
effectively suicidal.

1240
00:58:43,441 --> 00:58:44,274
Right?
Like you would just be the victim of 

1241
00:58:45,331 --> 00:58:50,331
everyone so that the place is set up to 
segregate everyone by skin color,

1242
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,233
right?
So even if you don't have a racist bone 

1243
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:53,154
in your body,

1244
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:58,650
you're just self preservation alone.
They also concentrated society.

1245
00:58:59,921 --> 00:59:01,470
Exactly.
The royal institution.

1246
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,400
But it's the perfect,
it's a perfect example of bad incentives

1247
00:59:05,401 --> 00:59:07,480
are misaligned incentives,
how these things happen.

1248
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,680
They're happening everywhere,
but most of these,

1249
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,480
most of them,
most of these exams,

1250
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,480
samples of bad incentives are most that.
Most of these examples of where power is

1251
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:20,383
victimizing millions and of people are,
I would argue examples where the system 

1252
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:30,791
is set up in such a way that it is 
reliably x sporting this misery.

1253
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:32,870
Right?
And there's,

1254
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:33,733
there is no author of it.
There is no bad person or they're very 

1255
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:40,550
few bad people.
Who are the actual authors of this,

1256
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,173
uh,
of this human suffering there or the 

1257
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:45,530
perpetrators of it.
It what we have.

1258
00:59:45,531 --> 00:59:50,510
Our systems were selfish people being 
selfish most of the time.

1259
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:55,310
Managed to export a fair amount of 
misery to tell people who are less lucky

1260
00:59:55,311 --> 00:59:56,840
than themselves.
And if we want to,

1261
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:59,540
if we want a fairer economic 
arrangement,

1262
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,750
we have to design it and we have to 
design it for people as they are.

1263
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:05,310
We have to,
we need systems that will allow,

1264
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,240
how about people are mutable?
Yeah,

1265
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,273
exactly.
Is that we respond to ideas and we 

1266
01:00:12,061 --> 01:00:13,370
respond to incentives.
Yes.

1267
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,010
And incentives to be a bit more personal
for a moment.

1268
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,013
Uh,
like are you a bit cynical about human 

1269
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:23,730
beings?
Cause like when we talk it's like I feel

1270
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,360
we've been fighting about terrorism and,
and uh,

1271
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:29,063
female gentlemen genital mutilation with
my pro terrorism protein mutilation 

1272
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,160
starts on those issues,
um,

1273
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:39,240
shoulder to the wall now.
But you seem so very,

1274
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:44,360
you seem like angry about you seem angry
and about humanity.

1275
01:00:45,871 --> 01:00:49,200
Almost all I know.
Think human beings are not good

1276
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:50,730
country.
I see.

1277
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,080
Well they're neither,
I mean we're,

1278
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,330
it's all mixed,
right?

1279
01:00:54,331 --> 01:00:57,390
I mean there were good and were bad and 
we're careless.

1280
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:58,323
Right.
And we're short side the line between 

1281
01:00:59,721 --> 01:01:00,730
good and evil runs through.

1282
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:01,850
Yeah,
absolutely.

1283
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:03,550
That's certainly a more eloquent way of 
saying it,

1284
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:04,840
but it,
it is,

1285
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,170
but there's

1286
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,010
okay

1287
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:08,661
the,
again,

1288
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:09,520
to talk about the,
the,

1289
01:01:09,521 --> 01:01:11,750
the,
the situational problem,

1290
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:13,063
the,

1291
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,550
yeah.

1292
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:19,550
The problem of incentives is doing more 
work than human evil is doing.

1293
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,361
I mean,
I think,

1294
01:01:21,361 --> 01:01:22,270
again,
I think we,

1295
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:23,423
all of us have,
have work to do on ourselves to be 

1296
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:27,600
happier and better people.
Right?

1297
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,000
And that is spiritual life and that is 
ethical life.

1298
01:01:30,001 --> 01:01:32,850
But I think,
I think better than,

1299
01:01:32,851 --> 01:01:33,720
and this,
these are not,

1300
01:01:33,721 --> 01:01:35,430
these are not mutually exclusive 
projects.

1301
01:01:35,431 --> 01:01:36,264
These can be done simultaneously,
but better than each of us figuring out 

1302
01:01:39,631 --> 01:01:41,430
how to be a saint,
um,

1303
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,713
would be to design a system that made it
easier for everyone to be far better 

1304
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,420
than they're tending to be now.
And that's possible.

1305
01:01:48,421 --> 01:01:49,490
I think that's absolutely,
literally

1306
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:54,170
possible to a lot of decentralization 
and the significant change,

1307
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:58,430
particularly in,
in our nations around what is called the

1308
01:01:58,431 --> 01:01:59,264
political.
But I sort of see as the religious now 

1309
01:02:00,561 --> 01:02:01,490
let,
let me tell you something again.

1310
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:05,090
It's again a little more,
what do I want to say?

1311
01:02:05,091 --> 01:02:06,650
Trivial.
So personal.

1312
01:02:06,651 --> 01:02:08,060
It's not trivial.
I A,

1313
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:11,600
the other day I was driving home from,
and I've seen the movie or something.

1314
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:12,434
It was a daytime,
still a homeless guy just collapsed 

1315
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,880
laying in the middle of the road,
you know,

1316
01:02:16,881 --> 01:02:20,360
it's La homeless people just everywhere 
forming shanty

1317
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:24,210
towns like the apocalypse is already 
happened and is creeping in around us.

1318
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,950
Like it's slow tide and it was some 
homeless guy and like,

1319
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,793
Oh,
I know that homeless guy is just laying 

1320
01:02:29,971 --> 01:02:32,280
there.
I should do something about that.

1321
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,440
Amanda didn't,
I just went home and I thought like,

1322
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:38,190
ah,
why didn't I do anything about that?

1323
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:40,060
Great example here.
So,

1324
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:40,913
okay,
it's because in the current system 

1325
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,090
there's nothing very easy to do,
right?

1326
01:02:47,091 --> 01:02:50,180
So like,
so you have to be an absolute moral hero

1327
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:53,990
to do something about that particular 
homeless guy.

1328
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:55,243
And it's very likely that what you would
do wouldn't help a lot and would just 

1329
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:03,200
complicate your life massively.
So let's say you just say,

1330
01:03:03,201 --> 01:03:04,790
well,
this is totally untenable.

1331
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:07,250
I cannot step over the body of yet 
another homeless person.

1332
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:08,533
I'm going to take this guy into my life.
He's going to come back to my hotel 

1333
01:03:10,131 --> 01:03:11,240
room.
I'm going to,

1334
01:03:11,241 --> 01:03:11,830
you know,
I,

1335
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:12,663
I've got to go to London in a week.
I'm going to figure out what to do with 

1336
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:16,970
this guy and get him in and it's going 
to be your whole project

1337
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:17,880
then a couple of times.
Yeah,

1338
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,310
it's complex.

1339
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,240
Yeah.
It's called [inaudible].

1340
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,200
So the reason why he's lying on the 
side,

1341
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,213
there are many reasons why he's lying on
the sidewalk and probably those reasons 

1342
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:29,150
aren't immediately actionable by you.
Um,

1343
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,713
now what we need is a system that 
recognizes the problem of homelessness 

1344
01:03:35,341 --> 01:03:39,360
in the most compassionate and pragmatic 
way and figures out what,

1345
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:41,040
whatever solution there is.
What,

1346
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:42,690
you know,
there's substance abuse issues,

1347
01:03:42,691 --> 01:03:44,610
there's mental health issues,
there's,

1348
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:46,610
there's zoning issues.
There's like,

1349
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:47,311
I mean,
we,

1350
01:03:47,311 --> 01:03:50,130
we the,
there's this not in my backyard ism that

1351
01:03:50,131 --> 01:03:50,964
where people are just getting pushed to 
different parts of the city because you 

1352
01:03:53,191 --> 01:03:55,680
don't see this in Beverly Hills,
but you see this in Santa Monica,

1353
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:59,040
right?
We have to figure out a solution that is

1354
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:00,720
compassionate and,
and

1355
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:03,820
so do you think poverty is the 
relegation of spiritual principles?

1356
01:04:03,821 --> 01:04:04,654
The fact that broadly speaking,
culturally spiritual principles and for 

1357
01:04:06,161 --> 01:04:08,560
been relegated to the point of almost 
insignificant.

1358
01:04:08,561 --> 01:04:09,394
So it's sort of no longer feels like a 
sort of a person or ge to help homeless 

1359
01:04:12,881 --> 01:04:13,714
people.
Of course as you set the systems aren't 

1360
01:04:14,801 --> 01:04:15,634
in place.
One wonders what would happen if I just 

1361
01:04:16,581 --> 01:04:18,740
sort of put him over my shoulder and 
tried to take him somewhere.

1362
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:22,630
I know it happened shelters would be 
full complex medical issues,

1363
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,673
issues of finance,
but then you think there's sort of this 

1364
01:04:25,931 --> 01:04:29,530
sort of idea of individual ism and 
individual freedom kind of relieved,

1365
01:04:29,531 --> 01:04:34,480
still sort of be somehow favors primal 
and selfish drives over sort of communal

1366
01:04:34,481 --> 01:04:37,060
fraternal drives.
And whilst I agree with you on that baby

1367
01:04:37,061 --> 01:04:40,600
bath water dynamic,
I don't think we do enough to,

1368
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:43,060
uh,
to focus on,

1369
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,900
uh,
luminate and present the baby,

1370
01:04:46,901 --> 01:04:48,270
the baby that is spirituality.

1371
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:49,830
That is,
you need to kind of things that we're,

1372
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,673
you know,
when you're meditating for two years in 

1373
01:04:51,461 --> 01:04:52,294
silence and when you're continuing to 
meditate now probably when you're doing 

1374
01:04:54,011 --> 01:04:56,590
Brazilian Jujitsu,
shrong senses or fraternity,

1375
01:04:56,591 --> 01:04:57,600
togetherness,
oneness.

1376
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:59,350
How do we,
for me,

1377
01:04:59,351 --> 01:05:01,600
I think that the pro,
the priority,

1378
01:05:01,601 --> 01:05:02,434
the most useful way of getting those 
values into our culture is to 

1379
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:09,430
demonstrate them to confront power where
possible and necessary.

1380
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:12,310
And it seems to me less significant.
And this is what I'm fascinated by,

1381
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:17,520
the to attack focus on the arguments 
that you have focusing on and

1382
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:18,963
arguments you've been brilliantly making
and pricing about sort of we sort of 

1383
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:21,994
sort of wonderfully pos or disagree is 
it has become evident on many of the 

1384
01:05:24,371 --> 01:05:26,470
tenets of it.
So that for me they,

1385
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,210
well I suppose what I'm saying,
it's all,

1386
01:05:28,211 --> 01:05:30,950
and people like you and I who believe in
spirituality,

1387
01:05:30,951 --> 01:05:31,784
you believe in compassion.
We believe in love be doing more to 

1388
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:35,943
elevate those values.
I'm doing that a lot when I talk about 

1389
01:05:42,461 --> 01:05:47,200
meditation and spirituality and 
wellbeing and ethics a lot is it got the

1390
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:48,640
highest base.
Got Behavioral.

1391
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:50,980
I know you have to be a chairman of that
deal with you know,

1392
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:53,090
secularism and all that kind of thing 
and of be like,

1393
01:05:53,091 --> 01:05:55,780
you know,
how does that convert into,

1394
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,340
you know,
bought a boots on the ground,

1395
01:05:57,341 --> 01:05:58,960
love for other humans?

1396
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:05,100
Well we do talk about what the ground 
truth is here,

1397
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:07,254
man.
We have consciousness and its contents 

1398
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:10,690
in each moment.
I mean that's,

1399
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,730
that's what our lives are.
We have,

1400
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:13,923
we have changing states of consciousness
and this is all there is to care about 

1401
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:22,020
is that all there is to care about our 
changes for good or for ill in conscious

1402
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:25,840
creatures like ourselves.
So if you love someone,

1403
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:30,400
you care that they be happy and that 
they no longer suffer or if they suffer,

1404
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,473
they suffer in ways that are productive,
that lead to an even deeper states of 

1405
01:06:34,271 --> 01:06:36,370
wellbeing.
It's not like we're just pure hedonists.

1406
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,553
There's this kinds of suffering that 
that lead lead that has a silver lining 

1407
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:41,643
that gets us somewhere worth going.
But when you're talking about finding 

1408
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:47,080
meaning in life and making meaning 
together in community,

1409
01:06:47,081 --> 01:06:50,920
you're talking about just what kind of,
what it's like to be you.

1410
01:06:50,921 --> 01:06:53,290
Are you talking about consciousness and 
we are.

1411
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:54,363
We are.
We actually know a lot about how to 

1412
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:58,713
improve states of human consciousness 
and creativity and aesthetic beauty and 

1413
01:07:05,231 --> 01:07:06,064
ethical interactions and not lying and 
treating people the way you would want 

1414
01:07:11,141 --> 01:07:12,580
to be treated.
Something like a precept,

1415
01:07:12,581 --> 01:07:14,680
like the golden rule.
Super useful.

1416
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:15,760
And as I can say,
that's a great,

1417
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:15,830
yeah.

1418
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:17,900
PC software under the heading of baby,
right?

1419
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:20,250
This,
this is okay.

1420
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:21,721
Yeah,
but you don't,

1421
01:07:21,721 --> 01:07:22,554
but they don't,
they don't only come from scripture and 

1422
01:07:23,701 --> 01:07:26,520
there people had these ideas outside of 
religious traditions.

1423
01:07:26,521 --> 01:07:28,580
You can find Greek philosophers who've 
said all this,

1424
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:30,390
right?
Yeah,

1425
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:31,020
but,
but,

1426
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,190
but nothing,
nothing has,

1427
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:36,510
nothing has to be believed on 
insufficient evidence to use these ideas

1428
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,750
and to find them compelling.
Yeah,

1429
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,593
no,
of course I agree with you or you don't 

1430
01:07:40,621 --> 01:07:41,454
have to all I believe that.
And there's a cost to believing any 

1431
01:07:44,671 --> 01:07:48,390
dogma that the problem is any dog,
any dogma,

1432
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,550
it's costly.
Well,

1433
01:07:50,551 --> 01:07:55,551
it depends what those look like.
They are the price.

1434
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:57,840
Now,
the collateral damage of our culture.

1435
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:58,793
Sam,
are you confident that individual 

1436
01:08:02,191 --> 01:08:03,024
consciousness,
like my individual Russell brand 

1437
01:08:04,561 --> 01:08:06,900
consciousness and your individual Sam 
Harris consciousness,

1438
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:08,123
are distinct,
separate things that are not 

1439
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:15,290
qualitatively similar,
if not ultimately the same?

1440
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:16,070
I

1441
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,903
know there is zero scientific evidence 
to suggest that all consciousness is 

1442
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,313
one,
but it would given you your research 

1443
01:08:23,211 --> 01:08:25,400
scientifically and personal,
spiritual,

1444
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,690
uh,
investigations.

1445
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,750
Is there anything that suggest to you 
that consciousness is a phenomena,

1446
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,220
maybe universal?

1447
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:35,490
Well,
it's universal in the sense that that is

1448
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:36,743
simply the fact of experience is that 
there's the fact that there's something 

1449
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:40,824
that is like to be you.
And there's something that has liked to 

1450
01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:47,160
be me.
And so it's almost analogous to space.

1451
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,230
It's like we,
it's like the space in this room,

1452
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:52,140
uh,
is,

1453
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:54,990
is seamless,
right?

1454
01:08:54,991 --> 01:08:56,700
And,
and undivided.

1455
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:57,930
And you ask yourself,
well,

1456
01:08:57,931 --> 01:08:59,700
so what,
what about the space?

1457
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:02,850
Like what about the space inside this 
water bottle?

1458
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:03,893
Well,
where's or what like where is the water 

1459
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,010
bottle with reference to space?
Well,

1460
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:10,170
it's the only place it can be.
It's,

1461
01:09:10,171 --> 01:09:11,004
it's,
it's right there where the water bottle 

1462
01:09:12,391 --> 01:09:13,620
is by move it,
it moves.

1463
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:15,290
But it's,
it's,

1464
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,193
there's no other place.
It's so to ask if you're asking about 

1465
01:09:18,961 --> 01:09:20,910
the space,
uh,

1466
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:22,223
it has,
it has a kind of sameness regardless of 

1467
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:27,840
what object in that space you're talking
about.

1468
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:30,990
And consciousness has that property,
at least conceptually.

1469
01:09:30,991 --> 01:09:35,610
Now we don't know how consciousness 
arises in the physics of things.

1470
01:09:35,611 --> 01:09:38,200
We don't know if it's a product of,
of,

1471
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,133
yeah.
I mean there's certainly good reason to 

1472
01:09:40,921 --> 01:09:43,410
believe that it is,
but we don't know how far down it goes.

1473
01:09:43,411 --> 01:09:44,244
It's probably could be a fundamental 
constituent of matter or it could arise 

1474
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,380
on the basis of assemblies of neurons.
Yep.

1475
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,550
The good reason to believe that it comes
from Matt,

1476
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:52,493
that the more complex an organism is,
the more evidence of functioning 

1477
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,520
rational consciousness there is.
He's

1478
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:57,703
Wa it's a me,
just again here you sort of start the 

1479
01:10:02,711 --> 01:10:05,530
universe from the big bang.
Right.

1480
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:08,410
And the idea that,
um,

1481
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:10,143
I mean we,
we find complex arrangements of matter 

1482
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:14,733
giving rise to different emergent 
properties and life is one of those 

1483
01:10:17,621 --> 01:10:18,640
properties.
And you know,

1484
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,130
and all of the features of life,
reproduction and,

1485
01:10:21,131 --> 01:10:23,270
and,
and metabolism and,

1486
01:10:23,271 --> 01:10:24,490
and,
uh,

1487
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,830
the,
the order we see in,

1488
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:30,880
in the natural world is the result of a 
process of increasing complexity.

1489
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:36,700
And at the end of some significant 
period,

1490
01:10:36,701 --> 01:10:37,600
I mean,
in our case,

1491
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:38,830
you know,
billions of years,

1492
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:44,070
you find organisms that exhibit the 
properties of consciousness,

1493
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,440
but that,
but the only,

1494
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:50,441
the only consciousness we're sure of 
100% sure of is the consciousness in our

1495
01:10:51,101 --> 01:10:53,170
own case.
Now we can reason by analogy.

1496
01:10:53,171 --> 01:10:56,680
We look at dogs and other complex 
animals.

1497
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:58,030
And we can say,
well,

1498
01:10:58,390 --> 01:10:59,223
to imagine that,
that they don't have consciousness but 

1499
01:11:02,111 --> 01:11:03,340
only seemed to have it.

1500
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:06,560
That's actually not parsimonious.
And because I mean,

1501
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,530
they're so similar to us,
you know,

1502
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,393
neurologically and in every other way 
that to imagine that the lights come on 

1503
01:11:12,791 --> 01:11:16,650
somewhere between them and us seems 
irrational.

1504
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:19,620
But how far down that goes is anybody's 
guess.

1505
01:11:19,621 --> 01:11:21,690
And intuitions really divides.
If you ask,

1506
01:11:21,691 --> 01:11:24,420
most neuroscientists are philosophers of
mind,

1507
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:28,350
is there something that is like to be a 
fly?

1508
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,730
Right?
This got 100,000

1509
01:11:29,731 --> 01:11:31,740
neurons in his brain.
Um,

1510
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:33,230
people just,
you know,

1511
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:36,470
it's that kind of coin toss right now.
I think there is,

1512
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,120
um,
again,

1513
01:11:39,121 --> 01:11:41,930
so it could be,
again,

1514
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:42,764
we,
we simply don't know at what point 

1515
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:45,440
consciousness emerges and,
but it's,

1516
01:11:45,441 --> 01:11:49,110
it's possible that single cells are 
conscious in some way.

1517
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:49,670
Right?
I mean that's,

1518
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:51,960
that like that wouldn't,
you wouldn't expect the,

1519
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:52,913
the,
the living world to appear differently 

1520
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,760
if cells were conscious.
Right.

1521
01:11:57,170 --> 01:11:58,310
Um,
but it is,

1522
01:11:58,311 --> 01:12:01,320
it would be genuinely mysterious because
when you look at the human brain,

1523
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:05,280
there seems to be a lot of neural 
activity.

1524
01:12:05,281 --> 01:12:06,114
In fact,
most neural activity that is not 

1525
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:08,514
associated with what you experience as 
consciousness or I experienced as 

1526
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:14,400
consciousness from a first person side.
So

1527
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,890
what motion you're activity is not 
related to yeah,

1528
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,670
most,
most anatomical biological stuff.

1529
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:20,250
Yeah.
I mean,

1530
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,083
yeah,
most of what your brain is doing isn't 

1531
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:27,720
showing up in your first person 
experience as conscious

1532
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,160
at that age.
Just like a cherry on the cake,

1533
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:32,350
the kidneys in the plan.
But it's the,

1534
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:33,660
but it's the,

1535
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:35,040
the thing that ultimately matters,
right?

1536
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:35,900
I mean,
so the content and,

1537
01:12:35,901 --> 01:12:40,901
and it's the only thing that,
that any of us can be absolutely sure of

1538
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:41,843
and said this is,
this is my line about consciousness 

1539
01:12:43,741 --> 01:12:46,230
being the only thing in the universe 
that can't be an illusion.

1540
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:47,423
I'm not that,
I'm not the first person to say this 

1541
01:12:48,121 --> 01:12:49,350
obviously,
but the,

1542
01:12:49,351 --> 01:12:53,970
um,
it's the only thing that is,

1543
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:58,620
has to be true of us no matter how 
mistaken we might be a better everything

1544
01:12:58,621 --> 01:12:59,330
else.
So if this,

1545
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:01,350
if we're on in the matrix right now,
and this is just a,

1546
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,213
you know,
we're just living in a simulation on 

1547
01:13:03,301 --> 01:13:08,301
some alien supercomputer and none of 
what we think is real is actually real.

1548
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:11,550
Consciousness is still real.
And the consciousness is just simply the

1549
01:13:11,551 --> 01:13:13,800
fact that anything seems to be happening
at all.

1550
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:14,993
Or if you're really asleep and dreaming 
right now and we're not really doing 

1551
01:13:17,191 --> 01:13:18,024
this podcast,
you're totally confused about your 

1552
01:13:20,071 --> 01:13:20,904
actual circumstance.
But you're actually not confused about 

1553
01:13:22,351 --> 01:13:23,370
the fact that your conscious,

1554
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:24,303
oh,
that would explain why I've got no 

1555
01:13:24,681 --> 01:13:27,760
trousers and pants.
I was,

1556
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:31,900
I was hoping you had trousers.
Like,

1557
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:34,100
see how you just described 
consciousness,

1558
01:13:34,101 --> 01:13:34,934
then it's potentially sort of a 
construction then suddenly up personal 

1559
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:39,500
consciousness that we can be set and is 
not an illusion.

1560
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,300
Many of you know about,
you know,

1561
01:13:41,301 --> 01:13:44,180
sort of the Mahara Mahabharata and the 
back of our Gita and many of these ideas

1562
01:13:44,181 --> 01:13:49,181
are sort of using a vernacular that is 
naturally termin by the time in which it

1563
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:52,124
was conceived.
It talks about these ideas that mayor 

1564
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,200
illusion,
uh,

1565
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:57,020
that and,
and,

1566
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:57,853
and for me like that because of like,
like he also said that list of values 

1567
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:04,650
that would be useful and which I've 
said,

1568
01:14:04,651 --> 01:14:06,470
oh,
well they have their part of the baby in

1569
01:14:06,471 --> 01:14:07,520
the bath water,
aren't they?

1570
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,290
It seems to me that possibly within,
uh,

1571
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:15,320
like if can somehow extract what is 
positive from a,

1572
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:18,220
what is called religion,
that it might,

1573
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:22,330
it leads us to ideas such as fraternity,
unity,

1574
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:25,290
oneness,
compassion and like with the,

1575
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:27,760
or do you not find,
uh,

1576
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,633
I,
and now connections between what you 

1577
01:14:31,851 --> 01:14:32,684
have learned in neuroscience and what 
you've learned from studying sort of 

1578
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:36,070
Buddhism.

1579
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:38,760
Oh yeah.
The connections are very direct,

1580
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:39,643
but

1581
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:40,850
how'd they know that stuff?

1582
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:41,763
But we,
but we don't want well but just because 

1583
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:47,680
it's,
it's just the nature of consciousness is

1584
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:48,653
you,
you're talking about people who have 

1585
01:14:49,211 --> 01:14:51,580
spent,
especially in the Buddhist case,

1586
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:55,790
I just an incredible amount of time 
studying from aunt,

1587
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:58,240
from the first person side.
What experiences,

1588
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:01,810
like what his character is,
what one analogy would be.

1589
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,260
Um,
the central,

1590
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:08,680
the central claim of Buddhism is not 
just Buddhism but,

1591
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,633
but um,
Buddhism and I would put several of the 

1592
01:15:13,211 --> 01:15:16,790
Indian traditions like Advaita Vedanta 
in there with the central claims at the,

1593
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:20,190
the self is an illusion.
The EGO is an illusion.

1594
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,280
Where,
and when I say self,

1595
01:15:21,281 --> 01:15:22,114
I don't mean that people are illusions.
I mean that the sense that you have a 

1596
01:15:25,091 --> 01:15:28,730
subject riding around in your head 
thinking your thoughts right there.

1597
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:30,700
That there's a thinker in addition to 
the thoughts.

1598
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:35,140
That's an illusion.
And that makes perfect sense.

1599
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:36,460
Neurologically,
there's no,

1600
01:15:36,461 --> 01:15:39,370
there's no place in the brain for your 
ego to be sitting.

1601
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:41,980
There's no central place where 
everything comes together.

1602
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:44,830
There's no unchanging center in the 
brain.

1603
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:45,903
You're just talking about a cascade of 
neurophysiology and everything is 

1604
01:15:48,821 --> 01:15:52,450
distributed everywhere and it's not a,
and there are various parts of the brain

1605
01:15:52,451 --> 01:15:54,100
that are coming online and off and,
and,

1606
01:15:54,101 --> 01:15:57,250
and subserving conscious dates and not,
it's,

1607
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:01,720
it's a,
it's a process and there is there if you

1608
01:16:01,721 --> 01:16:02,554
could experience consciousness as a flow
of sensory and emotional and 

1609
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:11,374
interoceptive experience without a,
the sense that there's an unchanging 

1610
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:19,810
center riding around on that flow,
right?

1611
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,630
Like a man in a boat on the,
on the stream of consciousness.

1612
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:24,520
Yes.
Um,

1613
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,700
if you could experience that 
consciousness without that,

1614
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,373
that would be an experience that is much
more coincident with what we understand 

1615
01:16:33,941 --> 01:16:34,774
neurologically it that would be,
that would be to experience something 

1616
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:41,800
that is more true from the third person 
brain-based,

1617
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:44,140
what do we see inside the head side?

1618
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,240
And it just so happens you can't 
experience that.

1619
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,103
That is just,
that is how that is what meditation is 

1620
01:16:48,761 --> 01:16:50,470
like when you really know how to 
meditate.

1621
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:51,663
This sense that there's a meditator in 
the head strategically paying attention 

1622
01:16:56,590 --> 01:17:00,340
to experience rather than just pure 
experience that drops away.

1623
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:00,911
Right.
So that's,

1624
01:17:00,911 --> 01:17:03,580
this is one,
that's one piece of data in favor of,

1625
01:17:03,581 --> 01:17:06,040
of the,
of introspection here.

1626
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:07,263
And it's not,
it's not a piece that the western 

1627
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:13,550
intellectual tradition or the West or 
the western spiritual tradition ever got

1628
01:17:13,551 --> 01:17:15,170
a good hand handle on.
I mean,

1629
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:16,013
so yes,
you can find specific Christian and 

1630
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:20,660
Jewish and Muslim mystics making these 
noises,

1631
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:21,793
but they make the,
when they make these noises 

1632
01:17:22,641 --> 01:17:23,474
sufficiently,
they start to sound like Buddhists and 

1633
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:27,710
their co-religionists want to kill them 
rather often.

1634
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:32,280
The religionists the powerful,
uh,

1635
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:35,510
and ease within nation states and 
economic life.

1636
01:17:35,511 --> 01:17:37,010
People start believing they're not 
individuals.

1637
01:17:37,011 --> 01:17:38,420
It's very out to market at them.

1638
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:40,940
Yeah.
But we haven't had a lot of problems,

1639
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:44,360
people with people being killed for not 
doing enough shopping and shopping malls

1640
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,433
because,
cause I,

1641
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:46,533
unless there's a shoe in,
in the shopping mall and that's the 

1642
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,770
stuff they buy in the shopping mall,
kill some.

1643
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:49,980
Yeah,

1644
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:50,813
I looked.
But if you look at the history of 

1645
01:17:51,341 --> 01:17:55,360
Christianity and Judaism and Islam,
you find people who,

1646
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:56,723
I mean,
these are explicitly dualistic 

1647
01:17:57,731 --> 01:17:59,290
traditions.
You have a soul,

1648
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:00,213
you have a soul that exists in 
relationship to the divine and that 

1649
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:06,183
division,

1650
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:08,800
it's maintain the theological,
I would say sam high risk.

1651
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:09,723
The reason that bifurcation occurred is 
precisely because I wear man's 

1652
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:16,004
relationship with the divine prioritized
in the manner that you've just been 

1653
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:23,510
describing.
That seems a neurologically Apisai where

1654
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,960
that to become our priority and 
materialistic,

1655
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:27,823
let's call it lifestyle and mechanistic,
social mechanistic social systems such 

1656
01:18:32,031 --> 01:18:34,760
as the ones that we inhabit would be 
less,

1657
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:36,290
uh,
fertile.

1658
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,153
Because if people believed that the 
ultimate reality was not being 

1659
01:18:39,441 --> 01:18:43,310
experienced by the self,
that there was no self that,

1660
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:45,440
that,
that and binds us,

1661
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,393
that makes oneness a real possibility.
That starts to suggest that your 

1662
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:51,890
consciousness and my consciousness 
ultimately are the same.

1663
01:18:51,891 --> 01:18:53,780
Or at least there's nothing to suggest 
that there are any different.

1664
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:55,850
And that the things that we believe to 
be different,

1665
01:18:55,851 --> 01:18:57,220
a superficial,
uh,

1666
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,080
accents acquired through culture,

1667
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,980
that's also true materially.
And I,

1668
01:19:01,981 --> 01:19:02,814
and we shouldn't give the material short
trip because the material progress is 

1669
01:19:08,301 --> 01:19:12,470
the thing that frees attention to,
I mean,

1670
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:13,470
so I mean,
just,

1671
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:18,550
you roll back the clock long enough,
you find people living in just perpetual

1672
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:22,940
states of trying not to die,
right?

1673
01:19:22,941 --> 01:19:24,250
And you're like,
you know,

1674
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,300
you're,
you're fending off wild animals.

1675
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:28,870
You're exposed to the elements.
You're,

1676
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:29,733
you're,
you're suffering the consequences of 

1677
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:33,470
disease and you have no concept of what 
disease is,

1678
01:19:33,471 --> 01:19:34,304
right?
You don't know about the germ theory of 

1679
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:39,220
disease and you and your child dies and 
you think it's because the,

1680
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:43,460
your neighbor,
she shined the evil eye on the child,

1681
01:19:43,461 --> 01:19:43,761
right?
I mean,

1682
01:19:43,761 --> 01:19:44,390
so it's like,
it's,

1683
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:48,170
you have magical beliefs accounting for 
changes in the world and they're,

1684
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:50,030
they're completely fallacious,
right?

1685
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:54,980
So the progress we've made in 
understanding that the material world is

1686
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:55,814
all to the good,
except we have all of these misaligned 

1687
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:02,520
incentive problems and,
um,

1688
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:06,920
externalized damages to two very good 
things and be like,

1689
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,250
you want an iphone.

1690
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,113
Right?
But you don't want people jumping off 

1691
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:12,750
the roof of foxconn because life is 
such,

1692
01:20:12,751 --> 01:20:15,120
it's so painful they're being to,
to make an iphone.

1693
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:16,120
Right.
Um,

1694
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:21,500
so is it possible to make an iphone 
without creating just unendurable misery

1695
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:24,210
for some number of people?
Undoubtedly.

1696
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,860
It must be true,
right?

1697
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:28,230
We haven't,
we haven't figured it out yet.

1698
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:29,543
Uh,
so as to make that the default and we 

1699
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:35,680
need to do that.
But we,

1700
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:36,600
you know,
there's nothing,

1701
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:40,223
there is no,
there is no distance between the 

1702
01:20:41,881 --> 01:20:43,700
material and the spiritual here.
I mean,

1703
01:20:43,701 --> 01:20:46,290
so cause if consciousness is just a 
matter of,

1704
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:49,890
of information processing in,
in the,

1705
01:20:49,891 --> 01:20:50,724
the right complex systems and if 
consciousness could one day be born in 

1706
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:54,780
our computers,
right,

1707
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:56,710
well then we'll have an ethical 
obligation to,

1708
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:59,010
to not make our computer suffer.
Right.

1709
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,230
If Siri could suffer,
right,

1710
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:03,240
well then it matters how you talk to 
her,

1711
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:05,850
you know,
and it would matter every,

1712
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,950
oh yeah,
I want to complicate life.

1713
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:14,100
Um,
and we're not obviously not there yet or

1714
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:15,960
it certainly seems obvious that we're 
not there yet,

1715
01:21:15,961 --> 01:21:16,794
but at a certain point we will very 
likely either be in the presence of 

1716
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:23,910
conscious machines or think we are 
right.

1717
01:21:23,911 --> 01:21:24,744
We'll lose sight of the they'll,
they'll emulate conscious systems in a 

1718
01:21:27,991 --> 01:21:30,900
compelling enough way that our default 
will be,

1719
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:34,490
I'm in relationship to this thing now.
And,

1720
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:39,360
and to withdraw a sense of consciousness
in that case would seem,

1721
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:40,613
um,
just unprincipled and unethical and 

1722
01:21:42,721 --> 01:21:43,440
we'll have,
we'll have,

1723
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:43,920
we,
we,

1724
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:44,753
we,
we could well build machines that seem 

1725
01:21:48,011 --> 01:21:48,844
to have emotional lives and even have 
more richer emotional lives than we do 

1726
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:55,230
because they're going to have access to 
all of human knowledge,

1727
01:21:55,231 --> 01:21:56,940
all of human,
uh,

1728
01:21:56,941 --> 01:22:01,470
all of the aesthetic products of,
of human ingenuity for all of history.

1729
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:02,753
And they'll be able to talk about them 
and appreciate them and remind you of 

1730
01:22:05,461 --> 01:22:06,294
how much you love certain things and,
and react to your emotion faster and 

1731
01:22:11,881 --> 01:22:15,210
more accurately than your best friends 
or your or your spouse.

1732
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:16,370
Right.
We could bill,

1733
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,233
ultimately,
we will very likely build these 

1734
01:22:17,971 --> 01:22:18,804
machines.
And if we have an understood how 

1735
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:22,350
consciousness arises in physical 
systems,

1736
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:25,860
will think they're conscious and we will
maybe right or wrong about that.

1737
01:22:25,861 --> 01:22:26,694
And,
and whether we're right or wrong about 

1738
01:22:28,231 --> 01:22:31,310
that will be a huge consequence because,
you know,

1739
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,060
it would be,
it would be,

1740
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:34,790
uh,
um,

1741
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:36,953
it would be an absolutely abhorrent act 
to build conscious systems that can 

1742
01:22:41,401 --> 01:22:44,660
suffer in ways we don't even understand.
And just,

1743
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:46,490
just to cavalierly,
you know,

1744
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:49,020
spawn this off in simulations and,
you know,

1745
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:52,590
on the Amazon cloud and not know what 
the hell we're doing.

1746
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:55,710
For me that of course we've already 
created like the,

1747
01:22:55,750 --> 01:23:00,120
this is not just a hypothesis because 
already all around us as we've already,

1748
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:02,220
fleetingly discussed,
lie scattered,

1749
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:03,323
they're damaged and broken and 
presumably conscious entities that are 

1750
01:23:06,521 --> 01:23:09,140
fellow human beings,
our fellow English,

1751
01:23:09,141 --> 01:23:09,974
but in America,
Americans scattered and broken around 

1752
01:23:12,881 --> 01:23:13,930
us.
And Sam,

1753
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:14,963
uh,
so for me there's two points to Raha 

1754
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:18,040
cause we've got a much longer than I 
intended to.

1755
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:19,640
Sure.
It was trippy how like,

1756
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:20,890
uh,
like,

1757
01:23:20,891 --> 01:23:21,570
you know,
there's,

1758
01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:23,050
there's quite a lot of questions still.

1759
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,120
I'm,
I'm fine on time so you can just,

1760
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,190
I'll see if I can do as one tumble 
dryer,

1761
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:32,750
one s whirling neurological sprawl.
One evening

1762
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,160
we stick regurgitation.
Uh,

1763
01:23:35,161 --> 01:23:37,770
in your general direction.
Here are the things that interest me.

1764
01:23:37,771 --> 01:23:40,800
One on a podcast I was listening to you 
do once a like an,

1765
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:41,713
it's a,
it's an idea that sort of more commonly 

1766
01:23:43,231 --> 01:23:46,890
understood that possibly freewill is an 
illusion that decisions are made prior.

1767
01:23:46,891 --> 01:23:51,891
So morality and ethics sort of suffer 
some what if that's true too?

1768
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:57,370
I don't think that final part holds are 
person.

1769
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:02,980
Or you can have your morality and ethics
without free will.

1770
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:05,520
Can I have morality and ethics without 
free?

1771
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:07,080
But they roll it by the way.

1772
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,380
Evaluate them.
Has to be sort of looked at differently.

1773
01:24:09,381 --> 01:24:11,690
Do it in one big,
let me do my vomit.

1774
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:15,740
Girlfriend used to use back.
Yours is more piecemeal.

1775
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:16,663
Mine's a sort of a literal slu.
Yours says it has all sorts of 

1776
01:24:19,611 --> 01:24:22,540
rationalism and academia to bill on 
this.

1777
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:24,620
Of a what?
Minecraft.

1778
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:27,000
A beautiful architecture.
Um,

1779
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,780
so Sam Harris,
the other thing is when you were a,

1780
01:24:29,781 --> 01:24:30,614
when you've taken psychedelics,
did you not experience a things that 

1781
01:24:34,221 --> 01:24:35,054
comparable to what you described is 
neurologically demonstrable and what 

1782
01:24:38,511 --> 01:24:39,530
you've experienced in,
in,

1783
01:24:39,531 --> 01:24:42,920
in meditation,
I sense that your individual identity is

1784
01:24:42,921 --> 01:24:43,754
a sort of,
uh,

1785
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,823
uh,
confection of sort of ideas and 

1786
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,680
sensation and that there isn't sort of 
a,

1787
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:52,260
a beautiful oneness.
I myself taking Alicia,

1788
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:53,870
Jenny,
I'm clean now for 15 years,

1789
01:24:53,871 --> 01:24:55,850
but prior to that,
when I used to take hallucinogens,

1790
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:57,103
the thing I didn't have the vocabulary,
artillery or education to understand 

1791
01:25:01,431 --> 01:25:02,510
what,
what the hell was going on.

1792
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:03,343
And I wish I'd been born into some sort 
of shamanic tradition where people 

1793
01:25:05,391 --> 01:25:07,790
taught you what spirit is.
When they tell you what it used to be,

1794
01:25:07,791 --> 01:25:08,780
a man,
what they're taught you,

1795
01:25:08,781 --> 01:25:09,614
what love is,
and how to behave and how to create 

1796
01:25:11,151 --> 01:25:15,320
systems and how to father a daughter and
how to take care of regardless.

1797
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,540
I experienced something within my 
identity.

1798
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:21,170
I seemingly be on my identity as a 16 
year old boy.

1799
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:22,370
I remember thinking,
Oh my God,

1800
01:25:22,371 --> 01:25:25,550
this is not who I am.
I am not this body.

1801
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:26,563
My consciousness is other than this in 
temporarily individuated form that only 

1802
01:25:33,381 --> 01:25:34,530
the distinction.
And uh,

1803
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:35,530
you know,
even just on the,

1804
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:38,810
on a physics level,
like everything was one,

1805
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:39,763
everything is expanding.
I am only experiencing time in an 

1806
01:25:42,921 --> 01:25:43,754
animalistic way because of my own 
entropy and atrophy where I are 

1807
01:25:47,421 --> 01:25:52,421
limitless in a terminal material being,
I would see myself as part of the whole,

1808
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,473
as part of oneness because the way that 
I narrativize my life is as a result of 

1809
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:02,960
biocentric experience as opposed to 
objective experience.

1810
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:07,610
I've just been subjected to this stimuli
and I've built an identity around it.

1811
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:11,660
It felt extremely true and it stayed 
with me ever since.

1812
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:14,500
And I've revisited it through meditation
there.

1813
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:16,160
Uh,
aside from it being a,

1814
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:20,240
an interesting experience intellectually
is an interesting experience emotionally

1815
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:21,103
and spiritually.
And if this sense of oneness does not 

1816
01:26:23,601 --> 01:26:27,500
translate into a sort of a personal 
ethical code,

1817
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:31,460
that means I treat people lovingly.
What is its value?

1818
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:33,680
So it's two questions.
Have you experienced that state and what

1819
01:26:33,681 --> 01:26:36,950
do you think of it are moral and ethical
implications on an individual?

1820
01:26:36,951 --> 01:26:39,130
And what does it,
how does it translate into behavior?

1821
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:39,810
Well,
well,

1822
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:41,970
there are two states I would want to 
differentiate.

1823
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:43,143
There are two ways in which you can 
think about the loss of self and the 

1824
01:26:46,711 --> 01:26:48,090
sense of oneness.
So,

1825
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,250
um,
with psychedelics,

1826
01:26:50,251 --> 01:26:53,010
you get to come back to what I said 
before.

1827
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:55,170
You have consciousness and its contents,
right?

1828
01:26:55,171 --> 01:26:56,004
There's just,
there's the fact that things are 

1829
01:26:57,511 --> 01:26:58,344
appearing.
There was the fact that there is 

1830
01:26:59,251 --> 01:27:04,251
experience and consciousness is the 
knowing aspect of experience.

1831
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:08,310
And nor in the normal course of events 
you have,

1832
01:27:08,311 --> 01:27:09,144
you know,
ordinary sights and sounds and smells 

1833
01:27:10,471 --> 01:27:13,020
and sensations and thoughts and 
emotions.

1834
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:17,220
And you go through,
and most people go through life thinking

1835
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,980
every moment of the day in the car,
in that context.

1836
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:21,510
And they don't know how to meditate.
They don't know.

1837
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,580
They don't have any mindfulness.
Uh,

1838
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:24,473
they have this sort of white noise of 
discursivity where they're talking to 

1839
01:27:27,421 --> 01:27:29,940
themselves and everything they see and,
and,

1840
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:31,020
and sense.

1841
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:35,250
And every interaction is filtered 
through this conversation they're having

1842
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:39,480
with themselves and the world they see 
visually and,

1843
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:42,260
and uh,
uh,

1844
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:43,830
you know,
the world they sense with,

1845
01:27:43,831 --> 01:27:44,664
you know,
with touch and other senses is tiled 

1846
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:48,280
over with concepts.
So you,

1847
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:50,070
I,
I look at a bottle and I see bottle,

1848
01:27:50,071 --> 01:27:51,060
right?
I'm not the,

1849
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:53,970
this,
this field of light and shadow and color

1850
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:57,030
is differentiated by concepts.
I see my phone,

1851
01:27:57,031 --> 01:27:57,864
I see a bottle,
I see the table and everything is 

1852
01:27:59,911 --> 01:28:00,744
solidified that way.
Now what happens with psychedelics is 

1853
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:05,123
your,
your habit pattern of thought and 

1854
01:28:08,161 --> 01:28:13,161
attention is completely bowled over by 
the pharmacology of whatever you've just

1855
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:14,001
ingested,
right?

1856
01:28:14,001 --> 01:28:17,670
So if it's acid or mushrooms or,
um,

1857
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:21,840
any of those classic psychedelics,
it's just whoever you are,

1858
01:28:21,841 --> 01:28:23,910
whatever your talents are at 
introspection,

1859
01:28:23,911 --> 01:28:26,790
we know whether you've ever wanted to 
meditate or not.

1860
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,033
Um,
you are guaranteed to have a change in 

1861
01:28:30,991 --> 01:28:31,710
your experience.

1862
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:33,510
If you take a sufficient dose of a 
psychedelic.

1863
01:28:33,511 --> 01:28:35,970
Now it can be a very chaotic and 
unpleasant change.

1864
01:28:35,971 --> 01:28:37,890
You can,
it can mimic psychosis right there.

1865
01:28:37,891 --> 01:28:38,724
You can,
a bad acid trip is really bad and not 

1866
01:28:41,311 --> 01:28:44,010
spiritually uplifting at all.
Uh,

1867
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:44,873
but a good one can put you in a state 
which is just unimaginably expansive 

1868
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:53,220
where it like all of this,
then the normal,

1869
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:57,480
uh,
pro kind of perceptual categories and,

1870
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:01,860
and emotional barriers between you and 
the world breakdown.

1871
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,053
And there can be this kind of like just 
this free as free flowing exchange of 

1872
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:08,940
energy and sense of oneness the way,
or you can,

1873
01:29:08,941 --> 01:29:11,850
you know,
you touch a tree with your hand and the,

1874
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:12,810
and the,
and the,

1875
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:14,690
the,
there's,

1876
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:15,563
there can be kind of a laser like 
concentration in the sensation of just 

1877
01:29:20,341 --> 01:29:22,710
having your hand make contact with the 
tree.

1878
01:29:22,711 --> 01:29:25,290
And they can be just as the sense of 
just,

1879
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,400
you know,
the energy,

1880
01:29:26,401 --> 01:29:29,250
the energy of that touch,
right.

1881
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:31,160
Can become,
it's like you turn,

1882
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:32,013
you're turning up the volume on this 
channel of information and making it 

1883
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:37,470
conscious in a way that it never is in,
in normal life.

1884
01:29:37,471 --> 01:29:38,304
And so you just,
you could spend two hours just in this 

1885
01:29:40,201 --> 01:29:44,730
kind of orgasmic union with a tree,
right?

1886
01:29:44,731 --> 01:29:47,590
I on the right drug now,
um,

1887
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:50,310
you can do all,
you can have all of those changes happen

1888
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:52,110
in your consciousness.
You know,

1889
01:29:52,111 --> 01:29:52,944
like the full pyrotechnics of a 
psychedelic display without losing the 

1890
01:29:58,141 --> 01:30:01,250
sense of an ego you can actually have at
all.

1891
01:30:01,290 --> 01:30:02,123
You can still feel that there,
that you are the center of that and 

1892
01:30:04,141 --> 01:30:04,974
you're just,
you're just,

1893
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:07,220
it's just so much better.
Uh,

1894
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:08,490
or in the chaotic,
you know,

1895
01:30:08,491 --> 01:30:11,610
psychotics side,
so much worse to be you at that moment.

1896
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:16,060
Now for me,
meditation has a very,

1897
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:17,263
if,
if you,

1898
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,380
if you go an intensive retreat and 
you're spending,

1899
01:30:19,381 --> 01:30:21,720
you know,
12 to 18 hours a day meditating,

1900
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:25,380
you can have psychedelic light changes 
in the contents of consciousness.

1901
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:26,543
But the more important change for me is 
the insight that there is no center to 

1902
01:30:30,661 --> 01:30:31,494
consciousness,
that there was simply is consciousness 

1903
01:30:33,001 --> 01:30:36,450
and everything appearing.
And when you have that insight,

1904
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:39,600
it actually doesn't matter what is 
appearing.

1905
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:42,420
It doesn't matter if you,
when you touch the tree,

1906
01:30:42,421 --> 01:30:44,010
it feels like,
you know,

1907
01:30:44,011 --> 01:30:48,900
a million watts of,
of sublime energy and there's no barrier

1908
01:30:48,901 --> 01:30:51,070
between unit you and the tree,
uh,

1909
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:53,400
that is the same on some fundamental 
level.

1910
01:30:53,401 --> 01:30:54,234
That's the same as just seeing a water 
bottle and picking it up and having a 

1911
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:01,410
drink in a completely otherwise ordinary
state of consciousness.

1912
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:06,960
The center can drop out equally or be 
present equally in both of those cases.

1913
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:10,470
And I'm much more interested in finding 
this,

1914
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,333
this unifying experience of centerless 
snus in the midst of whatever's 

1915
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:19,430
happening.
And because of the,

1916
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,700
the problem with the psychedelic 
experience or,

1917
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:24,990
or any peak experiences that is that 
they come and go,

1918
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:25,520
they're there.

1919
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,180
They're by nature,
impermanent,

1920
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:27,651
right.
And they,

1921
01:31:27,651 --> 01:31:28,484
they,
you had to bring some causes and 

1922
01:31:30,691 --> 01:31:31,524
conditions together to make them happen.
Whether they're pharmacological or 

1923
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:36,890
Meditational,
you know,

1924
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:37,733
he had to go on retreat for a year and,
and meditate 18 hours a day in order to 

1925
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:41,780
see those,
you know,

1926
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:44,010
in or lights or whatever it was.
Um,

1927
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:45,600
and or you had to,
you know,

1928
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:49,920
kind of blow your mind on acid and be 
kind of useless for the rest of the day.

1929
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,770
Um,
uh,

1930
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:53,230
in order to have that,
it,

1931
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:54,323
it's possible to have no ego and have 
none of the problems which an ego gives 

1932
01:32:01,331 --> 01:32:06,180
you in a state of otherwise totally 
ordinary consciousness in it,

1933
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:08,590
in a state that's compatible with having
this conversation.

1934
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:09,673
It's just you either feel like there's 
someone behind your face in this moment 

1935
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:16,630
or not.
That's really what it is.

1936
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:19,270
Like it's like if you're looking at me 
and I'm looking at you,

1937
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:22,420
the usual,
the default state of consciousness is to

1938
01:32:22,421 --> 01:32:27,421
feel like you're behind your face 
looking out at a world that's not self.

1939
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:29,403
Like you're over there,
you're kind of behind the mask that is 

1940
01:32:31,061 --> 01:32:35,410
your face and you're looking at me and 
that's the end.

1941
01:32:35,411 --> 01:32:38,260
And when I look at you,
when I react to something you say,

1942
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:38,900
right?
When I say,

1943
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:40,760
well,
that's clearly bullshit way,

1944
01:32:40,761 --> 01:32:41,594
hey,
you haven't thought that through that 

1945
01:32:42,371 --> 01:32:45,660
feeling of you know,
my point in it like this,

1946
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:47,740
you're implicated over there,
right?

1947
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:50,980
And you begin to react based on that 
implication.

1948
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:55,810
It's possible a lose that and to have 
like just just the world remains and yet

1949
01:32:55,811 --> 01:32:58,510
nothing else changes their doesn't.
There's no strange lights.

1950
01:32:58,511 --> 01:33:01,690
There's no Kundalini in the body.
There's nothing.

1951
01:33:01,691 --> 01:33:06,460
Nothing has to get weird or psychedelic 
and uh,

1952
01:33:06,461 --> 01:33:08,010
it doesn't matter if it does get weird.

1953
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,353
No and I please know you'll write that 
there is a of if there is no pragmatism 

1954
01:33:12,991 --> 01:33:13,824
to spirituality,
if there isn't a practical application 

1955
01:33:16,711 --> 01:33:20,130
to these extreme experiences within 
consciousness,

1956
01:33:20,131 --> 01:33:20,964
then what is their value?
My feeling is is that the sort of 

1957
01:33:24,830 --> 01:33:29,830
linguistics and grammar of mechanics,
the apparent separateness,

1958
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:35,130
the meaning of gesture,
they're very notion of you and die.

1959
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,370
There are moments where I experienced it
as temporal.

1960
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:42,690
There are moments where to use the Great
Bill Hicks is I think perfect phrase.

1961
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:47,720
I feel that we are one consciousness 
experiencing itself subjectively.

1962
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:53,900
When you talk about the loss of the 
being behind the mask of the face for me

1963
01:33:57,870 --> 01:33:58,703
this is,
we are talking about enlightenment and 

1964
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:02,133
[inaudible].
Are you talking about rather ascetic 

1965
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,153
version of that without bells and 
whistles and pyrotechnics to use your 

1966
01:34:09,511 --> 01:34:10,344
earlier phrase.
But similarly when you talk about the 

1967
01:34:11,581 --> 01:34:12,414
Psychedelic,
that sort of very emotional description 

1968
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,740
of connection and love.

1969
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:17,933
For me,
these are the kinds of experiences that 

1970
01:34:21,301 --> 01:34:26,301
we need to convey into an environment 
that deprived of that kind of experience

1971
01:34:27,151 --> 01:34:30,960
and understanding create maximum 
security prisons,

1972
01:34:30,961 --> 01:34:35,961
which find further means for degradation
in gangs and separation.

1973
01:34:36,151 --> 01:34:36,984
Once within that we are living perhaps 
in a time that is for me to turn it 

1974
01:34:40,891 --> 01:34:45,891
around by the extraction of the 
spiritual as opposed to the,

1975
01:34:47,790 --> 01:34:52,320
because of the amplification of it.
And for me,

1976
01:34:52,321 --> 01:34:52,920
the,
uh,

1977
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:57,920
the distinction that you and I have in 
the way we view the world is that I feel

1978
01:34:59,481 --> 01:35:04,481
that the main agent in extracting this 
element of spirit without,

1979
01:35:04,851 --> 01:35:08,210
which I don't see a solution for the 7 
billion people on this planet,

1980
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:13,390
that the main agent is post secular 
capitalist culture and religion.

1981
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:17,561
Well,
no,

1982
01:35:17,561 --> 01:35:20,290
it's not only religion,
but it's,

1983
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:23,050
it's dogmatism.
It's bad ideas that,

1984
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:28,200
that are immune from criticism and,
and therefore remain effective.

1985
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:30,570
So what we need,
well,

1986
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:31,413
again,
it comes back to conversation and 

1987
01:35:32,201 --> 01:35:34,450
violence.
We need successful conversations.

1988
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:35,613
We need to converge.
We need to find the thing that can be 

1989
01:35:38,111 --> 01:35:43,111
said so as to get the people who are 
wrong to recognize it,

1990
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:44,760
right?
And that's,

1991
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:46,550
that's all of us some of the time,
right?

1992
01:35:46,570 --> 01:35:47,403
Like if it's like,
like how long do you want to be wrong 

1993
01:35:48,401 --> 01:35:49,360
for,
you know,

1994
01:35:49,361 --> 01:35:54,361
how long do you want to be living under 
the sway of a powerful,

1995
01:35:54,851 --> 01:35:55,684
bad idea?
Now there are people who have powerful 

1996
01:35:57,551 --> 01:36:02,290
bad ideas that they class as religious,
who,

1997
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,153
who are determined to live the rest of 
their lives under the sway of those 

1998
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:06,634
ideas,
no matter how much evidence piles up 

1999
01:36:07,931 --> 01:36:10,840
against them and no matter what the 
consequences.

2000
01:36:10,841 --> 01:36:13,600
And so that's why religion for me,
it has a special character,

2001
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:17,650
but political dogmatism is in many 
cases,

2002
01:36:17,651 --> 01:36:20,170
just as problematic.
Economic dogmatism,

2003
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:21,753
economic dogmatism in certain cases 
could be the greatest engine of harm we 

2004
01:36:26,861 --> 01:36:27,970
ever see,
right?

2005
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,350
So it's just,
but it's,

2006
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:30,041
it's,
again,

2007
01:36:30,041 --> 01:36:32,200
it matters what is true.
It matters.

2008
01:36:32,290 --> 01:36:36,730
It matters what causes systems to work 
or to reliably fail.

2009
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:37,603
It does sound.
And given that I think in the last few 

2010
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:41,143
minutes of our conversation,
we've got close to something that seems 

2011
01:36:43,161 --> 01:36:43,994
like a fundamental truth that we can 
agree on that there seems to be some 

2012
01:36:46,581 --> 01:36:51,581
essence behind temporal individuality 
that has some kind of seeming university

2013
01:36:52,221 --> 01:36:53,054
allity though.
How could anybody ever possibly really 

2014
01:36:54,531 --> 01:36:59,000
say that it is,
if we can bring our focus as individuals

2015
01:36:59,001 --> 01:36:59,834
and as a society to that notion and 
notion which does exist in all 

2016
01:37:04,071 --> 01:37:04,960
religions,
uh,

2017
01:37:05,010 --> 01:37:05,630
in,
uh,

2018
01:37:05,630 --> 01:37:10,270
I would say in a relegated role.
And as you said earlier in a role that,

2019
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:11,350
you know,
when Mr [inaudible]

2020
01:37:12,930 --> 01:37:15,740
what's the reason to say that it exists 
in all religions?

2021
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:16,843
Because what if it doesn't like what,
what then or what if it doesn't equally 

2022
01:37:19,821 --> 01:37:20,654
or what if much of the,
of the religion repudiates this core 

2023
01:37:22,581 --> 01:37:23,414
truth?

2024
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:24,373
Well,
I would say that you and I are having 

2025
01:37:26,391 --> 01:37:31,130
the same conversation and agree about 
something fundamental.

2026
01:37:31,131 --> 01:37:31,964
And,
and to elect to disagree for the 

2027
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:37,940
purposes of hypotheses would be a silly 
thing to do because within Christianity,

2028
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:38,774
as you've already said,
there's a mystical tradition within 

2029
01:37:39,741 --> 01:37:41,660
Islam.
There is within Buddhism,

2030
01:37:41,661 --> 01:37:45,490
it's sort of more practically delineates
in gin is I don't know what religion,

2031
01:37:45,491 --> 01:37:46,400
religions,
I don't enough about it.

2032
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:47,383
But what I'm saying is,
is it like that what excites me is when 

2033
01:37:50,451 --> 01:37:55,451
I see perennial mythic template 
recurring through folk law,

2034
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:56,423
faith Montefiore's in pantheism that all
seem to infer the truth that you are 

2035
01:38:00,991 --> 01:38:01,824
personally describing that you have 
psychedelically described that you have 

2036
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,510
neurologically describes me,

2037
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:07,803
don't.
But it's very important to realize that 

2038
01:38:09,521 --> 01:38:14,521
they don't all do it equally and to pay 
lip service to the idea that they're all

2039
01:38:15,611 --> 01:38:18,970
teaching the same thing equally well is 
creating,

2040
01:38:18,971 --> 01:38:20,500
I would argue an immense amount of harm,

2041
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:23,960
but it's some trinity a lot,
but there are some dogmas and doctrines,

2042
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:28,460
but say it doesn't exist and that is 
relevant and that it's not there at all.

2043
01:38:28,461 --> 01:38:32,510
So I don't think like say take our two 
countries.

2044
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:37,600
I don't think the dominant ideology 
ideologies are drawn from religion.

2045
01:38:37,601 --> 01:38:39,930
They're drawn from sort of a sort of,
uh,

2046
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:41,573
posting lightened meant rational 
materialistic ideas and from economic 

2047
01:38:45,261 --> 01:38:46,094
ideas and colonial ideas and post a 
Westphalian tree ideas of state and 

2048
01:38:53,091 --> 01:38:54,530
nation and power.
You know,

2049
01:38:54,531 --> 01:38:58,790
people aren't going to like the big 
problems aren't derived from a sort of a

2050
01:38:58,791 --> 01:39:00,500
religious source.
And if they are,

2051
01:39:00,501 --> 01:39:01,334
they are the very component that share 
those qualities with nonreligious power 

2052
01:39:05,631 --> 01:39:06,464
structures.
The important thing and the thing that 

2053
01:39:08,091 --> 01:39:08,924
is not present almost by definition in a
secular culture is this idea of essence 

2054
01:39:15,170 --> 01:39:19,340
and truth other than through mechanistic
exploration through science,

2055
01:39:19,341 --> 01:39:22,280
which whilst as you have already eh,
brilliantly explained,

2056
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:27,340
easy and valuable it cause like,
I know you've done talks that particular

2057
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:32,450
that directly contradict this,
but we can't answer the questions of the

2058
01:39:33,561 --> 01:39:34,394
experience of essence yet.
And perhaps one day we will perhaps one 

2059
01:39:37,581 --> 01:39:38,414
day we will.
But so it seems to me that there's some 

2060
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:40,733
fighting

2061
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:44,750
one example that I think ties together a
lot of what we disagree about here and,

2062
01:39:44,751 --> 01:39:47,590
and it,
it crystallizes the,

2063
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,680
the point I am urging you to take 
seriously,

2064
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:52,900
uh,
and the don't take it serious.

2065
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:55,250
Take it off.

2066
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:56,650
This particular point,
the mentors,

2067
01:39:56,651 --> 01:39:58,710
let me just crystallize this point.
Uh,

2068
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:00,190
and it's,
it's the,

2069
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:03,040
the problem of dogmatism,
why dogmatism is,

2070
01:40:03,041 --> 01:40:03,874
is,
is basically always bad and 

2071
01:40:05,531 --> 01:40:07,060
unforeseeably bad.
You can net,

2072
01:40:07,061 --> 01:40:12,061
you can't in advance know how bad a 
dogma is going to be just by considering

2073
01:40:12,071 --> 01:40:13,660
that the,
the sentence on paper,

2074
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:14,833
uh,
but the dogmatism is just the wrong 

2075
01:40:16,961 --> 01:40:20,710
methodology for,
for getting anywhere worth going because

2076
01:40:20,711 --> 01:40:23,110
it is the antithesis of,
of open conversation.

2077
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:24,423
And so,
and this is the example that I now 

2078
01:40:26,861 --> 01:40:31,050
always used because it's just,
it just is so clear the,

2079
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:35,380
the dogma that all human life is equally
sacred,

2080
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:40,750
all human lives are equally valuable and
that life starts at the first moment,

2081
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:44,080
the moment of conception right now,
this on its face,

2082
01:40:44,081 --> 01:40:46,240
if you just told me if 20 years ago you 
said,

2083
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:48,250
what if someone who believes this,
what does he,

2084
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:51,910
what sort of needless human misery is he
going to manufacturer?

2085
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:53,140
I would say,
well,

2086
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:53,973
is just a totally,
this is the most benign thing you could 

2087
01:40:55,451 --> 01:40:56,600
possibly believe.
Who,

2088
01:40:56,610 --> 01:40:59,680
who's going to get killed in the service
of this dogma,

2089
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:00,603
right?
Who's going to have be be tortured for 

2090
01:41:02,321 --> 01:41:03,154
decades in the service of this dogma.
But when you look at what people have 

2091
01:41:06,821 --> 01:41:09,400
traditionally done with this specific 
idea,

2092
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:10,780
and this is a Judeo Christian,

2093
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:14,460
the American constitution,
nationalistic,

2094
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:15,480
no,
but,

2095
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:16,870
but,
but especially this,

2096
01:41:16,871 --> 01:41:18,850
this the link to the moment of 
conception.

2097
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:19,681
You,
you,

2098
01:41:19,681 --> 01:41:20,514
you'll look at the millions of Americans
who opposed embryonic stem cell 

2099
01:41:23,981 --> 01:41:24,850
research,
right?

2100
01:41:24,851 --> 01:41:27,320
With all the promise that held right 
here,

2101
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:31,030
we have petri dishes filled with,
it's imagined,

2102
01:41:31,031 --> 01:41:32,640
you know,
hundreds of human souls that,

2103
01:41:32,730 --> 01:41:37,730
that are microscopic and to kill those 
souls would be tantamount to murder.

2104
01:41:38,981 --> 01:41:39,814
To experiment on those souls would be 
tantamount to murder and therefore they 

2105
01:41:43,601 --> 01:41:46,240
didn't want to have a conversation about
all of the,

2106
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:47,223
the children and adults with,
with life deranging injuries and 

2107
01:41:50,711 --> 01:41:52,960
diseases who might've been helped had 
that,

2108
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:54,063
had progress been made in that area.
Now that is a psychotic moral attitude 

2109
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:03,940
made possible by the most benign seeming
dogma,

2110
01:42:04,150 --> 01:42:04,983
right?
I mean literally we're talking about 

2111
01:42:05,531 --> 01:42:06,364
people who,
if you could

2112
01:42:06,510 --> 01:42:09,600
just one aspect of it and they said an 
understandable squeamishness about human

2113
01:42:09,601 --> 01:42:13,200
life and we've all seen that the little 
baby pro life type images and stuff.

2114
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:16,560
But also Sam,
there's an ongoing dialectic between the

2115
01:42:16,561 --> 01:42:17,394
scientific community and religious 
community who's got the right to be the 

2116
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:21,563
dominant,
the parental figure in ownership of the 

2117
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:27,090
public sphere and the public's Seoul in 
inverted commerce.

2118
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:28,230
So like,
you know,

2119
01:42:28,231 --> 01:42:29,064
there's a lot of kick back at Vista 
kickback from Christian groups over the 

2120
01:42:33,071 --> 01:42:33,701
sort of,
you know,

2121
01:42:33,701 --> 01:42:37,280
like evidently beneficial scientific 
endeavors,

2122
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:39,990
barely held belief is I,
I believe so,

2123
01:42:40,230 --> 01:42:41,063
but interest the Zygote at the moment of
conception and then therefore I'm 

2124
01:42:43,361 --> 01:42:43,650
worried.

2125
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:47,220
And is it sort of an interesting sort of
notion and I,

2126
01:42:47,221 --> 01:42:48,054
you know,
I think you and I would be on the same 

2127
01:42:48,721 --> 01:42:50,940
side of that particular argument 
clearly,

2128
01:42:50,941 --> 01:42:51,774
but like,
but what I would say is that we need to 

2129
01:42:53,851 --> 01:42:58,590
again revert to focusing on what is 
truly divine or sublime.

2130
01:42:58,620 --> 01:43:00,690
These moments of interconnectivity and 
oneness.

2131
01:43:00,691 --> 01:43:05,691
And then we wouldn't need trash 
talismans to be placeholders for meaning

2132
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:07,013
in a culture that has lost its meaning.
I would say in significant part because 

2133
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:15,360
the role of the spiritual has been 
relegated to meaninglessness in favor of

2134
01:43:15,361 --> 01:43:18,270
a materialistic mechanistic,
culturally that leads ultimately to sort

2135
01:43:18,271 --> 01:43:21,450
of widespread consumerism and uh,
and uh,

2136
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:24,360
so,
and consciousness and consciousness that

2137
01:43:24,361 --> 01:43:25,194
we are continually in that world of it.
I reiterative for constant tangled 

2138
01:43:31,201 --> 01:43:32,034
thought that because people have no 
experience of the sublime of the divine 

2139
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:36,070
or,

2140
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:36,680
but again,
I,

2141
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:38,690
I wouldn't,
um,

2142
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:42,610
miss you have your own fetishistic 
objects,

2143
01:43:42,611 --> 01:43:44,800
like,
like this notion of consumerism,

2144
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:45,761
right?
So a consumer,

2145
01:43:45,761 --> 01:43:46,594
like you and I are having this 
conversation in a podcast studio at 

2146
01:43:50,441 --> 01:43:51,610
headspace,
right?

2147
01:43:51,890 --> 01:43:54,770
Headspace.
Is it a meditation APP that on,

2148
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:55,604
on,
on the one hand is the quintessence of 

2149
01:43:59,390 --> 01:44:00,290
consumerism.
I mean,

2150
01:44:00,291 --> 01:44:03,740
this is something that only happens in a
smartphone right there.

2151
01:44:03,741 --> 01:44:04,574
The various phone that I was talking 
about this causing people to jump off 

2152
01:44:06,411 --> 01:44:07,490
rooftops,
right?

2153
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:09,140
So,
and yet,

2154
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:13,280
I think headspace is absolutely good 
thing to have out there.

2155
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:13,950
And it's,
and,

2156
01:44:13,950 --> 01:44:15,450
and it is,
it's,

2157
01:44:15,451 --> 01:44:19,880
it's bringing a incredibly useful 
practice to millions of people.

2158
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:21,063
Um,
and podcasts bring incredibly useful 

2159
01:44:23,331 --> 01:44:24,164
conversations to millions of people.
All of this is enabled by mere 

2160
01:44:27,981 --> 01:44:30,770
materialism and mirror consumerism.
And it's,

2161
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:32,053
there's a,
has to be an ethical and spiritually 

2162
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:35,323
correct way to do all this.
It's not a matter of getting rid of the 

2163
01:44:37,911 --> 01:44:39,540
microphones and getting rid of the 
smartphones.

2164
01:44:39,670 --> 01:44:40,400
Yeah,

2165
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:40,730
no,
no,

2166
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:43,970
I'm not suggesting that.
I'm just the same way as you would pause

2167
01:44:43,971 --> 01:44:44,804
it there.
Is there an extremist and dangerous 

2168
01:44:46,491 --> 01:44:50,350
version of Islam,
which I would say has the,

2169
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:53,000
I don't think he's an essentially 
malevolent idea.

2170
01:44:53,001 --> 01:44:55,460
I would disagree with that strongly.
Uh,

2171
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:56,520
I would say that,
uh,

2172
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:59,810
people having objects isn't necessarily 
wrong,

2173
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:00,673
but to fetishize objects and to believe 
that it's some kind of fulfillment and 

2174
01:45:04,491 --> 01:45:05,324
spiritual solution can be achieved 
through the acquisition of objects is 

2175
01:45:09,591 --> 01:45:10,424
dangerous and all the more dangerous 
because it's not so explicitly 

2176
01:45:13,491 --> 01:45:15,410
understood.
But that's what's happening.

2177
01:45:15,590 --> 01:45:16,380
That the,
the,

2178
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:17,040
the,
the,

2179
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:17,873
the,
the extremist ideology that we already 

2180
01:45:19,161 --> 01:45:23,120
live with in is so all encompassing that
we cannot see it's horizons that we have

2181
01:45:23,121 --> 01:45:25,490
lost the tools to understand it and 
describe it.

2182
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:29,570
I'm not talking about sort of a post 
Stalinist leftist position.

2183
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:33,740
I'm talking about the reinvention and 
the reembracing of the human soul.

2184
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:34,573
Can we find that you've talked a Sam 
endlessly about we need to have a 

2185
01:45:38,151 --> 01:45:38,781
conversation.
Well,

2186
01:45:38,781 --> 01:45:41,240
you and I are having a conversation.
I believe in God.

2187
01:45:41,330 --> 01:45:42,163
You don't believe in God.
And it turns out that the differences 

2188
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:48,140
aren't actually when it boils down to it
that meaningful.

2189
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:51,900
Because when it comes to love of our 
daughters freedom,

2190
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:55,550
compassion,
we ultimately believe the same things.

2191
01:45:55,551 --> 01:45:58,340
I think that that unless you and I can 
find a way of saying,

2192
01:45:58,341 --> 01:45:59,840
okay,
I respect that.

2193
01:45:59,841 --> 01:46:00,201
I,
you know,

2194
01:46:00,201 --> 01:46:03,710
like a lot of my,
the people whose guidance I seek,

2195
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:05,120
uh,
most,

2196
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:07,640
uh,
earnestly are atheists,

2197
01:46:07,641 --> 01:46:08,990
but that,
that doesn't change.

2198
01:46:08,991 --> 01:46:11,510
The fact that I believe that there is,
there is,

2199
01:46:11,570 --> 01:46:12,403
there are levels of consciousness that 
are beyond material phenomena that will 

2200
01:46:15,591 --> 01:46:16,424
net will never understand free 
magnifications of the human senses or 

2201
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:21,010
further analysis of,
uh,

2202
01:46:21,011 --> 01:46:26,011
of the material objects because there 
are limitations to the human mind,

2203
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,211
you know,
and,

2204
01:46:28,211 --> 01:46:31,100
and ultimately [inaudible].
Importantly,

2205
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:33,950
Sam,
I also think that all of this stuff,

2206
01:46:33,951 --> 01:46:34,950
all of this,
uh,

2207
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:35,813
a theorial wittering has no meaning 
unless it translates into love and 

2208
01:46:40,371 --> 01:46:42,980
compassion.
Unless there is some meaning in the idea

2209
01:46:42,981 --> 01:46:43,814
that there is some connection between a 
tree in a hand if you achieve the 

2210
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:47,570
correct mental state.

2211
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:48,271
Yeah,
I mean,

2212
01:46:48,271 --> 01:46:51,540
again,
there are wrinkles here that I just want

2213
01:46:51,541 --> 01:46:52,374
to flag.
One is that extreme and mental pleasure 

2214
01:46:56,490 --> 01:46:59,040
is divorced from ethics.
So for instance,

2215
01:46:59,041 --> 01:46:59,874
to go back to this,
this perverse case that we started with 

2216
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,380
suicide bombing,
I,

2217
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:05,453
I have good reason to believe that the 
mental state of a suicide bomber before 

2218
01:47:09,721 --> 01:47:11,820
he thinks euphoric.
Yes,

2219
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:12,360
yes.
I,

2220
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:13,193
we're not talking about suicidal people 
who are just trying to end the 

2221
01:47:15,991 --> 01:47:16,824
depression as fast as possible.
We're talking about people who are on 

2222
01:47:20,011 --> 01:47:20,970
the cusp of the,

2223
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:25,660
the deepest spiritual reward that 
summer's Tommy,

2224
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:27,030
we stopped on miss.
Take a person,

2225
01:47:27,031 --> 01:47:31,020
like a policeman that's willing to risk 
his own life to rescue,

2226
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:33,330
rescue a child in Japanese.
Similarly,

2227
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:36,750
their regard for their own life is being
abandoned in that moment.

2228
01:47:36,751 --> 01:47:40,700
And that too could be described as a 
kind of euphoria because it like,

2229
01:47:40,701 --> 01:47:43,110
it happens to fit in with our worldview.
We're cool with it.

2230
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:43,591
Yeah.
Well,

2231
01:47:43,591 --> 01:47:44,121
yeah.
And,

2232
01:47:44,121 --> 01:47:44,471
and,
and,

2233
01:47:44,471 --> 01:47:45,304
but so that's what I'm saying,
the real consequences for human beings 

2234
01:47:48,551 --> 01:47:52,480
matter and it's possible to,
I mean,

2235
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:57,550
euphoria is something and in a sense of 
meaning is something that can be totally

2236
01:47:57,551 --> 01:47:58,384
misaligned with what I think we would 
agree is an actual ethical relationship 

2237
01:48:02,021 --> 01:48:05,620
and an actual spiritual insight.
And so that's it.

2238
01:48:05,621 --> 01:48:08,500
So,
so euphoria is not a perfect guide.

2239
01:48:08,710 --> 01:48:12,670
It can be very misleading guide for 
wisdom and compassion.

2240
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:13,780
That's,
that's the point.

2241
01:48:13,781 --> 01:48:13,970
Okay.

2242
01:48:13,970 --> 01:48:16,380
It's true of Nixon bloody bad decisions 
as a result.

2243
01:48:17,170 --> 01:48:18,140
Yeah.
And so,

2244
01:48:18,141 --> 01:48:18,974
and,
and the absence of euphoria can also be 

2245
01:48:20,811 --> 01:48:22,020
misleading because you can,
they're,

2246
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:22,973
they're genuinely like what I just said 
about this kind of non dual experience 

2247
01:48:27,021 --> 01:48:28,850
in meditation.
You can,

2248
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,360
you can have it in a very subtle way 
that doesn't have,

2249
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:34,423
doesn't summon him at least,
certainly doesn't immediately summon 

2250
01:48:36,321 --> 01:48:38,840
some radical change in your,
your,

2251
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:40,850
the feeling tone of your experience.
It can be,

2252
01:48:41,090 --> 01:48:43,680
it can be as simple as just looking at a
water bottles,

2253
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:44,491
you know,
and,

2254
01:48:44,491 --> 01:48:45,241
and it's just,
you know,

2255
01:48:45,241 --> 01:48:47,390
it's just the lights are on and there's 
no center.

2256
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:48,673
Now you can feel that for just a moment 
and not recognize it's revolutionary 

2257
01:48:53,361 --> 01:48:56,570
significance because it doesn't come 
with the upwelling of,

2258
01:48:56,930 --> 01:49:00,710
of rapture or bliss that people 
associate with good meditation or,

2259
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:05,690
or a psychedelic experience or,
or ordinary religiosity like feelings of

2260
01:49:05,691 --> 01:49:09,350
love while chanting or singing in church
or,

2261
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:10,520
or whatever.

2262
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:12,200
Or a football match where they're like,
yeah,

2263
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:15,740
there are various contexts in which 
these states can be achieved.

2264
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:16,873
And I suppose what I believe is that we 
should be looking to create the state's 

2265
01:49:20,121 --> 01:49:20,954
prioritize the states and give more 
people access to them through whatever 

2266
01:49:25,701 --> 01:49:26,540
means,
you know,

2267
01:49:26,570 --> 01:49:27,403
certainly I don't agree with the 
imposition of an ideology of Dogma on 

2268
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:32,840
anybody else,
you know?

2269
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:36,800
And I can tell and I think the key 
obstacles to that are a huge centralized

2270
01:49:36,801 --> 01:49:39,530
power bases.
And then without the removal of that,

2271
01:49:39,531 --> 01:49:41,510
I don't see how there could be a 
solution.

2272
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:43,930
Yeah,
well we,

2273
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:44,973
you know,
I don't,

2274
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:46,890
I don't know how much we disagree about 
all that.

2275
01:49:46,891 --> 01:49:47,724
I mean,
haven't,

2276
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:50,830
again,
it's all a matter of alternatives.

2277
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:51,641
It's like it's,
you know,

2278
01:49:51,641 --> 01:49:52,474
democracy seems impressively broken to 
me and capitalism seems impressively 

2279
01:49:56,561 --> 01:49:59,890
broken to me,
except the alternatives seem worse.

2280
01:49:59,891 --> 01:50:00,700
I mean,
this is,

2281
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:05,360
this is a Winston Churchill,
so,

2282
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:06,580
but,
but no,

2283
01:50:06,581 --> 01:50:09,610
but I think we just need to find our 
way,

2284
01:50:09,611 --> 01:50:12,160
but just recognize what we're doing.
We are,

2285
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:13,143
we're trying to grab whatever lever or 
dial we can get within reach to change 

2286
01:50:17,591 --> 01:50:22,520
the human experience in predictably 
benign and ultimately positive way.

2287
01:50:22,530 --> 01:50:23,363
Do you feel much fear in life?
Do you feel afraid much like in your 

2288
01:50:26,891 --> 01:50:28,360
tummy?
I mean in your brain?

2289
01:50:30,740 --> 01:50:34,880
It's more in my brain than it.
Well,

2290
01:50:34,881 --> 01:50:35,541
I mean,
no it's not.

2291
01:50:35,541 --> 01:50:37,580
It's not that I can't feel fear I,
but,

2292
01:50:37,610 --> 01:50:42,380
but the things that I worry about 
publicly as a matter of,

2293
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,050
you know,
being someone who talks and writes about

2294
01:50:45,051 --> 01:50:45,884
these things is not indicative of my 
feeling adrenalized and fearful all the 

2295
01:50:52,461 --> 01:50:52,881
time.
I mean,

2296
01:50:52,881 --> 01:50:54,050
it's not the,
that you can,

2297
01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:55,213
you can worry about new.
I mean that actually the thing that 

2298
01:50:57,651 --> 01:50:58,484
worries me most again at the brain level
is that the greatest risks to human 

2299
01:51:04,011 --> 01:51:08,360
wellbeing are hard to take seriously.
It's like,

2300
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:10,430
I mean,
they're the people who think,

2301
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:13,000
who professionally think about nuclear 
war and,

2302
01:51:13,001 --> 01:51:13,834
and new and the consequences of 
proliferation and people like William 

2303
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:17,061
Perry,
you know,

2304
01:51:17,061 --> 01:51:20,310
that the,
I guess he's close to 90 now.

2305
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:21,173
He was 85.

2306
01:51:22,780 --> 01:51:23,613
Uh,

2307
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:25,533
these people think that we are at the 
most dangerous place we've been in the 

2308
01:51:30,311 --> 01:51:32,630
last 75 years with respect to the 
likelihood of,

2309
01:51:32,631 --> 01:51:33,940
of a nuclear exchange.
Right.

2310
01:51:33,941 --> 01:51:37,120
So as I could like think the Cold War is
not only not over,

2311
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:40,750
it is like from from Paris point of 
view,

2312
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:44,470
we are in another Cuban missile crisis 
right now.

2313
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:47,420
And nobody's worried about Russia or 
Korea.

2314
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:48,293
Well,
the,

2315
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:49,300
yeah,
all of it.

2316
01:51:49,301 --> 01:51:50,250
Yeah.
But I mean I think,

2317
01:51:50,290 --> 01:51:53,020
I think it's the possibility of a 
mistake.

2318
01:51:53,021 --> 01:51:54,040
I mean,
the book I would,

2319
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:54,903
I would recommend your listeners read,
which should make them suitably afraid 

2320
01:51:58,931 --> 01:52:01,960
is Eric Schlosser's book command and 
control,

2321
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:06,220
which is just a story of how many 
mishaps and how many,

2322
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:07,353
how,
how haphazard our stewardship of these 

2323
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,670
nuclear weapons has been.
It's just,

2324
01:52:12,671 --> 01:52:13,504
it's been by dent of sheer dumb luck 
that we haven't nuked ourselves or 

2325
01:52:16,391 --> 01:52:18,250
provoked a,
an exchange between,

2326
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:22,240
between Russia and the United States 
based on just bad information,

2327
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:23,283
you know?

2328
01:52:23,290 --> 01:52:24,760
Um,
so,

2329
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:25,623
but so what is worrisome here is that 
it's hard to spend more than five 

2330
01:52:29,801 --> 01:52:31,780
minutes worrying about that on any given
day.

2331
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:32,111
You know,
like,

2332
01:52:32,111 --> 01:52:32,831
well,
I can worry,

2333
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:36,970
I can worry a lot about totally trivial 
things in my own life,

2334
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:37,440
right?
Like,

2335
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,100
if,
if my website goes down,

2336
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:40,141
you know,
the field,

2337
01:52:40,141 --> 01:52:40,974
my feeling of,
of kind of moral emergency is at 11 

2338
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:46,880
right?
I like what the fuck is happening.

2339
01:52:46,881 --> 01:52:48,220
My website is down.
Like I,

2340
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:49,190
I,
you know,

2341
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:50,550
I want to call the,
the,

2342
01:52:50,551 --> 01:52:51,110
the,
the,

2343
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:53,900
my website developers and it's an 
emergency.

2344
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:58,010
It's like,
and yet when talking about when,

2345
01:52:58,011 --> 01:52:59,670
when I hear that the,
the people who,

2346
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,513
who make it,
their business to think about the 

2347
01:53:01,431 --> 01:53:02,264
prospect,
that whole cities may be annihilated by 

2348
01:53:04,941 --> 01:53:05,774
the biggest bombs in our lifetime.
When I hear that they are more worried 

2349
01:53:09,681 --> 01:53:11,960
than they have ever been,
I can,

2350
01:53:11,961 --> 01:53:14,720
you know,
five minutes after we talk about this,

2351
01:53:14,721 --> 01:53:16,250
I'm not going to be thinking about it.
Right.

2352
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:17,113
And that worries me is hard to,
it's hard to have an appropriate 

2353
01:53:19,401 --> 01:53:22,910
emotional response to what we think the 
data show.

2354
01:53:22,911 --> 01:53:25,280
And so it is with the suffering of other
people,

2355
01:53:25,281 --> 01:53:26,960
you know,
you feel it about the homeless person.

2356
01:53:26,961 --> 01:53:29,780
You can see on this sidewalk that you 
happened to be walking on.

2357
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:30,913
But to hear that 90,000
people in Los Angeles County are 

2358
01:53:33,621 --> 01:53:35,150
homeless,
it's,

2359
01:53:35,210 --> 01:53:36,110
it's,
it's,

2360
01:53:36,770 --> 01:53:40,100
it's inconceivable.
And it's hard to summon an inappropriate

2361
01:53:40,101 --> 01:53:41,030
emotional response.

2362
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:44,790
Yes.
That is perhaps some,

2363
01:53:44,970 --> 01:53:49,440
we've been bull out of alignment with 
what we're capable of receiving,

2364
01:53:49,470 --> 01:53:54,470
what we're can capable of transmitting.
It's talking of sort of anthropology,

2365
01:53:55,261 --> 01:53:58,830
I suppose the bats,
human beings have been so extracted from

2366
01:53:58,831 --> 01:54:00,270
these conditions that are,
you know,

2367
01:54:00,271 --> 01:54:03,210
where you said we wouldn't even 
recognize what disease was.

2368
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:04,173
We've,
we've,

2369
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:06,660
we have become as gods,
we have a cheer,

2370
01:54:06,661 --> 01:54:07,494
some mounted,
so many obstacles that perhaps we have 

2371
01:54:09,811 --> 01:54:10,644
no,
we are no longer living within a pallet 

2372
01:54:12,481 --> 01:54:15,780
that is appropriate for this particular 
mammal.

2373
01:54:16,810 --> 01:54:21,810
But we also just have bugs in our 
hardware and software that we are bad at

2374
01:54:22,181 --> 01:54:24,850
correcting for [inaudible] and that,
and that's why,

2375
01:54:25,510 --> 01:54:28,270
that's why again,
systemic corrections,

2376
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:29,373
you like good laws and good tax codes 
and good governments and good 

2377
01:54:32,141 --> 01:54:36,130
institutions I think will do much 
heavier lifting for us.

2378
01:54:36,131 --> 01:54:36,964
Then all of us getting our heads 
straight and keeping them straight day 

2379
01:54:40,391 --> 01:54:41,224
after day.
So I made the example that I'll give 

2380
01:54:42,941 --> 01:54:45,700
here is based on the work of Paul 
Slovic,

2381
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:47,450
um,
who found it.

2382
01:54:47,451 --> 01:54:48,284
It's just,
it's a propensity for moral error that 

2383
01:54:49,691 --> 01:54:51,550
is totally shocking.
So if you tell people,

2384
01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:53,103
uh,
you give them like the classics are to 

2385
01:54:54,461 --> 01:54:56,210
Unicef Pitch,
like here's you know,

2386
01:54:56,230 --> 01:54:58,840
one little girl in Sudan,
you know,

2387
01:54:58,841 --> 01:55:02,410
her name is,
is Jenny.

2388
01:55:02,790 --> 01:55:03,700
Uh,
she,

2389
01:55:03,701 --> 01:55:05,020
you know,
her parents were killed.

2390
01:55:05,230 --> 01:55:08,620
She needs your help.
$5 a day will keep her in school and all

2391
01:55:08,621 --> 01:55:09,454
the rest,
right?

2392
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:13,510
You tell that story with one 
identifiable child peep,

2393
01:55:13,511 --> 01:55:16,000
you get the maximum response of 
compassion and,

2394
01:55:16,001 --> 01:55:20,560
and F and actual altruism from people.
You ask them how much they'll give every

2395
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:21,393
month and you get their maximum number.
If you show that same girl to a 

2396
01:55:24,851 --> 01:55:27,820
different group of people along with her
brother and you say,

2397
01:55:27,821 --> 01:55:32,020
here's Jenny and here's Jacob.
They've suffered this horrible atrocity.

2398
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:34,060
$5 a day,
we'll go $5 a month,

2399
01:55:34,061 --> 01:55:35,410
we'll,
we'll keep them in school,

2400
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:37,610
et Cetera.
The,

2401
01:55:37,670 --> 01:55:39,160
the,
the altruism and the,

2402
01:55:39,161 --> 01:55:39,994
and the self assessment of compassion 
reliably goes down just more to the 

2403
01:55:44,131 --> 01:55:45,240
scope of the problem,
right?

2404
01:55:45,241 --> 01:55:47,880
And it's the same girl in the same boy,
you add 10,

2405
01:55:47,910 --> 01:55:50,790
it goes down further.
It goes through the floor and if you add

2406
01:55:50,791 --> 01:55:53,010
background,
background statistics,

2407
01:55:53,011 --> 01:55:56,790
if you say this little girl Jenny,
she's got this terrible problem,

2408
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:57,743
you can help and there's a hundred 
thousand girls just like her in Sudan 

2409
01:56:00,601 --> 01:56:01,980
alone,
people just

2410
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:03,410
passion,
just wash it.

2411
01:56:03,411 --> 01:56:07,370
That kind of apathy is a kind of despair
and you kind of hope there's just no,

2412
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:07,780
there's no

2413
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:09,220
point in doing anything.

2414
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:11,130
And so that's what we have to correct 
for that.

2415
01:56:11,690 --> 01:56:14,960
Teleology of civilization then seemed 
somewhat broken.

2416
01:56:14,990 --> 01:56:19,300
The idea that sort of like the,
the grow bigger and bigger states and as

2417
01:56:19,301 --> 01:56:20,134
sort of a,
a sort of a globally mandated 

2418
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:23,053
government,
these would seem to be poor ideas like 

2419
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:25,873
what may work for human beings for the 7
billion is de centralization and to 

2420
01:56:30,741 --> 01:56:32,660
achieve that,
to achieve real change,

2421
01:56:32,870 --> 01:56:36,230
where do you suppose the fulcrum will 
need to be applied?

2422
01:56:36,350 --> 01:56:38,960
Who are the people for whom?
The 90,000

2423
01:56:38,961 --> 01:56:41,200
homeless and Little Jenny and the 
hundred thousand others.

2424
01:56:41,290 --> 01:56:42,123
Oh,
not really a problem because their 

2425
01:56:43,371 --> 01:56:47,180
system is operating precisely as it was 
intended to operate.

2426
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:48,960
Well,
it's all of us here again,

2427
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:51,900
there are not that many bad people.
It's,

2428
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:53,003
we have,
we have a default level of selfishness 

2429
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:00,173
in virtually everyone all the time.
And that we have to figure out how to 

2430
01:57:04,801 --> 01:57:09,720
game that and channel that successfully 
toward more benign ends.

2431
01:57:09,950 --> 01:57:10,180
I mean,
you,

2432
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:13,740
you what you want the perfect system,
and this is what capitalism promises but

2433
01:57:13,741 --> 01:57:14,574
doesn't deliver,
is everyone selfishly seeking happiness 

2434
01:57:20,281 --> 01:57:21,114
for,
for themselves and prioritizing the 

2435
01:57:22,951 --> 01:57:24,930
happiness of their families,
their loved ones,

2436
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:26,063
and then maybe going out a few and maybe
extending that circle more and more as 

2437
01:57:30,901 --> 01:57:33,300
they learn more and more about the other
problems in the world.

2438
01:57:33,330 --> 01:57:34,170
Yes.
But they'll never,

2439
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:37,950
they'll never extend that circle 
perfectly or they'll,

2440
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:38,843
or most people certainly won't.
And what you want is a system that 

2441
01:57:42,961 --> 01:57:43,794
captures all of that energy in a way 
that allows all boats or most boats to 

2442
01:57:49,081 --> 01:57:51,630
rise with the same tide most of the 
time.

2443
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:53,640
And,
uh,

2444
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:54,533
is there,
is there a perfect solution to all of 

2445
01:57:56,371 --> 01:57:59,160
these zero sum and,
and,

2446
01:57:59,161 --> 01:58:02,520
and positive some arrangements.
Um,

2447
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:03,623
I don't know,
but there's certainly better and worse 

2448
01:58:05,311 --> 01:58:06,630
ones.
And we know,

2449
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:07,493
we know that.
We know there's some bad ones on offer 

2450
01:58:09,271 --> 01:58:12,820
that we don't want to experiment with 
again and we want to refine our,

2451
01:58:12,821 --> 01:58:13,654
our current set of solutions so that 
life gets better and better for 

2452
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:18,600
[inaudible].
The truth is,

2453
01:58:18,820 --> 01:58:19,653
it's,
this can sound like a very despairing 

2454
01:58:20,551 --> 01:58:21,384
conversation,
but life has gotten better and better 

2455
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:29,600
for virtually everyone in our lifetime.
I mean if you look at the last century,

2456
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:32,313
I mean it's something like 10% of people
now live in extreme poverty and 90% of 

2457
01:58:37,111 --> 01:58:38,850
people don't.
We've got 7 billion people,

2458
01:58:38,851 --> 01:58:42,160
90% of them are not in what we're 
calling extreme poverty.

2459
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:46,480
The something like 150 years ago that 
was flipped,

2460
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:48,580
it was 90 10 the other way.
It was only,

2461
01:58:48,581 --> 01:58:51,620
it was 90% in extreme poverty.
Um,

2462
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:52,773
I suppose again,
they send the metric by which we judge 

2463
01:58:54,071 --> 01:58:58,600
poverty and the metric by which we judge
human experience is something that could

2464
01:58:58,601 --> 01:59:01,540
be long debated.
And for me,

2465
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:06,541
I suppose what I'm interested in and I 
the here I think we can cut his truth,

2466
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:09,213
truthful experience io at listen to a 
podcast you did once and like a with 

2467
01:59:12,251 --> 01:59:13,084
someone else.
I respect very much Jordan piece and it 

2468
01:59:14,591 --> 01:59:15,424
got caught up along while on some sort 
of semantic tangle and like so but what 

2469
01:59:19,571 --> 01:59:21,520
I feel is that,
you know,

2470
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:27,340
I am interested in my own sweet,
selfish,

2471
01:59:27,341 --> 01:59:32,341
egotistical way in conveying and 
transmit in love and change.

2472
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:34,263
And I think that the point where I feel 
pressure needs to be applied if that's 

2473
01:59:39,171 --> 01:59:43,310
even the right attitude,
you need it be combative.

2474
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:44,960
Uh,
for me there's sort of the focus,

2475
01:59:45,110 --> 01:59:45,943
I think individual personal revolution 
and personal salvation and I think he's 

2476
01:59:49,031 --> 01:59:49,864
a,
an important component and the 

2477
01:59:51,081 --> 01:59:51,914
introduction of ideas that go beyond 
rationalism and materialism may be a 

2478
01:59:55,701 --> 02:00:00,200
necessary spur for significant change.
I feel like rationalism,

2479
02:00:00,201 --> 02:00:01,730
materialism,
lead people to believe,

2480
02:00:01,731 --> 02:00:04,550
well we are just individuals.
We're here for a short amount of time,

2481
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:05,593
pleasure sensation.
It seems to me that just looking around 

2482
02:00:08,270 --> 02:00:11,930
that seems to be what is happening.
It seems to disengage people.

2483
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:15,140
And then some of the examples you've 
given about your human compassion,

2484
02:00:15,310 --> 02:00:15,731
it seemed,
it,

2485
02:00:15,731 --> 02:00:16,564
it's very,
it seems very hard for people to access 

2486
02:00:19,101 --> 02:00:19,934
love to access community and within the 
operating system that currently have 

2487
02:00:23,531 --> 02:00:24,364
bites.

2488
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:25,313
I would agree.
Yeah.

2489
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:26,873
We need more again,
what you're talking about our systems 

2490
02:00:30,570 --> 02:00:33,600
and institutions that,
you know,

2491
02:00:34,370 --> 02:00:37,020
just how good could a school be,
right?

2492
02:00:37,021 --> 02:00:39,930
How good could entertainment be?
How good could,

2493
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:42,330
uh,
the Internet be?

2494
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:43,193
How good could smell,
how good could social media be in terms 

2495
02:00:45,511 --> 02:00:48,240
of leading us where we want to go,
both,

2496
02:00:48,241 --> 02:00:53,241
both personally and interpersonally.
And I think we are at the beginning of,

2497
02:00:55,380 --> 02:00:56,213
uh,

2498
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:00,880
perfecting those things.
And it's not,

2499
02:01:00,881 --> 02:01:03,340
it's not that we'll reach perfection,
but it,

2500
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:04,263
I mean,
all of these things are obviously so 

2501
02:01:06,481 --> 02:01:11,100
broken as they are now that we just 
don't know how much better life would be

2502
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:15,270
if we got halfway to,
to the optimum.

2503
02:01:15,790 --> 02:01:17,670
Um,
it's just,

2504
02:01:17,671 --> 02:01:18,504
uh,

2505
02:01:19,410 --> 02:01:20,243
uh,

2506
02:01:21,650 --> 02:01:22,483
there's an immense amount of work to do 
and the work will be done on the basis 

2507
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,593
of having insights into truth and having
a fact based discussion about the 

2508
02:01:31,701 --> 02:01:33,980
consequences of,
of,

2509
02:01:34,670 --> 02:01:36,740
uh,
turning any of these knobs.

2510
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:38,353
Sam Harris in the background about it,
there's the gallery to this small 

2511
02:01:41,511 --> 02:01:42,344
facility that headspace the brilliant 
app in spite of the contradictions of 

2512
02:01:45,471 --> 02:01:48,320
having existed in a consumer's 
technological world,

2513
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:53,030
which I would like to give props theme 
was against the wall and that one,

2514
02:01:53,650 --> 02:01:55,630
I mean,
but you know,

2515
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:56,473
we're,
we're going,

2516
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:57,313
there ain't no wall to sort of send me 
quote doc Brown in the transcendent 

2517
02:01:59,931 --> 02:02:00,920
realm,
the wall,

2518
02:02:00,921 --> 02:02:01,970
the me,
the you,

2519
02:02:02,090 --> 02:02:02,923
all one or glorious oneness.
People have been holding up like ice 

2520
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:10,240
skating goes like 45 minutes,
60 minutes for 120 minutes now,

2521
02:02:10,701 --> 02:02:13,310
just that duration of the podcast right 
now for me,

2522
02:02:13,311 --> 02:02:14,144
it's been a great joy and a great 
pleasure and a rigorous intellectual 

2523
02:02:17,541 --> 02:02:19,580
workouts.
And I speak with you and I'm enjoying it

2524
02:02:19,581 --> 02:02:21,650
very much.
Sam Harrison most grateful.

2525
02:02:21,651 --> 02:02:22,484
And I've returned to the idea that 
conversations are what's likely to 

2526
02:02:27,591 --> 02:02:28,424
produce change,
particularly conversations between 

2527
02:02:30,111 --> 02:02:32,900
people that don't automatically agree on
the most significant issue.

2528
02:02:32,900 --> 02:02:35,270
So I'm incredibly grateful to you.
Likewise.

2529
02:02:35,271 --> 02:02:36,020
Well,
thank you.

2530
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:36,441
Thanks,
man.

2531
02:02:36,441 --> 02:02:40,280
