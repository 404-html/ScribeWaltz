1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
Oh,
very interested in mental health.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,580
Why is that mate?
Are You mad?

3
00:00:04,581 --> 00:00:07,780
I say this,
looking back on your feet?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,710
Um,
I,

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,570
I,
I wouldn't have called myself.

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,053
I used to have severe,
severe anxiety and depression about 10 

7
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:20,214
years ago and I'm now the anxiety and 
depression free for 10 years because of 

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,770
I've got a rigid mental health system.
I've got to self care system.

9
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:29,604
Mainly.
I was lucky like I never suffered from 

10
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:33,720
mental illness.
My issue was mental health,

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,480
which to me means that my view of 
myself,

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,383
my view of other people and my view of 
the world was excessively negative and 

13
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:43,721
fearful.
Oh,

14
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:47,010
that's a good definition.
So I just basically tested it.

15
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:47,844
I wrote,
I read reappraised how I felt about 

16
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:50,664
myself.
I've heard about other people and I do 

17
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,960
that on a daily basis and mental health 
regime really,

18
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:57,510
to be honest,
it's no different to exercise.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
Could you first of all,
before we hear that,

20
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:02,880
and I'm sure I'd like to hear what you 
do for your sort of,

21
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:03,714
your regimen for mental health.
Could you describe the depression and 

22
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:08,580
anxiety as you experienced it 10 years 
ago?

23
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:09,414
What was it like,
what did it feel like and how did it 

24
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:12,760
impact your life?
Um,

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,040
what have been about 18 or 19?
He,

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:16,973
the thing is my main thing would have 
been anxiety and the thing is with 

27
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:19,974
anxiety,
anxiety can result in quite a lot of 

28
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:25,590
shame because my anxiety kept me from 
leaving the house,

29
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,143
so I would,
I'd get anxiety attacks in a certain 

30
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:33,540
place like in the pub are in a 
supermarket.

31
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,910
So the natural thing for me to do.
Then the logical thing was,

32
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,950
oh,
soup markets given me anxiety attacks,

33
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:42,450
I can't go there anymore.
But before newest I was kind of stuck in

34
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:43,320
my room all the time.

35
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,050
Afraid to leave the house in case you 
get an anxiety attack that then brings a

36
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,203
ferocious amount.
The shame would it because then I start 

37
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:51,870
judging myself,
going on my friends,

38
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:53,070
okay,
we'll go into the shop.

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,590
What's wrong with me?
That then resulted in depression.

40
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,220
So it's this really shady,
so eager.

41
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,853
And I think the road of my,
like I was just afraid of being an 

42
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,390
adult.
I was terrified of being autonomous,

43
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:04,224
you know,
do,

44
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,103
what would you say you were taking out 
the cause and that was going to be my 

45
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,670
next question.
I don't know why I want you to know that

46
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,250
that was gonna be my next question.
Like as if I'm psychic,

47
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,970
but was there some sort of trauma would 
you say?

48
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:16,570
Or like what do you think precipitated 
it?

49
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:17,404
I mean I understand this thought,
that cyclical idea of feeling ashamed 

50
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:21,690
and not feeling like you can do with 
other people.

51
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,840
I can still get a little bit like that 
now as a matter of fact,

52
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:25,674
but like how does like do.
But I would now relate that to oh this 

53
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:31,080
is because when you were a kid,
this happened and that happened.

54
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,203
Do you have that kind of awareness?
Or like my parents were quite old and 

55
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,150
when I was borrowing a fairly bad 
asthma,

56
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,720
but my fucking enough for job back on 
your fucking.

57
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,103
I know,
yeah.

58
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,470
It says on the plastic,
but I do not put this on your end.

59
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,390
I might add if they were going to put 
something out,

60
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,510
especially not if you've got asthma.
Amazing in a very mythic sense,

61
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,170
my mother first to point out because I 
want some to.

62
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:00,850
No,
no,

63
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,370
no one is pointing to that particular 
one.

64
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,220
I guess.
Thanks.

65
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,783
Bonding around of applause with 
someone's opening up about their 

66
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,420
psychological history.

67
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,220
That's the level of narcissism we're 
dealing with.

68
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:16,150
So like your parents were older and you 
had asthma.

69
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,250
Very bad asthma and my dad would have 
been quite anxious.

70
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,480
He and I can actually trace my father's 
anxiety back to the famine.

71
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,073
He,
he learned how to be anxious off his 

72
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,970
manner and his men.
I learned how to be anxious.

73
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,160
I've heard Matt who was actually 
starving,

74
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,593
so patterns of of anxious behavior and 
depressive personality types will pass 

75
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:41,740
through and sort of amazing,
but it makes sense.

76
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,603
It's true.
There will be a generational trauma is 

77
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:45,814
an idea.
You know quite a lot about 

78
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:46,984
psychoanalysis.
Don't you have a degree in it or 

79
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:48,790
something?
I studied,

80
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,624
I did like three or four years training 
to be a psychotherapist and then it 

81
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:53,080
stopped so I could wear a bag in my 
head.

82
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,530
Brilliant,
good decision.

83
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:57,610
Good decision.
The psychotherapies last is plastic bags

84
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,080
game,
so we may like,

85
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,933
so would you say that idea of 
generational trauma does that you've 

86
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:08,110
just been quite frivolous,
but two ways like there,

87
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,560
there,
there,

88
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,393
there is actual research now being done 
into trauma being been passed on 

89
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:14,680
genetically.

90
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,513
They're looking specifically as how 
people in the Holocaust and how 

91
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:21,010
genetically trauma is passed on.
Now that's a very new field,

92
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,220
which is quite hard to get your head 
around,

93
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:28,900
but the simple one is behaviors get 
passed on.

94
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,000
If you're a young child and you,
you're around.

95
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,373
If your parent is excessively angry or 
if you're a parent naturally looks at 

96
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:36,904
things in a negative fashion.
The child knows nothing other than to 

97
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:41,740
look at the parent as the authority of 
truth.

98
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,080
So we learn these things,
but the beauty of being the common,

99
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,860
an adult psychotherapy and self help is 
that narrative you learn as a child.

100
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,930
Once you to become a fucking adult,
you can go,

101
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,310
Holy Shit,
that's not the way it is.

102
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:56,560
I can rewrite my script,
so yeah,

103
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:58,240
for me,
my dad used to.

104
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,490
He found out that I had asthma.
He,

105
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,320
the doctor would have said,
well,

106
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:04,480
there's a slight chance of death,
but you know,

107
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,540
and then my dad would have ran out of 
the hospital going,

108
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,413
oh,
he's going to die.

109
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,433
So when I was about three or four,
if I was to want to play soccer with my 

110
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,390
friends,
he would just start going,

111
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,440
no,
you'll die.

112
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,550
Do you know what I mean?
And that was off putting.

113
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,250
Yeah,
it was like,

114
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:22,150
he,
he man on mark him,

115
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,200
you're going to die.
So me being being four or five,

116
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,063
it's like the adult is telling me I'm 
going to die if I do normal things that 

117
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:33,160
my normal friends are doing too.
And it was to protect me.

118
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:38,161
But then when I got older and normal 
thing meant going to fucking school,

119
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,950
going out things that were adult 
deepened way unconscious,

120
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:44,830
it manifested itself as a severe fear of
a debt.

121
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,810
That's good analysis.
Good self analysis.

122
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,590
How Japanese narrativize nation.
There we are on this show.

123
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,620
We upload self awareness kind of new 
age.

124
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,860
Um,
but like yeah,

125
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:58,694
that's,
that's pretty interesting that they 

126
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,850
finished in Nevada or isn't.
Do you not think that?

127
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:04,130
Could be,
in a sense the,

128
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:04,964
uh,
central definition of adulthood and 

129
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:09,620
ability to control your own narrative to
say,

130
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:13,070
I am no longer my trauma,
I am no longer my past.

131
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,100
I can recreate myself.
Absolutely.

132
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,930
That is the key to being an adult I 
think is like,

133
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,580
it's,
it's first off,

134
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:25,340
it's understanding the intrinsic value.
Um,

135
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,713
I am no better than anybody else.
Nobody else has better than me because 

136
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:30,980
I've got an intrinsic value that can't 
be taken away.

137
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,413
The other thing is to understand that no
aspect of your behavior can define your 

138
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:40,790
value as a person.
So for me will say like my,

139
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,663
my creativity,
like my mental health is very much 

140
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:46,160
attached to my creativity.
If,

141
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,053
if I'm creating,
then chances are I'm in a good mental 

142
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,534
place,
you know,

143
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,583
if I'm procrastinating,
that's what I ended up down the anxiety 

144
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:55,730
land.
Do you know what I'm saying?

145
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,210
But for me,
the crucial thing is tonight,

146
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,560
horrible theme park.
Yeah.

147
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,280
Anxiety.
So I,

148
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,110
uh,
I just,

149
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:09,430
I make sure that my creativity,
like if,

150
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:10,264
if I released a fucking short story or a
podcast or whatever and it doesn't do 

151
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:13,454
very well,
I have to be very cautious around how 

152
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:18,050
much I beat myself up over that I can't 
allow my,

153
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:18,884
an aspect of my behavior such as 
creativity to define my value as a 

154
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,010
person,
as important as very interesting because

155
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:25,641
I,
you know,

156
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:28,070
as a person that sort of toyed with the 
celebrity,

157
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,233
like I find it extremely difficult and 
that model that I just described of 

158
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,770
attachment eeg with pornography or a 
substance misuse,

159
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,980
if I start becoming overly attached yet 
even to our list podcast is done well,

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,720
this has been unwell.

161
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,640
Then suddenly,
yeah.

162
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:46,550
Then are googling your name,
Google your name.

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,600
Do not

164
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,600
who yourself write up the name.
No good ever.
