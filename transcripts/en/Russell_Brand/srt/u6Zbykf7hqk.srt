1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,550
Part of the documentary that actually 
I'm,

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,840
I'm glad is there though.
You didn't want there,

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,760
but you know,
I wasn't the producer and I gave all the

4
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:07,200
rights to,
it's the only way to be fair with it.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,240
The producer,
after I worked with a young woman,

6
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:10,074
you may remember who was this woman,
she was in a cult where they abused as 

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:15,750
children,
number four,

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,620
Dev sex.
It was

9
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,690
yes.
And that blew you away.

10
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,840
That that was a really,
really,

11
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:21,080
cause it was moved by that.
And I was at,

12
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:24,550
when I say the bit where you see you in 
the room when you've got a little bit of

13
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:26,410
downtime and you're like,
that really blew you away.

14
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,423
And that's how I was going on.
So people don't see that in me because 

15
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,540
if I'm crying,
they're helping her,

16
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,410
which I did the two with good.
But if I,

17
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:34,600
I won't be able help her.
So I,

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,530
it comes through me and then afterwards 
I would go and I feel the grace of that.

19
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:39,364
And to me that's often tears when it's 
so beautiful when someone's life has 

20
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:42,484
been touched.
And then I figured out what I did so I 

21
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,130
can do it again or teach someone else.

22
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,080
Are you going to sage with that energy 
when you're like,

23
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,090
uh,
like fucking hell.

24
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,120
That was a bit heavy but that our new 
feeling,

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,350
so I love what I do for anything.
It's not as intense for a start.

26
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:59,110
I'm a comedian or entertainer.
So I'm up there for an hour and a half,

27
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:00,160
two hours.
I'm like,

28
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:00,994
I,
all I've got to do is make him love and 

29
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,040
I fucking love doing it.
But afterwards,

30
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,550
like I come home and I sort of crawl 
into bed and just like,

31
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:07,940
you know,
I'd want to be told they're there.

32
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:09,330
You're all right.
You're a good boy.

33
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,140
Oh cool.
That's what I need to be told.

34
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,093
Like you know,
like sort of is that like if you got 

35
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:17,190
access to that level of vulnerability in
yourself?

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,840
I like this cause it seems to me,
this is my love bug me.

37
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,291
Like,
I mean,

38
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,124
what do I have only seen a documentary 
and had a bit of a chat based things to 

39
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,374
me that you will very,
very traumatic job and we're not 

40
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:25,744
nourished in the way that you should be.
So you had to turn yourself into your 

41
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:29,320
own nutritional source.
Yes.

42
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,260
And now you're trying to solve all of 
the world's problems.

43
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:33,670
Well,
not one individual at a time.

44
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:35,270
I've been in rooms where there's 10,000
of them,

45
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,053
but like,
uh,

46
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,360
that's a lot of intensity because it's 
sort of actually,

47
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:41,194
even though,
you know,

48
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,273
prior,
in the earlier chat you told me like 

49
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:45,064
that they put all that athletic 
monitoring equipment on you and said 

50
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:48,454
that you burned 11,000
calories in nine hours and your heart's 

51
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,700
doing this and your house.
And they're like,

52
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,593
yeah,
I believe that in the ability of 

53
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:57,910
consciousness and we'll to alter anatomy
into a material to a degree.

54
00:01:57,911 --> 00:02:00,190
But the simple fact is it ultimately 
that you're,

55
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,750
um,
a man,

56
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,510
where are you going with that 
vulnerability?

57
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:06,490
What are you doing?
Have you got like a mentor?

58
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,750
Someone that you can call?

59
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,460
Not many.
I've what's really beautiful,

60
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:13,340
my life,
the grace of my life is I've been called

61
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,920
to help others and they look at me as 
their coach,

62
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:16,754
but I'd be an idiot.
The kind of people I have the privilege 

63
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:19,970
of coaching to think I'm just coaching 
them.

64
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,360
I go there just like I did with you.
I wanted to interview.

65
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:24,194
I reached out to you.
Unfortunately you want to chat with me 

66
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,720
too,
which I was grateful for,

67
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,763
but I wanted to reach you because I feel
you have a very special voice when it 

68
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:32,490
comes to recovery that I have not seen 
anywhere else.

69
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:36,770
So you have a passion and a truth and a 
vulnerability and I have a lot of that,

70
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:37,604
but I'm only one person,
so I'm good at finding brilliant people 

71
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:41,234
and then helping to pull out so other 
people can see at least the people that 

72
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,200
I have an audience for,
you know,

73
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,810
20 million people on social media and 
they talk to people,

74
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:49,280
so hopefully it reaches even more.

75
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,280
So I'm always on the hunt for human 
excellence.

76
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:55,940
I'm on the hunt for someone who's real.
My vulnerability is absolutely there.

77
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:56,774
But I've trained myself like an athlete,
like the most common question I've been 

78
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,240
asked by the media my entire life,
it always makes me laugh is,

79
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,800
well,
don't you have bad days?

80
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:03,634
Don't you have days when you're like 
fresh state and desired and pissed off 

81
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:09,730
and you watch TV and eat cheetos and 
watch pornography?

82
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,121
And I said,
well,

83
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:13,330
I do some of those things.
And of course I do.

84
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:14,740
But what I,
it's like an athlete.

85
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:18,520
I built muscle over the years so that 
it's not that they don't have feelings,

86
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:20,890
I don't get hurt her of the side of the 
pie for all those things,

87
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,140
but they're not the dominant force in my
wife.

88
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,063
It's a muscle.
The mind is a muscle emotion as a 

89
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:26,470
muscle.

90
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,303
I mean,
I think the most powerful muscles are 

91
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,520
the invisible force muscles.
It's your spiritual,

92
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:33,250
emotional muscles like courage on you 
doesn't grow,

93
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,130
shrinks.
So I put my ass on the line regularly so

94
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:36,964
that it grows and what keeps growing.
And pretty soon the stuff that used to 

95
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:40,600
make me crazy,
it doesn't touch me.

96
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:43,420
It's not that I'm so great just I'm well
trained.

97
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,390
I trained his mine.
I get up every morning in my life.

98
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,283
You're talking about rebound,
her more crazy shit ideas everywhere in 

99
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:50,014
your life.
If I'm near,

100
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,450
if I'm near any of my homes and some 
places I have,

101
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,373
I have cryotherapy but my homes,
I have these coal punches and our 56 

102
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:57,544
degrees and the first thing I do is jump
on their coal point so there's not a 

103
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:02,410
fucking morning where I want to jump in 
that I can't remember.

104
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,850
More intact could jump on that thing,
but I don't negotiate with myself.

105
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,990
I do it for two reasons.
One,

106
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:10,720
there's a physical health component 
moves your lymph system ever.

107
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,460
The blood flushes through your whole 
body,

108
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,940
but the main reason I do it even more 
than that is when I got up there,

109
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:17,560
I don't get how people negotiate.
Well,

110
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,210
I'm able to tomorrow I'm going to do 
this or oh,

111
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,120
let me like two more minutes till I'm 
ready Earth.

112
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,470
None of that shit with me for decades.
I go,

113
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,830
I say do.
I'm not here to discuss the shit with my

114
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:30,250
mind,
their mind and their soul and spirit and

115
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:32,260
soul and spirit.
My Soul fucking knows.

116
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:34,060
And when I say jump,
you fucking jump.

117
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,890
I'm not here to have a discussion with 
you.

118
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,753
Now,
does that happen with my water every 

119
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:38,711
day?
Yes,

120
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:39,610
because I've conditioned it.

121
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,470
Does it happen every of my life?
No.

122
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:44,110
And when I find it's not working and I 
stepped back up and condition it,

123
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,283
and unless I'm willing to take a hundred
percent responsibility for what I feel 

124
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:48,484
and what I experienced,
then I'm always going to be a victim to 

125
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:50,854
someone.
Cause there's always going to be 

126
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:54,280
somebody's upset in the world we live in
today about something you said or did or

127
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:55,660
didn't say or didn't do.
Go.

128
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,110
There is no victory in the world where 
everyone has a voice and not everybody's

129
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:03,160
voices necessarily designed to make 
somebody feel loved.

130
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,500
It's designed to meet whatever their 
needs are in that moment,

131
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:08,440
they might want certainty and you're 
being a certain way makes them uncertain

132
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,274
or they think you're significant.
You may think they're totally 

133
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,130
significant,
but they don't.

134
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:14,920
So they're mad.
So I can't live my life that way.

135
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,280
So I live my life where I keep learning,
I keep growing,

136
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,143
I keep loving,
I keep laughing and I'm trying to leave 

137
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:21,754
a decent legacy of a meaningful life by 
constantly looking for ways that can be 

138
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:27,160
helpful.
And my prayer,

139
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,740
simple prayer before I walk on at every 
stage is use me,

140
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,890
use me Lord.
And,

141
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,430
and when you do that,
it's like if you get out of the way,

142
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:35,260
my greatest gift is getting out of the 
way.

143
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,260
I know that sounds silly to some people,
but it's really true.

144
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:39,094
I'm not an ultra religious person,
but I'm extremely spiritual and I 

145
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,110
believe the force of life comes through 
me.

146
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,430
It comes through,
comes through all of us,

147
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:46,264
and the only gets in the way is all the 
beliefs we have of how it's supposed to 

148
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:50,470
be.
All the expectations we have.

149
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:53,170
And I have them too,
but I keep leading them out.

150
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,063
So I'm not,
I don't want to give you the impression 

151
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,134
that I'm,
uh,

152
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,100
I don't have challenges and things that 
nature,

153
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:00,530
but I have a hell of a lot fewer.
It takes a lot more.

154
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,390
When something happens like this happen,
I go,

155
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:03,224
oh worthy opponent.
Because in every story of a person's 

156
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:07,640
life,
they have what they want and desire.

157
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:10,220
And then they have these needs that 
they're unaware of,

158
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,223
you know,
character things that need to be 

159
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,820
developed.
And how do those get developed?

160
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,140
Well,
if what you wanted,

161
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,450
you just took action happened.
Hey you'd be bored.

162
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:19,760
Be you've never developed spiritually or
your character.

163
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:20,594
And so what happens is opponent show up 
and the opponent can be you with 

164
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:24,734
yourself.
The opponent can be somebody close to 

165
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,950
you that feels like a bone or it could 
be an external force.

166
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,450
But if you do battle with this,
eventually you badly with yourself.

167
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,730
Cause if you can solve it within 
yourself,

168
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,250
you can what we're to what happened to 
the outside world.

169
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:39,140
You can have that sense that your life 
is meaningful.

170
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:39,974
And so I've been battling for 58 years 
and I'm going to keep doing battle the 

171
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:44,260
rest of my life.
But I'm,

172
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,250
I'm doing better cause I've done battle 
so often.

173
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:50,060
It's like why is Lebron James who he is?
It's not because he's lucky,

174
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,223
you know?
How do I say?

175
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,083
Yeah,
he's lucky.

176
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,500
He made have certain physical factions 
where Michael Jordan,

177
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,870
I remember I interviewed him years ago 
and I said,

178
00:06:56,871 --> 00:07:00,320
what makes you the best in the world?
Is it skill as a town is that ability is

179
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:01,370
a backward,
is a training,

180
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,870
and he was so awesome.
He said,

181
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:03,704
Tony,
I can tell you the truth that it won't 

182
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:07,460
sound like hyperbole or false modesty.
He said,

183
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,360
I didn't even make the high school 
basketball team my sophomore year.

184
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:12,950
I was cut.
He said,

185
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:13,784
what it is is every day I demand more 
from myself than anybody else could 

186
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:18,650
possibly expect.
I don't compete with other people.

187
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:22,460
I compete with what I'm capable of.
And it's just like that kind of standard

188
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,440
is inspiring.

189
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,450
They see.
It reminds me a lot.

190
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,130
I had this conversation with Tom Cruise,
right?

191
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:27,964
It was like another Americans have great
square jawed superstar and like he was 

192
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:34,430
sort of saying about how he made his 
success himself.

193
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,870
I goes,
no,

194
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,440
but you were born with the Tom Cruise 
Shit like you had that.

195
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:40,780
Even the will,
but the will,

196
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,190
you know there's not a,
you might as well.

197
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,500
Where do you think will come through?

198
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,070
Where did you will come from?
I don't know.

199
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,323
Where do you think it comes from?
I think that would be better or 

200
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,900
something you have to push against or 
you don't develop it.

201
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:54,734
How do you build a muscle?
You don't build muscle because you were 

202
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,650
born with it.
We're all born with muscle,

203
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,010
but events developed.
You trained it and that means you got to

204
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:03,470
find something that you valued more than
your pain.

205
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,980
You got to get beyond your pain or you 
got to use your pain and say,

206
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:10,640
I'm going to use it to become more.
That's what my life's been about and now

207
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:13,850
it's no longer driven by pain is driven 
by the joy of seeing people lit up.
